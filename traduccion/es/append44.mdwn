How did Bolshevik ideology contribute to the failure of the Revolution?
=======================================================================

It is a truism of Leninism that Stalinism has nothing to do with the
ideas of Bolshevism. Moreover, most are at pains to stress that these
ideas have no relation to the actual practice of the Bolshevik Party
after the October Revolution. To re-quote one Leninist:

> *"it was overwhelmingly the force of circumstance which obliged the
> Bolsheviks to retreat so far from their own goals. They travelled this
> route in opposition to their own theory, not because of it -- no
> matter what rhetorical justifications were given at the time."* [John
> Rees, *"In Defence of October,"* pp. 3-82, **International
> Socialism**, no. 52, p. 70]

His fellow party member Duncan Hallas argued that it was *"these
desperate conditions"* (namely terrible economic situation combined with
civil war) which resulted in *"the Bolshevik Party [coming] to
substitute its own rule for that of a decimated, exhausted working
class"* anarchists disagree. [**Towards a Revolutionary Socialist
Party**, p. 43]

We have discussed in the appendix on ["What caused the degeneration of
the Russian Revolution?"](append43.html) why the various *"objective
factors"* explanations favoured by Leninists to explain the defeat of
the Russian Revolution are unconvincing. Ultimately, they rest on the
spurious argument that if only what most revolutionaries (including,
ironically, Leninists!) consider as inevitable side effects of a
revolution did not occur, then Bolshevism would have been fine. It is
hard to take seriously the argument that if only the ruling class
disappeared without a fight, if the imperialists had not intervened and
if the economy was not disrupted then Bolshevism would have resulted in
socialism. This is particularly the case as Leninists argue that only
**their** version of socialism recognises that the ruling class will
**not** disappear after a revolution, that we will face
counter-revolution and so we need a state to defend the revolution! As
we argued in [section H.2.1](secH2.html#sech21), this is not the case.
Anarchists have long recognised that a revolution will require defending
and that it will provoke a serious disruption in the economic life of a
country.

Given the somewhat unrealistic tone of these kinds of assertions, it is
necessary to look at the ideological underpinnings of Bolshevism and how
they played their part in the defeat of the Russian Revolution. This
section, therefore, will discuss why such Leninist claims are not true.
Simply put, Bolshevik ideology **did** play a role in the degeneration
of the Russian Revolution. This is obvious once we look at most aspects
of Bolshevik ideology as well as the means advocated by the Bolsheviks
to achieve their goals. Rather than being in opposition to the declared
aims of the Bolsheviks, the policies implemented by them during the
revolution and civil war had clear relations with their pre-revolution
ideas and visions. To quote Maurice Brinton's conclusions after looking
at this period:

> *"there is a clear-cut and incontrovertible link between what happened
> under Lenin and Trotsky and the later practices of Stalinism. We know
> that many on the revolutionary left will find this statement hard to
> swallow. We are convinced however that any honest reading of the facts
> cannot but lead to this conclusion. The more one unearths about this

> -- or because (as the future beneficiaries of a society similar to the
> Russian one) it is their interest to remain so."* [**The Bolsheviks
> and Workers' Control**, p. 84]

This is unsurprising. The Leninist idea that politics of the Bolsheviks
had no influence on the outcome of the revolution, that their policies
during the revolution were a product purely of objective forces, is
unconvincing. The facts of the matter is that people are faced with
choices, choices that arise from the objective conditions that they
face. What decisions they make will be influenced by the ideas they hold
-- they will **not** occur automatically, as if people were on
auto-pilot -- and their ideas are shaped by the social relationships
they experience. Thus, someone who favours centralisation and sees
nationalisation as the defining characteristic of socialism will make
different decisions than someone who favours decentralising power and
sees self-management as the key issue. The former will also create
**different** forms of social organisation based on their perceptions of
what "socialism" is and what is "efficient." Similarly, the different
forms of social organisation favoured will also impact on how a
revolution develops and the political decisions they make. For example,
if you have a vision which favours centralised, hierarchical
organisation then those placed into a position of power over others
within such structures will act in certain ways, have a certain world
view, which would be alien to someone subject to egalitarian social
relations.

In summary, the ideas in people's heads matter, including during a
revolution. Someone in favour of centralisation, centralised power and
who equates party rule with class rule (like Lenin and Trotsky), will
act in ways (and create structures) totally different from someone who
believes in decentralisation and federalism. The organisation they
create will create specific forms of social relationships which, in
turn, will shape the ideas of those subject to them. This means that a
centralised, hierarchical system will create authoritarian social
relationships and these will shape those within them and the ideas they
have in totally different ways than a decentralised, egalitarian system.

Similarly, if Bolshevik policies hastened the alienation of working
class people and peasants from the regime which, in turn, resulted in
resistance to them then some of the "objective factors" facing Lenin's
regime were themselves the products of earlier political decisions.
Unwelcome and unforeseen (at least to the Bolshevik leadership)
consequences of specific Bolshevik practices and actions, but still
flowing from Bolshevik ideology all the same. So, for example, when
leading Bolsheviks had preconceived biases against decentralisation,
federalism, "petty-bourgeois" peasants, "declassed" workers or
"anarcho-syndicalist" tendencies, this would automatically become an
ideological determinant to the policies decided upon by the ruling
party. While social circumstances may have limited Bolshevik options,
these social circumstances were also shaped by the results of Bolshevik
ideology and practice and, moreover, possible solutions to social
problems were also limited by Bolshevik ideology and practice.

So, **political ideas do matter.** And, ironically, the very Leninists
who argue that Bolshevik politics played no role in the degeneration of
the revolution accept this. Modern day Leninists, while denying
Bolshevik ideology had a negative on the development of the revolution
also subscribe to the contradictory idea that Bolshevik politics were
essential for its "success"! Indeed, the fact that they **are**
Leninists shows this is the case. They obviously think that Leninist
ideas on centralisation, the role of the party, the *"workers' state"*
and a host of other issues are correct and, moreover, essential for the
success of a revolution. They just dislike the results when these ideas
were applied in practice within the institutional context these ideas
promote, subject to the pressures of the objective circumstances they
argue **every** revolution will face!

Little wonder anarchists are not convinced by Leninist arguments that
their ideology played no role in the rise of Stalinism in Russia. Simply
put, if you use certain methods then these will be rooted in the
specific vision you are aiming for. If you think socialism is state
ownership and centralised planning then you will favour institutions and
organisations which facilitate that end. If you want a highly
centralised state and consider a state as simply being an *"instrument
of class rule"* then you will see little to worry about in the
concentration of power into the hands of a few party leaders. However,
if you see socialism in terms of working class managing their own
affairs then you will view such developments as being fundamentally in
opposition to your goals and definitely **not** a means to that end.

So part of the reason why Marxist revolutions yield such anti-working
class outcomes is to do with its ideology, methods and goals. It has
little to do with the will to power of a few individuals (important a
role as that can play, sometimes, in events). In a nutshell, the
ideology and vision guiding Leninist parties incorporate hierarchical
values and pursue hierarchical aims. Furthermore, the methods and
organisations favoured to achieve (their vision of) "socialism" are
fundamentally hierarchical, aiming to ensure that power is centralised
at the top of pyramidal structures in the hands of the party leaders.

It would be wrong, as Leninists will do, to dismiss this as simply a
case of "idealism." After all, we are talking about the ideology of a
ruling party. As such, these ideas are more than just ideas: after the
seizure of power, they became a part of the real social situation within
Russia. Individually, party members assumed leadership posts in all
spheres of social life and started to apply their ideology. Then,
overtime, the results of this application ensured that the party could
not be done otherwise as the framework of exercising power had been
shaped by its successful application (e.g. Bolshevik centralism ensured
that all its policies were marked by centralist tendencies, simply
because Bolshevik power had become centralised). Soon, the only real
instance of power is the Party, and very soon, only the summits of the
Party. This cannot help but shape its policies and actions. As
Castoriadis argues:

> *"If it is true that people's real social existence determines their
> consciousness, it is from that moment illusory to expect the Bolshevik
> party to act in any other fashion than according to its real social
> position. The real social situation of the Party is that of a
> directorial organ, and its point of view toward this society
> henceforth is not necessarily the same as the one this society has
> toward itself."* [**The role of Bolshevik Ideology in the birth of the
> Bureaucracy**, p. 97]

As such, means and ends are related and cannot be separated. As Emma
Goldman argued, there is *"no greater fallacy than the belief that aims
and purposes are one thing, while methods and tactics are another. This
conception is a potent menace to social regeneration. All human
experience teaches that methods and means cannot be separated from the
ultimate aim. The means employed become, through individual habit and
social practice, part and parcel of the final purpose; they influence
it, modify it, and presently the aims and means become identical. . .
The great and inspiring aims of the Revolution became so clouded with
and obscured by the methods used by the ruling political power that it
was hard to distinguish what was temporary means and what final purpose.
Psychologically and socially the means necessarily influence and alter
the aims. The whole history of man is continuous proof of the maxim that
to divest one's methods of ethical concepts means to Sink into the
depths of utter demoralisation. In that lies the real tragedy of the
Bolshevik philosophy as applied to the Russian Revolution. May this
lesson not be in vain."* In summary, *"[n]o revolution can ever succeed
as a factor of liberation unless the MEANS used to further it be
identical in spirit and tendency with the PURPOSES to be achieved."*
[**My Disillusionment in Russia**, pp. 260-1]

If this analysis of the anarchists against Bolshevism is true then it
follows that the Bolsheviks were not just wrong on one or two issues but
their political outlook right down to the core was wrong. Its vision of
socialism was flawed, which produced a flawed perspective on the
potentially valid means available to achieve it. Leninism, we must never
forget, does not aim for the same kind of society anarchism does. As we
discussed in [section H.3.1](secH3.html#sech31), the short, medium and
long term goals of both movements are radically different. While both
claim to aim for "communism," what is mean by that word is radically
different in details if somewhat similar in outline. The anarchist ideal
of a classless, stateless and free society is based on a decentralised,
participatory and bottom-up premise. The Leninist ideal is the product
of a centralised, party ruled and top-down paradigm.

This explains why Leninists advocate a democratic-centralist
"Revolutionary Party." It arises from the fact that their programme is
the capture of state power in order to abolish the *"anarchy of the
market."* Not the abolition of wage labour, but its universalisation
under the state as one big boss. Not the destruction of alienated forces
(political, social and economic) but rather their capture by the party
on behalf of the masses. In other words, this section of the FAQ is
based on the fact that Leninists are not (libertarian) communists; they
have not broken sufficiently with Second International orthodoxy, with
the assumption that socialism is basically state capitalism (*"The idea
of the State as Capitalist, to which the Social-Democratic fraction of
the great Socialist Party is now trying to reduce Socialism."* [Peter
Kropotkin, The Great French Revolution, vol. 1, p. 31]). Just as one
cannot abolish alienation with alienated means, so we cannot attack
Leninist *"means"* also without distinguishing our libertarian *"ends"*
from theirs.

This means that both Leninist means and ends are flawed. Both will fail
to produce a socialist society. As Kropotkin said at the time, the
Bolsheviks *"have shown how the Revolution is **not** to be made."*
[quoted by Berkman, **The Bolshevik Myth**, p. 75] If applied today,
Leninist ideas will undoubtedly fail from an anarchist point of view
while, as under Lenin, "succeeding" from the limited perspective of
Bolshevism. Yes, the party may be in power and, yes, capitalist property
may be abolished by nationalisation but, no, a socialist society would
be no nearer. Rather we would have a new hierarchical and class system
rather than the classless and free society which non-anarchist
socialists claim to be aiming for.

Let us be perfectly clear. Anarchists are **not** saying that Stalinism
will be the inevitable result of any Bolshevik revolution. What we are
saying is that some form of class society will result from any such a
revolution. The exact form this class system will take will vary
depending on the objective circumstances it faces, but no matter the
specific form of such a post-revolutionary society it will not be a
socialist one. This is because of the ideology of the party in power
will shape the revolution in specific ways which, by necessity, form new
forms of hierarchical and class exploitation and oppression. The
preferred means of Bolshevism (vanguardism, statism, centralisation,
nationalisation, and so on) will determine the ends, the ends being not
communist anarchism but some kind of bureaucratic state capitalist
society labelled *"socialism"* by those in charge. Stalinism, in this
perspective, was the result of an interaction of certain ideological
goals and positions as well as organisational principles and preferences
with structural and circumstantial pressures resulting from the specific
conditions prevalent at the time. For example, a Leninist revolution in
an advanced western country would not require the barbaric means used by
Stalinism to industrialise Russia.

This section of the FAQ will, therefore, indicate the key areas of
Bolshevik ideology which, when applied, will undermine any revolution as
they did the Russian. As such, it is all fine and well for Trotskyist
Max Shachtman (like so many others) to argue that the Bolsheviks had
*"convert[ed] the expediencies and necessities of the civil war period
into virtues and principles which had never been part of their original
program."* Looking at this *"original program"* we can see elements of
what was latter to be applied. Rather than express a divergence it could
be argued that it was this that undermined the more democratic aspects
of their original program. In other words, perhaps the use of state
power and economic nationalisation came into conflict with, and finally
destroyed, the original proclaimed socialist principles? And, perhaps,
the *"socialist"* vision of Bolshevism was so deeply flawed that even
attempting to apply it destroyed the aspirations for liberty, equality
and solidarity that inspired it? For, after all, as we indicated in
[section H.3.1](secH3.html#sech31), the anarchist and mainstream Marxist
visions of socialism and how to get there **are** different. Can we be
surprised if Marxist means cannot achieve anarchist (i.e. authentic
socialist) ends? To his credit, Shachtman acknowledges that post-civil
war salvation "required full democratic rights" for all workers, and
that this was *"precisely what the Bolsheviks . . . were determined not
to permit."* Sadly he failed to wonder **why** the democratic principles
of the *"original program"* were only *"honoured in the breach"* and why
*"Lenin and Trotsky did not observe them."* The possibility that Bakunin
was right and that statism and socialism cannot go together was not
raised. [*"Introduction"* to Trotsky's **Terrorism and Communism**, p.
xv]

Equally, there is a tendency of pro-Leninists to concentrate on the
period between the two revolutions of 1917 when specifying what
Bolshevism "really" stood for, particularly Lenin's book State and
Revolution. To use an analogy, when Leninists do this they are like
politicians who, when faced with people questioning the results of their
policies, ask them to look at their election manifesto rather than what
they have done when in power. As we discuss in [section
4](append41.html#app4) of the appendix ["What happened during the
Russian Revolution?"](append41.html) Lenin's book was never applied in
practice. From the very first day, the Bolsheviks ignored it. After 6
months **none** of its keys ideas had been applied. Indeed, in all cases
the exact opposite had been imposed. As such, to blame (say) the civil
war for the reality of "Bolshevik in power" (as Leninists do) seems
without substance. Simply put, **State and Revolution** is no guide to
what Bolshevism "really" stood for. Neither is their position **before**
seizing power if the realities of their chosen methods (i.e. seizing
state power) quickly changed their perspective, practice **and**
ideology (i.e. shaped the desired ends). Assuming of course that most of
their post-October policies were radically different from their
pre-October ones, which (as we indicate here) they were not.

With that said, what do anarchists consider the key aspects of Bolshevik
ideology which helped to ensure the defeat of the Russian Revolution and
had, long before the civil war started, had started its degeneration
into tyranny? These factors are many and so we will, by necessity,
concrete on the key ones. These are believe in centralisation, the
confusion of party power with popular power, the Marxist theory of the
state, the negative influence of Engels' infamous essay *"On
Authority",* the equation of nationalisation and state capitalism with
socialism, the lack of awareness that working class economic power was a
key factor in socialism, the notion that "big" was automatically "more
efficient," the identification of class consciousness with supporting
the party, how the vanguard party organises itself and, lastly, the
underlying assumptions that vanguardism is based on.

Each one of these factors had a negative impact on the development of
the revolution, combined they were devastating. Nor can it be a case of
keeping Bolshevism while getting rid of some of these positions. Most go
to the heart of Bolshevism and could only be eliminated by eliminating
what makes Leninism Leninist. Thus some Leninists now pay lip service to
workers' control of production and recognise that the Bolsheviks saw the
form of property (i.e., whether private or state owned) as being far
more important that workers' management of production. Yet revising
Bolshevism to take into account this flaw means little unless the others
are also revised. Simply put, workers' management of production would
have little impact in a highly centralised state ruled over by a equally
centralised vanguard party. Self-management in production or society
could not co-exist with a state and party power nor with *"centralised"*
economic decision making based on nationalised property. In a nutshell,
the only way Bolshevism could result in a genuine socialist society is
if it stopped being Bolshevik!

1 How did the Marxist historical materialism affect Bolshevism?
---------------------------------------------------------------

As is well known, Marx argued that history progressed through distinct
stages. After his death, this *"materialist conception of history"*
became known as *"historical materialism."* The basic idea of this is
that the *"totality of [the] relations of production constitutes the
economic structure of society, the real foundation, on which arises a
legal and political superstructure and to which correspond definite
forms of social consciousness . . . At a certain stage of development,
the material productive forces of society come into conflict with the
existing relations of production or -- this merely expresses the same
thing in legal terms -- with the property relations within the framework
of which they have operated hitherto. From forms of development of
productive forces these relations turn into their fetters. Then begins
an era of social revolution."* [**A Contribution to the Critique of
Political Economy**, pp. 20-1]

Thus slavery was replaced by feudalism, feudalism with capitalism. For
Marx, the *"bourgeois mode of production is the last antagonistic form
of the social process of production"* and *"the productive forces
developing within bourgeois society create also the material conditions
for a solution of this antagonism."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 21] In other
words, after capitalism there would be socialism:

> *"The monopoly of capital becomes a fetter upon the mode of production
> which has flourished alongside and under it. The centralisation of the
> means of production and the socialisation of labour reach a point at
> which they become incompatible with their capitalist integument. The
> integument is burst asunder. The knell of capitalist private property
> sounds. The expropriators are expropriated."* [Karl Marx, **Capital**,
> vol. 1, p. 929]

Socialism replaces capitalism once the *"**proletariat seized political
power and turns the means of production into state property."*** By so
doing, *"it abolishes itself as proletariat, abolishes all class
distinctions and class antagonisms, abolishes also the state as state."*
[Engels, **The Marx-Engels Reader**, p. 713]

Most Marxists subscribe to this schema of historical progress. For
example, Tony Cliff noted that, *"[f]or Lenin, whose Marxism was never
mechanical or fatalistic, the definition of the dictatorship of the
proletariat as a **transition period** meant that there could be **two**
outcomes of this phase: going forward to socialism, or backsliding to
capitalism. The policy of the party would tip the balance."*
[**Revolution Besieged**, p. 364]

Marxists, like Marx, argue that socialism was the society which would
come after capitalism. Thus the Bolsheviks had the mindset that whatever
they did there was only two possibilities: (their version of) socialism
or the restoration of capitalism. However, this is based on a false
premise. Is it valid to assume that there is only one possible
post-capitalist future, one that, by definition, is classless? If so,
then any action or structure could be utilised to fight reaction as
after victory there can be only one outcome. However, if there is more
that one post-capitalist future then the question of means becomes
decisive. If we assume just two possible post-capitalist futures, one
based on self-management and without classes and another with economic,
social and political power centralised in a few hands, then the means
used in a revolution become decisive in determining which possibility
will become reality.

If we accept the Marxist theory and assume only one possible
post-capitalist system, then all that is required of revolutionary
anti-capitalist movements is that they only need to overthrow capitalism
and they will wind up where they wish to arrive as there is no other
possible outcome. But if the answer no, then in order to wind up where
we wish to arrive, we have to not only overthrow capitalism, we have use
means that will push us toward the desired future society. As such,
**means** become the key and they cannot be ignored or downplayed in
favour of the ends -- particularly as these ends will never be reached
if the appropriate means are not used.

This is no abstract metaphysical or ideological/theoretical point. The
impact of this issue can be seen from the practice of Bolshevism in
power. For Lenin and Trotsky, **any** and **all** means could and were
used in pursuit of their ends. They simply could not see how the means
used shaped the ends reached. Ultimately, there was only two
possibilities -- socialism (by definition classless) or a return to
capitalism.

Once we see that because of their flawed perspective on what comes after
capitalism we understand why, for the Bolsheviks, the means used and
institutions created were meaningless. We can see one of the roots for
Bolshevik indifference to working class self-management. As Samuel
Farber notes that *"there is no evidence indicating that Lenin or any of
the mainstream Bolshevik leaders lamented the loss of workers' control
or of democracy in the soviets, or at least referred to these losses as
a retreat, as Lenin declared with the replacement of War Communism by
NEP in 1921."* [**Before Stalinism**, p. 44] There was no need, for such
means had no impact on achieving the ends Bolshevik power had set
itself. As we discuss in [section 6](append44.html#app6), such questions
of meaningful working class participation in the workplace or the
soviets were considered by the likes of Trotsky as fundamentally
irrelevant to whether Bolshevik Russia was socialist or whether the
working class was the ruling class or not, incredible as it may seem.

So if we accept Marx's basic schema, then we simply have to conclude
that what means we use are, ultimately, irrelevant as there is only one
outcome. As long as property is nationalised and a non-capitalist party
holds state power, then the basic socialist nature of the regime
automatically flows. This was, of course, Trotsky's argument with regard
to Stalinist Russia and why he defended it against those who recognised
that it was a new form of class society. Yet it is precisely the rise of
Stalinism out of the dictatorship of the Bolsheviks which exposes the
limitations in the Marxist schema of historical development.

Simply put, there is no guarantee that getting rid of capitalism will
result in a decent society. As anarchists like Bakunin argued against
Marx, it is possible to get rid of capitalism while not creating
socialism, if we understand by that term a free, classless society of
equals. Rather, a Marxist revolution would *"concentrate all the powers
of government in strong hands, because the very fact that the people are
ignorant necessitates strong, solicitous care by the government. [It]
will create a single State bank, concentrating in its hands all the
commercial, industrial, agricultural, and even scientific production;
and they will divide the mass of people into two armies -- industrial
and agricultural armies under the direct command of the State engineers
who will constitute the new privileged scientific-political class."*
[**The Political Philosophy of Bakunin**, p. 289] As Bolshevism proved,
there **was** always an alternative to socialism or a reversion to
capitalism, in this case **state** capitalism.

So libertarians have long been aware that actually existing capitalism
could be replaced by another form of class society. As the experience of
Bolshevik tyranny proves beyond doubt, this perspective is the correct
one. And that perspective ensured that during the Russian Revolution the
Makhnovists **had** to encourage free soviets and workers'
self-management, freedom of speech and organisation in order for the
revolution to remain socialist (see the appendix on ["Why does the
Makhnovist movement show there is an alternative to
Bolshevism?"](append46.html)). In contrast, the Bolsheviks implemented
party dictatorship, nationalisation and one-man management while
proclaiming this had something to do with socialism. Little wonder
Trotsky had such difficulties understanding the obvious truth that
Stalinism has **nothing** to do with socialism.

2 Why did the Marxist theory of the state undermine working class power?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

As discussed in [section H.3.7](secH3.html#sech37), anarchists and
Marxists have fundamentally different definitions of what constitutes a
state. These different definitions resulted, in practice, to the
Bolsheviks undermining **real** working class power during the Russian
Revolution in favour of an abstract "power" which served as little more
than a fig-leaf for Bolshevik power.

For anarchists, the state is marked by centralised power in the hands of
a few. The state, we argue, is designed to ensure minority rule and,
consequently, cannot be used by the majority to manage their own
affairs. Every bourgeois revolution, moreover, has been marked by a
conflict between centralised power and popular power and,
unsurprisingly, the bourgeois favoured the former over the latter. As
such, we would expect centralised power (i.e. a state) to be the means
by which a minority class seized power **over** the masses and never the
means by which the majority managed society themselves. It was for this
reason that anarchists refuse to confuse a federation of self-managed
organisations with a state:

> *"The reader knows by now that the anarchists refused to use the term
> 'State' even for a transitional situation. The gap between
> authoritarians and libertarians has not always been very wide on this
> score. In the First International the collectivists, whose spokesman
> was Bakunin, allowed the terms 'regenerate State,' 'new and
> revolutionary State,' or even 'socialist State' to be accepted as
> synonyms for 'social collective.' The anarchists soon saw, however,
> that it was rather dangerous for them to use the same word as the
> authoritarians while giving it a quite different meaning. They felt
> that a new concept called for a new word and that the use of the old
> term could be dangerously ambiguous; so they ceased to give the name
> 'State' to the social collective of the future."* [Daniel Guerin,
> **Anarchism**, pp. 60-1]

This is no mere semantics. The essence of statism is the removal of
powers that should belong to the community as whole (though they may for
reasons of efficiency delegate their actual implementation to elected,
mandated and recallable committees) into the hands of a tiny minority
who claim to act on our behalf and in our interests but who are not
under our direct control. In other words it continues the division into
rulers and ruled. Any confusion between two such radically different
forms of organisation can only have a seriously negative effect on the
development of any revolution. At its most basic, it allows those in
power to develop structures and practices which disempower the many
while, at the same time, taking about extending working class "power."

The roots of this confusion can be found at the root of Marxism. As
discussed in [section H.3.7](secH3.html#sech37), Marx and Engels had
left a somewhat contradictory inheritance on the nature and role of the
state. Unlike anarchists, who clearly argued that only confusion would
arise by calling the organs of popular self-management required by a
revolution a *"state,"* the founders of Marxism confused two radically
different ideas. On the one hand, there is the idea of a radical and
participatory democracy (as per the model of the Paris Commune). On the
other, there is a centralised body with a government in charge (as per
the model of the democratic state). By using the term *"state"* to cover
these two radically different concepts, it allowed the Bolsheviks to
confuse party power with popular power and, moreover, replace the latter
by the former without affecting the so-called "proletarian" nature of
the state. The confusion of popular organs of self-management with a
state ensured that these organs **were** submerged by state structures
and top-down rule.

By confusing the state (delegated power, necessarily concentrated in the
hands of a few) with the organs of popular self-management Marxism
opened up the possibility of a *"workers' state"* which is simply the
rule of a few party leaders over the masses. The *"truth of the
matter,"* wrote Emma Goldman, *"is that the Russian people have been
**locked out** and that the Bolshevik State -- even as the bourgeois
industrial master -- uses the sword and the gun to keep the people out.
In the case of the Bolsheviki this tyranny is masked by a world-stirring
slogan . . . Just because I am a revolutionist I refuse to side with the
master class, which in Russia is called the Communist Party."* [**My
Disillusionment in Russia**, p. xlix] In this, she simply saw in
practice that which Bakunin had predicted would happen. For Bakunin,
like all anarchists, *"every state power, every government, by its
nature and by its position stands outside the people and above them, and
must invariably try to subject them to rules and objectives which are
alien to them."* It was for this reason *"we declare ourselves the
enemies of every government and state every state power . . . the people
can only be happy and free when they create their own life, organising
themselves from below upwards."* [**Statism and Anarchy**, p. 136]

The *"workers' state"* proved no exception to that generalisation. The
roots of the problem, which expressed itself from the start during the
Russian revolution, was the fatal confusion of the state with organs of
popular self-management. Lenin argued in *"State and Revolution"* that,
on the one hand, *"the armed proletariat itself shall **become the
government**"* while, on the other, that *"[w]e cannot imagine
democracy, not even proletarian democracy, without representative
institutions."* If, as Lenin asserts, democracy *"means equality"* he
has reintroduced inequality into the "proletarian" state as the
representatives have, by definition, more power than those who elected
them. [**Essential Works of Lenin**, p. 363, p. 306 and p. 346] Yet, as
noted in [section H.1.2](secH1.html#sech12), representative bodies
necessarily place policy-making in the hands of deputies and do not (and
cannot) mean that the working class **as a class** can manage society.
Moreover, such bodies ensure that popular power can be usurped without
difficulty by a minority. After all, a minority already **does** hold
power.

True equality implies the abolition of the state and its replacement by
a federation of self-managed communes. The state, as anarchists have
long stressed, signifies a power **above** society, a concentration of
power into a few hands. Lenin, ironically, quotes Engels on the state
being marked by *"the establishment of a **public power,** which is no
longer directly identical with the population organising itself as an
armed power."* [quoted by Lenin, **Op. Cit.**, p. 275] As Lenin
supported **representative** structures rather than one based on
elected, mandated and recallable **delegates** then he has created a
*"public power"* no longer identical with the population.

Combine this with an awareness that bureaucracy must continue to exist
in the "proletarian" state then we have the ideological preconditions
for dictatorship **over** the proletariat. *"There can be no thought,"*
asserted Lenin, *"of destroying officialdom immediately everywhere,
completely. That is utopia. But to **smash** the old bureaucratic
machine at once and to begin immediately to construct a new one that
will enable all officialdom to be gradually abolished is **not**
utopia."* In other words, Lenin expected *"the gradual 'withering away'
of all bureaucracy."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 306 and p. 307]

Yet why expect a "new" bureaucracy to be as easy to control as the old
one? Regular election to posts does not undermine the institutional
links, pressures and powers a centralised "officialdom" will generate
around itself, even a so-called "proletarian" one. Significantly, Lenin
justified this defence of temporary state bureaucracy by the kind of
straw man argument against anarchism *"State and Revolution"* is riddled
with. *"We are not utopians,"* asserted Lenin, *"we do not indulge in
'dreams' of dispensing **at once** with all administration, with all
subordination: these anarchist dreams . . . are totally alien to
Marxism, and, as a matter of fact, serve only to postpone the socialist
revolution until human nature has changed. No, we want the socialist
revolution with human nature as it is now, with human nature that cannot
dispense with subordination, control and 'managers.'"* [**Op. Cit.**, p.
307] Yet anarchists do not wish to *"dispense"* with *"all
administration,"* rather we wish to replace government **by**
administration, hierarchical positions (*"subordination"*) with
co-operative organisation. Equally, we see the revolution as a process
in which *"human nature"* is changed by the struggle itself so that
working class people become capable of organising itself and society
without bosses, bureaucrats and politicians. If Lenin says that
socialism *"cannot dispense"* with the hierarchical structures required
by class society why should we expect the same kinds of structures and
social relationships to have different ends just because *"red"*
managers are in power?

Thus Lenin's work is deeply ambiguous. He is confusing popular
self-management with a state structure. Anarchists argue that states, by
their very nature, are based on concentrated, centralised, alienated
power in the hands of a few. Thus Lenin's *"workers' state"* is just the
same as any other state, namely rule by a few over the many. This is
confirmed when Lenin argues that *"[u]nder socialism, **all** will take
part in the work of government in turn and will soon become accustomed
to no one governing."* In fact, once the *"overwhelming majority"* have
*"learned to administer the state **themselves**, have taken this
business into their own hands . . . the need for government begins to
disappear. The more complete democracy becomes, the nearer the moment
approaches when it becomes unnecessary. The more democratic the 'state'
of the armed workers -- which is 'no longer a state in the proper sense
of the word' -- becomes, the more rapidly does **the state** begin to
wither away."* Moreover, *"[u]ntil the 'higher' phase of communism
arrives, the Socialists demand the **strictest** control, by society
**and by the state,** of the amount of labour and of consumption."*
[**Op. Cit.**, p. 361, p. 349 and p. 345]

Clearly, the "proletarian" state is **not** based on direct, mass,
participation by the population but, in fact, on giving power to a few
representatives. It is **not** identical with *"society,"* i.e. the
armed, self-organised people. Rather than look to the popular assemblies
of the French revolution, Lenin, like the bourgeoisie, looked to
representative structures -- structures designed to combat working class
power and influence. (at one point Lenin states that *"for a certain
time not only bourgeois right, but even the bourgeois state remains
under communism, without the bourgeoisie!"* This was because *"bourgeois
right in regard to the distribution of articles of **consumption**
inevitably presupposes the existence of the **bourgeois state,** for
right is nothing without an apparatus capable of **enforcing** the
observance of the standards of right."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 346]).

Can we expect the same types of organs and social relationships to
produce different results simply because Lenin is at the head of the
state? Of course not.

As the Marxist theory of the state confused party/vanguard power with
working class power, we should not be surprised that Lenin's *"State and
Revolution"* failed to discuss the practicalities of this essential
question in anything but a passing and ambiguous manner. For example,
Lenin notes that *"[b]y educating the workers' party, Marxism educates
the vanguard of the proletariat which is capable of assuming power and
of **leading the whole people** to socialism, of directing and
organising the new order."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 288] It is not clear
whether it is the vanguard or the proletariat as a whole which assumes
power. Later, he states that *"the dictatorship of the proletariat"* was
*"the organisation of the vanguard of the oppressed as the ruling class
for the purpose of crushing the oppressors."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 337]
Given that this fits in with subsequent Bolshevik practice, it seems
clear that it is the vanguard which assumes power rather than the whole
class. The negative effects of this are discussed in [section
8](append44.html#app8).

However, the assumption of power by the party highlights the key problem
with the Marxist theory of the state and how it could be used to justify
the destruction of popular power. It does not matter in the Marxist
schema whether the class or the party is in power, it does not impact on
whether the working class is the *"ruling class"* or not. As Lenin put
it. *"democracy is **not** identical with the subordination of the
minority to the majority. Democracy is a **state** which recognises the
subordination of the minority to the majority, i.e. an organisation for
the systematic use of **violence** by one class against the other, by
one section of the population against another."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 332]
Thus the majority need not actually *"rule"* (i.e. make the fundamental
decisions) for a regime to be considered a *"democracy"* or an
instrument of class rule. That power can be delegated to a party
leadership (even dictatorship) without harming the *"class nature"* of
the state. This results of such a theory can be seen from Bolshevik
arguments in favour of party dictatorship during the civil war period
(and beyond).

The problem with the centralised, representative structures Lenin
favours for the *"dictatorship of the proletariat"* is that they are
rooted in the inequality of power. They constitute in fact, if not
initially in theory, a power **above** society. As Lenin put it, *"the
**essence** of bureaucracy"* is *"privileged persons divorced from the
masses and **superior to** the masses."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 360] In the
words of Malatesta, a *"government, that is a group of people entrusted
with making laws and empowered to use the collective power to oblige
each individual to obey them, is already a privileged class and cut off
from the people. As any constituted body would do, it will instinctively
seek to extend its powers, to be beyond public control, to impose its
own policies and to give priority to its special interests. Having been
put in a privileged position, the government is already at odds with the
people whose strength it disposes of."* [**Anarchy**, p. 34] As we
discussed in appendix ["What happened during the Russian
Revolution?"](append41.html), Lenin's regime provides more than enough
evidence to support such an analysis.

This is the fatal flaw in the Marxist theory of the state. As Bakunin
put it, *"the theory of the state"* is *"based on this fiction of
pseudo-popular representation -- which in actual fact means the
government of the masses by an insignificant handful of privileged
individuals, elected (or even not elected) by mobs of people rounded up
for voting and never knowing what or whom they are voting for -- on this
imaginary and abstract expression of the imaginary thought and will of
the all the people, of which the real, living people do not have the
faintest idea."* Thus the state represents *"government of the majority
by a minority in the name of the presumed stupidity of the one and the
presumed intelligence of the other."* [**Op. Cit.**, pp. 136-7]

By confusing popular participation with a state, by ignoring the real
inequalities of power in any state structure, Marxism allowed Lenin and
the Bolsheviks to usurp state power, implement party dictatorship
**and** continue to talk about the working class being in power. Because
of Marxism's metaphysical definition of the state (see [section
H.3.7](secH3.html#sech37)), actual working class people's power over
their lives is downplayed, if not ignored, in favour party power.

As parties represent classes in this schema, if the party is in power
then, by definition, so is the class. This raises the possibility of
Lenin asserting the *"working class"* held power even when his party was
exercising a dictatorship **over** the working class and violently
repressing any protests by it. As one socialist historian puts it,
*"while it is true that Lenin recognised the different functions and
democratic raison d'etre for both the soviets and his party, in the last
analysis it was the party that was more important than the soviets. In
other words, the party was the final repository of working-class
sovereignty. Thus, Lenin did not seem to have been reflected on or have
been particularly perturbed by the decline of the soviets after 1918."*
[Samuel Farber, **Before Stalinism**, p. 212] This can be seen from how
the Marxist theory of the state was changed **after** the Bolsheviks
seized power to bring into line with its new role as the means by which
the vanguard ruled society (see [section H.3.8](secH3.html#sech38)).

This confusion between two radically different concepts and their
submersion into the term *"state"* had its negative impact from the
start. Firstly, the Bolsheviks constantly equated rule by the Bolshevik
party (in practice, its central committee) with the working class as a
whole. Rather than rule by all the masses, the Bolsheviks substituted
rule by a handful of leaders. Thus we find Lenin talking about *"the
power of the Bolsheviks -- that is, the power of the proletariat"* as if
these things were the same. Thus it was a case of *"the Bolsheviks"*
having *"to take the whole governmental power into their own hands,"* of
*"the complete assumption of power by the Bolsheviks alone,"* rather
than the masses. Indeed, Russia had been *"ruled by 130,000 landowners"*
and *"yet they tell us that Russia will not be able to be governed by
the 240,000 members of the Bolshevik Party -- governing in the interests
of the poor and against the rich."* [**Will the Bolsheviks Maintain
Power?**, p. 102, p. 7 and pp. 61-2]

However, governing in the *"interests"* of the poor is **not** the same
as the poor governing themselves. Thus we have the first key
substitution that leads to authoritarian rule, namely the substitution
of the power of the masses by the power of a few members who make up the
government. Such a small body will require a centralised state system
and, consequently, we have the creation of a hierarchical body around
the new government which, as we discuss in [section
7](append44.html#app7), will become the real master in society.

The preconditions for a new form of class society have been created and,
moreover, they are rooted in the basic ideas of Marxism. Society has
been split into two bodies, the masses and those who claim to rule in
their name. Given this basic inequality in power we would, according to
anarchist theory, expect the interests of the masses and the rulers to
separate and come into conflict. While the Bolsheviks had the support of
the working class (as they did in the first few months of their rule),
this does not equal mass participation in running society. Quite the
reverse. So while Lenin raised the vision of mass participation in the
*"final"* stage of communism, he unfortunately blocked the means to get
there.

Simply put, a self-managed society can only be created by self-managed
means. To think we can have a *"public power"* separate from the masses
which will, slowly, dissolve itself into it is the height of naivety.
Unsurprisingly, once in power the Bolsheviks held onto power by all
means available, including gerrymandering and disbanding soviets,
suppressing peaceful opposition parties and violently repressing the
very workers it claimed ruled in *"soviet"* Russia (see [section
6](append41.html#app6) of the appendix ["What happened during the
Russian Revolution?"](append41.html)). Significantly, this conflict
developed before the start of the civil war (see [section
3](append43.html#app3) of the appendix on ["What caused the degeneration
of the Russian Revolution?"](append43.html) for details). So when
popular support was lost, the basic contradictions in the Bolshevik
position and theory became clear. Rather than be a *"soviet"* power, the
Bolshevik regime was simply rule over the workers in their name, nothing
more. And equally unsurprising, the Leninists revised their theory of
the state to take into account the realities of state power and the need
to justify minority power **over** the masses (see [section
H.3.8](secH3.html#sech38)).

Needless to say, even electoral support for the Bolsheviks should not
and cannot be equated to working class management of society. Echoing
Marx and Engels at their most reductionist (see [section
H.3.9](secH3.html#sech39)), Lenin stressed that the state was *"an organ
or machine for the subjection of one class by another . . . when the
State has become proletarian, when it has become a machine for the
domination of the proletariat over the bourgeoisie, then we shall fully
and unreservedly for a strong government and centralism."* [**Op.
Cit.**, p. 75] The notions that the state could have interests of its
own, that it is not simply an instrument of class rule but rather
**minority** class rule are nowhere to be found. The implications of
this simplistic analysis had severe ramifications for the Russian
Revolution and Trotskyist explanations of both Stalinism and its rise.

Which brings us to the second issue. It is clear that by considering the
state simply as an instrument of class rule Lenin could downplay, even
ignore, such important questions of **how** the working class can
*"rule"* society, how it can be a *"ruling"* class. Blinded by the
notion that a state could not be anything **but** an instrument of class
rule, the Bolsheviks simply were able to justify any limitation of
working class democracy and freedom and argue that it had no impact on
whether the Bolshevik regime was really a "dictatorship of the
proletariat" or not. This can be seen from Lenin's polemic with German
Social-Democrat Karl Kautsky, where he glibly stated that *"**[t]he form
of government,** has absolutely nothing to so with it."* [**Collected
Works**, vol. 28, p. 238]

Yet the idea that there is a difference between **who** rules in a
revolutionary situation and **how** they rule is a key one, and one
raised by the anarchists against Marxism. After all, if the working
class is politically expropriated how can you maintain that a regime is
remotely "proletarian"? Ultimately, the working class can only *"rule"*
society through its collective participation in decision making (social,
economic and "political"). If working class people are not managing
their own affairs, if they have delegated that power to a few party
leaders then they are **not** a ruling class and could never be. While
the bourgeoisie can, and has, ruled economically under an actual
dictatorship, the same cannot be said to be the case with the working
class. Every class society is marked by a clear division between order
takers and order givers. To think that such a division can be
implemented in a socialist revolution and for it to remain socialist is
pure naivety. As the Bolshevik revolution showed, representative
government is the first step in the political expropriation of the
working class from control over their fate.

This can best be seen by Trotsky's confused analyses of Stalinism. He
simply could not understand the nature of Stalinism with the simplistic
analytical tools he inherited from mainstream Marxism and Bolshevism.
Thus we find him arguing in 1933 that:

> *"The dictatorship of a class does not mean by a long shot that its
> entire mass always participates in the management of the state. This
> we have seen, first of all, in the case of the propertied classes. The
> nobility ruled through the monarchy before which the noble stood on
> his knees. The dictatorship of the bourgeoisie took on comparatively
> developed democratic forms only under the conditions of capitalist
> upswing when the ruling class had nothing to fear. Before our own
> eyes, democracy has been supplanted in Germany by Hitler's autocracy,
> with all the traditional bourgeois parties smashed to smithereens.
> Today, the German bourgeoisie does not rule directly; politically it
> is placed under complete subjection to Hitler and his bands.
> Nevertheless, the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie remains inviolate in
> Germany, because all the conditions of its social hegemony have been
> preserved and strengthened. By expropriating the bourgeoisie
> politically, Hitler saved it, even if temporarily, from economic
> expropriation. The fact that the bourgeoisie was compelled to resort
> to the fascist regime testifies to the fact that its hegemony was
> endangered but not at all that it had fallen."* [Trotsky, **The Class
> Nature Of The Soviet State**]

Yet Trotsky is confusing the matter. He is comparing the actions of
class society with those a socialist revolution. While a minority class
need not *"participate"* **en mass** the question arises does this apply
to the transition from class society to a classless one? Can the working
class **really** can be *"expropriated"* politically and still remain
*"the ruling class"*? Moreover, Trotsky fails to note that the working
class was **economically** and **politically** expropriated under
Stalinism as well. This is unsurprising, as both forms of expropriation
had occurred when he and Lenin held the reins of state power. Yet
Trotsky's confused ramblings do serve a purpose in showing how the
Marxist theory of the state can be used to rationalise the replacement
of popular power by party power. With such ideological baggage, can it
be a surprise that the Bolshevik replacement of workers' power by party
power could be a revolutionary goal? Ironically, the Marxist theory of
the state as an instrument of class rule helped ensure that the Russian
working class did **not** become the ruling class post-October. Rather,
it ensured that the Bolshevik party did.

To conclude, by its redunctionist logic, the Marxist theory of the state
ensured that the substitution of popular power by party power could go
ahead and, moreover, be justified ideologically. The first steps towards
party dictatorship can be found in such apparently "libertarian" works
as Lenin's *"State and Revolution"* with its emphasis on
"representation" and "centralisation." The net effect of this was to
centralise power into fewer and fewer hands, replacing the essential
constructive working class participation and self-activity required by a
social revolution with top-down rule by a few party leaders. Such rule
could not avoid becoming bureaucratised and coming into conflict with
the real aspirations and interests of those it claimed to represent. In
such circumstances, in a conflict between the *"workers' state"* and the
actual workers the Marxist theory of the state, combined with the
assumptions of vanguardism, made the shift to party dictatorship
inevitable. As we discussed in [section 3](append43.html#app3) of the
appendix on ["What caused the degeneration of the Russian
Revolution?"](append43.html), authoritarian tendencies had surfaced
before the civil war began.

The strange paradox of Leninism, namely that the theoretical
dictatorship of the proletariat was, in practice, a dictatorship
**over** the proletariat comes as no surprise. In spite of Lenin
announcing *"all power to the soviets"* he remained committed to a
disciplined party wielding centralised power. This regime soon
expropriated the soviets while calling the subsequent regime "Soviet."
Rather that create the authoritarian tendencies of the Bolshevik state
the "objective factors" facing Lenin's regime simply increased their
impact. The preconditions for the minority rule which the civil war
intensified to extreme levels already existed within Marxist theory.
Consequently, a Leninist revolution which avoided the (inevitable)
problems facing a revolution would still create some kind of class
society simply because it reproduces minority rule by creating a
*"workers' state"* as its first step. Sadly, Marxist theory confuses
popular self-government with a state so ensuring the substitution of
rule by a few party leaders for the popular participation required to
ensure a successful revolution.

3 How did Engels' essay *"On Authority"* affect the revolution?
---------------------------------------------------------------

We have discussed Engels' infamous diatribe against anarchism already
(see [section H.4](secH4.html) and subsequent sections). Here we discuss
how its caricature of anarchism helped disarm the Bolsheviks
theoretically to the dangers of their own actions, so helping to
undermine the socialist potential of the Russian revolution. While the
Marxist theory of the state, with its ahistoric and ambiguous use of the
word "state" undermined popular autonomy and power in favour of party
power, Engels' essay *"On Authority"* helped undermine popular
self-management.

Simply put, Engels essay contained the germs from which Lenin and
Trotsky's support for one-man management flowed. He provided the Marxist
orthodoxy required to undermine real working class power by confusing
all forms of organisation with *"authority"* and equating the necessity
of self-discipline with *"subordination"* to one will. Engels' infamous
essay helped Lenin to destroy self-management in the workplace and
replace it with appointed *"one-man management"* armed with
*"dictatorial powers."*

For Lenin and Trotsky, familiar with Engels' *"On Authority,"* it was a
truism that any form of organisation was based on *"authoritarianism"*
and, consequently, it did not really matter **how** that *"authority"*
was constituted. Thus Marxism's agnostic attitude to the patterns of
domination and subordination within society was used to justify one-man
management and party dictatorship. Indeed, *"Soviet socialist democracy
and individual management and dictatorship are in no way contradictory .
. . the will of a class may sometimes be carried by a dictator, who
sometimes does more alone and is frequently more necessary."* [Lenin,
**Collected Works**, vol. 30, p. 476]

Like Engels, Lenin defended the principle of authority. The dictatorship
of the Party over the proletariat found its apology in this principle,
thoroughly grounded in the practice of bureaucracy and modern factory
production. Authority, hierarchy, and the need for submission and
domination is inevitable given the current mode of production, they
argued. And no foreseeable change in social relations could ever
overcome this blunt necessity. As such, it was (fundamentally)
irrelevant **how** a workplace is organised as, no matter what, it would
be *"authoritarian."* Thus *"one-man management"* would be, basically,
the same as worker's self-management via an elected factory committee.

For Engels, any form of joint activity required as its *"first
condition"* a *"dominant will that settles all subordinate questions,
whether this will is represented by a single delegate or a committee
charged with the execution of the resolutions of the majority of persons
interested. In either case there is very pronounced authority."* Thus
the *"necessity of authority, and of imperious authority at that."*
Collective life, he stressed, required *"a certain authority, no matter
how delegated"* and *"a certain subordination, are things which,
independently of all social organisation, are imposed upon us."* [**The
Marx-Engels Reader**, p. 732]

Lenin was aware of these arguments, even quoting from this essay in his
**State and Revolution**. Thus he was aware that for Engels, collective
decisions meant *"the will of the single individual will always have to
subordinate itself, which means that questions are settled in an
authoritarian way."* Thus there was no difference if *"they are settled
by decision of a delegate placed at the head of each branch of labour
or, if possible, by a majority vote."* The more advanced the technology,
the greater the *"despotism"*: *"The automatic machinery of a big
factory is much more despotic than the small capitalist who employ
workers ever have been."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 731] Thus Engels had used
the modern factory system of mass production as a direct analogy to
argue against the anarchist call for workers' councils and
self-management in production, for workers' autonomy and participation.
Like Engels, Lenin stressed the necessity of central authority in
industry.

It can be argued that it was this moment that ensured the creation of
state capitalism under the Bolsheviks. This is the moment in Marxist
theory when the turn from economics to technics, from proletarian
control to technocracy, from workers' self-management to appointed state
management was ensured. Henceforth the end of any critique of alienation
in mainstream Marxism was assured. Submission to technique under
hierarchical authority effectively prevents active participation in the
social production of values. And there was no alternative.

As noted in [section 8](append41.html#app8) of the appendix ["What
happened during the Russian Revolution?"](append41.html)). and [section
H.3.14](secH3.html#sech314), during 1917 Lenin did not favour workers'
self-management of production. He raised the idea of *"workers'
control"* after the workers spontaneously raised the idea and practice
themselves during the revolution. Moreover, he interpreted that slogan
in his own way, placing it within a statist context and within
institutions inherited from capitalism (see [section
H.3.12](secH3.html#sech312)). Once in power, it was (unsurprisingly)
**his** vision of socialism and workers' control that was implemented,
**not** the workers' factory committees. The core of that vision he
repeatedly stressed had been raised **before** the October revolution.

This vision can be best seen in **The Immediate Tasks of the Soviet
Government**, written by Lenin and published on the 25th of April 1918.
This occurred before the start of the civil war and, indeed, he starts
by arguing that *"[t]hanks to the peace which has been achieved"* the
Bolsheviks had *"gained an opportunity to concentrate its efforts for a
while on the most important and most difficult aspect of the socialist
revolution, namely the task of organisation."* The Bolsheviks, who had
*"managed to complete the conquest of power,"* now faced *"the principal
task of convincing people"* and doing *"**practical organisational
work.**"* Only when this was done *"will it be possible to say that
Russia **has become** not only a Soviet, but also a socialist,
republic."* [**The Immediate Tasks of the Soviet Government**, p. 2 and
p. 8]

Sadly, this *"organisation"* was riddled with authoritarianism and was
fundamentally top-down in nature. His "socialist" vision was simply
state capitalism (see [section 10](append41.html#app10) of the appendix
["What happened during the Russian Revolution?"](append41.html)).
However, what interests us here is that his arguments to justify the
"socialist" policies he presented are similar to those put forward by
Engels in *"On Authority."* As such, we can only reach the following
conclusions. Firstly, that the *"state capitalist"* vision of socialism
imposed upon Russia by the Bolsheviks was what they had always intended
to introduce. It was their limited support for workers' control in 1917
that was atypical and not part of their tradition, **not** their
policies once in power (as modern day Leninists assert). Secondly, that
this vision had its roots in classical Marxism, specifically Engels'
*"On Authority"* and the identification of socialism with nationalised
property (see [section H.3.13](secH3.html#sech313) for more on this).

That Engels diatribe had a negative impact on the development of the
Russian revolution can easily be seen from Lenin's arguments. For
example, Lenin argues that the *"tightening of discipline"* and
*"harmonious organisation"* calls *"for coercion -- coercion precisely
in the form of dictatorship."* He did not object to granting
*"individual executives dictatorial power (or 'unlimited' powers)"* and
did not think *"the appointment of individual, dictators with unlimited
power"* was incompatible with *"the fundamental principles of the Soviet
government."* After all, *"the history of revolutionary movements"* had
*"shown"* that *"the dictatorship of individuals was very often the
expression, the vehicle, the channel of the dictatorship of
revolutionary classes."* He notes that *"[u]ndoubtably, the dictatorship
of individuals was compatible with bourgeois democracy."* [**Op. Cit.**,
p. 28 and p. 32] It would be churlish to note that previous
revolutionary movements had not been **socialist** in nature and did not
aim to **abolish** classes. In such cases, the government appointing
people with dictatorial powers would not have harmed the nature of the
revolution, which was transferring power from one minority class to
another.

Lenin mocked the *"exceedingly poor arguments"* of those who objected,
saying that they *"demand of us a higher democracy than bourgeois
democracy and say: personal dictatorship is absolutely incompatible with
your, Bolshevik (i.e. not bourgeois, **but socialist**) Soviet
democracy."* As the Bolsheviks were *"not anarchists,"* he admitted the
need *"coercion"* in the *"transition from capitalism to socialism,"*
its form being determined *"by the degree of development of the given
revolutionary class, and also by special circumstances."* In general, he
stressed, there was *"absolutely **no** contradiction in principle
between Soviet (**that is,** socialist) democracy and the exercise of
dictatorial powers by individuals."* [**Op. Cit.**, pp. 32-3 and p. 33]
Which is, of course, sophistry as dictatorship by a few people in some
aspects of live will erode democracy in others. For example, being
subject to the economic power of the capitalist during work harms the
individual and reduces their ability to participate in other aspects of
social life. Why should being subject to "red" bosses be any different?

In particular, Lenin argued that *"individual dictatorial power"* was
required because *"large-scale machine industry"* (which is the
*"foundation of socialism"*) calls for *"absolute and strict **unity of
will,** which directs the joint labours of hundreds, thousands and tens
of thousands of people. . . But how can strict unity of will be ensured?
By thousands subordinating their will to the will of one."* He
reiterated that the *"**unquestioning subordination** to a single will
is absolutely necessary for the success of processes organised on the
pattern of large-scale machine industry."* The people must
*"**unquestioningly obey the single will** of the leaders of labour."*
And so it was a case (for the workers, at least) of *"[o]bedience, and
unquestioning obedience at that, during work to the one-man decisions of
Soviet directors, of the dictators elected or appointed by Soviet
institutions, vested with dictatorial powers."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 33, p.
34 and p. 44]

The parallels with Engels' *"On Authority"* could not be clearer, as are
the fallacies of Lenin's assertions (see, for example, [section
H.4.4](secH4.html#sech44)). Lenin, like Engels, uses the example of
modern industry to bolster his arguments. Yet the net effect of Lenin's
argument was to eliminate working class economic power at the point of
production. Instead of socialist social relationships, Lenin imposed
capitalist ones. Indeed, no capitalist would disagree with Lenin's
workplace regime -- they try to create such a regime by breaking unions
and introducing technologies and techniques which allow them to control
the workers. Unsurprisingly, Lenin also urged the introduction of two
such techniques, namely *"piece-work"* and *"applying much of what is
scientific and progressive in the Taylor system."* [**Op. Cit.**, pp.
23-4] As Trotskyist Tony Cliff reminds us, *"the employers have at their
disposal a number of effective methods of disrupting th[e] unity [of
workers as a class]. Once of the most important of these is the
fostering of competition between workers by means of piece-work
systems."* He notes that these were used by the Nazis and the Stalinists
*"for the same purpose."* [**State Capitalism in Russia**, pp. 18-9]
Obviously piece-work is different when Lenin introduces it! Similarly,
when Trotsky notes that *"[b]lind obedience is not a thing to be proud
of in a revolutionary,"* it is somewhat different when Lenin calls upon
workers to do so (or, for that matter, Trotsky himself when in power --
see [section 6](append44.html#app6) for Trotsky's radically different
perspective on blind obedience of the worker to "his" state in 1920!).
[**Terrorism and Communism**, p. xlvii]

The **economic** dominance of the bourgeoisie ensures the political
dispossession of the working class. Why expect the introduction of
capitalist social relations in production to have different outcomes
just because Lenin was the head of the government? In the words of
libertarian socialist Maurice Brinton:

> *"We hold that the 'relations of production' -- the relations which
> individuals or groups enter into with one another in the process of
> producing wealth - are the essential foundations of any society. A
> certain pattern of relations of production is the common denominator
> of all class societies. This pattern is one in which the producer does
> not dominate the means of production but on the contrary both is
> 'separated from them' and from the products of his own labour. In all
> class societies the producer is in a position of subordination to
> those who manage the productive process. Workers' management of
> production -- implying as it does the total domination of the producer
> over the productive process -- is not for us a marginal matter. It is
> the core of our politics. It is the only means whereby authoritarian
> (order-giving, order-taking) relations in production can be
> transcended and a free, communist or anarchist, society introduced.*
> "We also hold that the means of production may change hands (passing
> for instance from private hands into those of a bureaucracy,
> collectively owning them) with out this revolutionising the relations
> of production. Under such circumstances -- and whatever the formal
> status of property -- the society is still a class society for
> production is still managed by an agency other than the producers
> themselves. Property relations, in other words, do not necessarily
> reflect the: relations of production. They may serve to mask them --
> and in fact they often have." [**The Bolsheviks and Workers'
> Control**, p. vii-viii]

The net effect of Lenin's arguments, as anarchist Peter Arshinov noted a
few years later, was that the *"fundamental fact"* of the Bolshevik
revolution was *"that the workers and the peasant labourers remained
within the earlier situation of 'working classes' -- producers managed
by authority from above."* He stressed that Bolshevik political and
economic ideas may have *"remov[ed] the workers from the hands of
individual capitalists"* but they *"delivered them to the yet more
rapacious hands of a single ever-present capitalist boss, the State. The
relations between the workers and this new boss are the same as earlier
relations between labour and capital . . . Wage labour has remained what
it was before, expect that it has taken on the character of an
obligation to the State. . . . It is clear that in all this we are
dealing with a simple substitution of State capitalism for private
capitalism."* [**The History of the Makhnovist Movement**, p. 35 and p.
71] Moreover, Lenin's position failed to understand that unless workers
have power at the point of production, they will soon loose it in
society as a whole. Which, of course, they soon did in Bolshevik Russia,
even in the limited form of electing a "revolutionary" government.

So while the causes of the failure of the Russian Revolution were many
fold, the obvious influence of Engels' *"On Authority"* on the fate of
the workers' control movement should be noted. After all, Engels'
argument confuses the issues that Bakunin and other anarchists were
trying to raise (namely on the nature of the organisations we create and
our relationships with others). If, as Engels' argues, all organisation
is *"authoritarian,"* then does this mean that there no real difference
between organisational structures? Is a dictatorship just the same as a
self-managed group, as they are both organisations and so both
*"authoritarian"*? If so, surely that means the kinds of organisation we
create are irrelevant and what **really** matters is state ownership?
Such logic can only lead to the perspective that working class
self-management of production is irrelevant to socialism and,
unfortunately, the experience of the Russian Revolution tends to suggest
that for mainstream Marxism this is the case. The Bolsheviks imposed
distinctly authoritarian social structures while arguing that they were
creating socialism.

Like Engels, the Bolsheviks defended the principle of authority. The
dictatorship of the Party over the proletariat in the workplace (and,
indeed, elsewhere) ultimately found its apology in this principle,
thoroughly grounded in the practice of bureaucracy and modern factory
production. Authority, hierarchy, and the need for submission and
domination is inevitable, given the current mode of production, they
argued. And, as Engels had stressed, no foreseeable change in social
relations could ever overcome this blunt necessity. As such, it was
(fundamentally) irrelevant for the leading Bolsheviks **how** a
workplace is organised as, no matter what, it would be
*"authoritarian."* Thus *"one-man management"* would be, basically, the
same as worker's self-management via an elected factory committee. As
Trotsky made clear in 1920, for the Bolsheviks the *"dictatorship of the
proletariat is expressed in the abolition of private property in the
means of production, in the supremacy over the whole Soviet mechanism of
the collective will of the workers [i.e. the party, which Trotsky
cheerfully admits is exercising a **party** dictatorship], and not at
all in the form in which individual economic enterprises are
administered."* Thus, it *"would be a most crying error to confuse the
question as to the supremacy of the proletariat with the question of
boards of workers at the head of the factories."* [**Terrorism and
Communism**, p. 162]

By equating *"organisation"* with *"authority"* (i.e. hierarchy) and
dismissing the importance of revolutionising the social relationships
people create between themselves, Engels opened the way for the
Bolsheviks' advocacy of *"one-man management."* His essay is at the root
of mainstream Marxism's agnostic attitude to the patterns of domination
and subordination within society and was used to justify one-man
management. After all, if Engels was right, then it did not matter
**how** the workplace was organised. It would, inherently, be
*"authoritarian"* and so what mattered, therefore, was who owned
property, **not** how the workplace was run. Perhaps, then, *"On
Authority"* was a self-fulfilling prophecy -- by seeing any form of
organisation and any form of advanced technology as needing hierarchy,
discipline and obedience, as being "authoritarian," it ensured that
mainstream Marxism became blinded to the key question of **how** society
was organised. After all, if *"despotism"* was a fact of life within
industry regardless of how the wider society was organised, then it does
not matter if *"one-man management"* replaces workers' self-management.
Little wonder then that the continued alienation of the worker was
widespread long before Stalin took power and, more importantly, before
the civil war started.

As such, the dubious inheritance of classical Marxism had started to
push the Bolshevik revolution down an authoritarian path and create
economic structures and social relationships which were in no way
socialist and, moreover, laid the foundations for Stalinism. Even if the
civil war had not occurred, capitalist social relationships would have
been dominant within "socialist" Russia -- with the only difference
being that rather than private capitalism it would have been state
capitalism. As Lenin admitted, incidentally. It is doubtful that this
state capitalism would have been made to serve *"the whole people"* as
Lenin naively believed.

In another way Engels identification of organisation with authority
affected the outcome of the revolution. As **any** form of organisation
involved, for Engels, the domination of individuals and, as such,
*"authoritarian"* then the nature of the socialist state was as
irrelevant as the way workplaces were run. As both party dictatorship
and soviet democracy meant that the individual was *"dominated"* by
collective decisions, so both were *"authoritarian."* As such, the
transformation of the soviet state into a party dictatorship did not
fundamentally mean a change for the individuals subject to it. Little
wonder that no leading Bolshevik called the end of soviet democracy and
its replacement by party dictatorship as a "retreat" or even as
something to be worried about (indeed, they all argued the opposite,
namely that party dictatorship was essential and not an issue to be
worried about).

Perhaps this analogy by the SWP's Tony Cliff of the relationship between
the party and the working class provides an insight:

> *"In essence the dictatorship of the proletariat **does not**
> represent a combination of abstract, immutable elements like democracy
> and centralism, independent of time and space. The actual level of
> democracy, as well as centralism, depends on three basic factors: 1.
> the strength of the proletariat; 2. the material and cultural legacy
> left to it by the old regime; and 3. the strength of capitalist
> resistance. The level of democracy feasible must be indirect
> proportion to the first two factors, and in inverse proportion to the
> third. The captain of an ocean liner can allow football to be played
> on his vessel; on a tiny raft in a stormy sea the level of tolerance
> is far lower."* [**Lenin**, vol. 3, p. 179]

Ignoring the obvious points (such as comparing working class freedom and
democracy to a game!), we can see shades of Engels in Cliff's words. Let
us not forget that Engels argued that *"a ship on the high seas"* at a
*"time of danger"* required *"the necessity of authority, and of
imperious authority at that."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 732] Here Cliff is
placing the party into the Captain's role and the workers as the crew.
The Captain, in Engels argument, exercised *"imperious authority."* In
Cliff's, the party decides the freedoms which working class people are
allowed to have -- and so subjects them to its *"imperious authority."*

Little wonder Bolshevism failed. By this simple analogy Cliff shows the
authoritarian essence of Bolshevism and who really has *"all power"*
under that system. Like the crew and passengers dominated by the will of
the captain, the working class under Leninism will be dominated by the
party. It does not bode well that Cliff thinks that democracy can be
*"feasible"* in some circumstances, but not others and it is up to those
in power (i.e. the party leaders) to determine when it was. In his rush
to justify Bolshevik party dictatorship in terms of "objective
conditions" he clearly forgot his earlier comments that the *"liberation
of the working class can only be achieved through the action of the
working class. Hence one can have a revolution with more or less
violence, with more or less suppression of civil rights of the
bourgeoisie and its hangers-on [a general catch-all category which, if
Bolshevik practice is anything to go by, can include rebel workers,
indeed the whole working class!], with more or less political freedom,
but one **cannot** gave a revolution, as the history of Russia
conclusively demonstratives, without workers' democracy -- even if
restricted and distorted. Socialist advance must be gauged by workers'
freedom, by their power to shape their own destiny . . . Without
workers' democracy the immediate means leads to a very different end, to
an end that is prefigured in these same means."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 110]
Obviously if Lenin and Trotsky are the captains of the ship of state,
such considerations are less important. When it is Lenin wielding
*"imperious authority"* then workers' democracy can be forgotten and the
regime remain a *"workers' state"*!

By ignoring the key issue Bakunin and other anarchists drew attention to
by attacking *"authority"* (and let us not forget that by that they
meant hierarchical organisations in which power is concentrated at the
top in a few hands -- see [section H.4](secH4.html)), Engels opened up
the way of seeing democratic decision as being less than important. This
is **not** to suggest that Engels favoured dictatorship. Rather we are
suggesting that by confusing two radically different forms of
organisation as self-management and hierarchy he blunted latter Marxists
to the importance of participation and collective decision making from
below. After all, if all organisation is *"authoritarian"* then it
matters little, in the end, how it is structured. Dictatorship,
representative democracy and self-management were all equally
*"authoritarian"* and so the issues raised by anarchism can safely be
ignored (namely that electing bosses does not equate to freedom). Thus
the Bolshevik willingness to equate their dictatorship with rule by the
working class is not such a surprise after all.

To conclude, rather than the anti-authoritarians not knowing *"what they
are talking about,"* *"creating nothing but confusion,"* *"betraying the
movement of the proletariat"* and *"serv[ing] the reaction,"* it was
Engels' essay that aided the Bolshevik counter-revolution and helped, in
its own small way, to lay the foundations for Leninist tyranny and state
capitalism. [Engels, **Op. Cit.**, p. 733] Ultimately, Engels *"On
Authority"* helped give Lenin the ideological premises by which to
undermine workers' economic power during the revolution and recreate
capitalist social relations and call it "socialism." His ill thought out
diatribe had ramifications even he would never have guessed (but were
obvious at the time to libertarians). His use of the modern factory
system to argue against the anarchist call for workers' councils,
federalism and workers' autonomy, for participation, for
self-management, became the basis for re-imposing **capitalist**
relations of production in revolutionary Russia.

4 How did the Bolshevik vision of "democracy" affect the revolution?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

As discussed in [section H.3.2](secH3.html#sech32), Marx and Engels had
left their followers which a contradictory legacy as regards *"socialism
from below."* On the one hand, their praise for the Paris Commune and
its libertarian ideas pointed to a participatory democracy run from
below. On the other, Marx's comments during the German Revolution in
1850 that the workers must *"strive for . . . the most determined
centralisation of power in the hands of the state authority"* because
*"the path of revolutionary activity"* can "proceed only from the
centre" suggests a top-down approach. He stressed that centralisation of
power was essential to overcome local autonomy, which would allow
*"every village, every town and every province"* to put *"a new obstacle
in the path"* the revolution due to *"local and provincial obstinacy."*
[**Marx-Engels Reader**, p. 509]

Building upon this contradictory legacy, Lenin unambiguously stressed
the *"from above"* aspect of it (see [section H.3.3](secH3.html#sech33)
for details). The only real exception to this perspective occurred in
1917, when Lenin was trying to win mass support for his party. However,
even this support for democracy from below was always tempered by
reminding the reader that the Bolsheviks stood for centralisation and
strong government once they were in power (see [section
7](append44.html#app7)).

Once in power, the promises of 1917 were quickly forgotten.
Unsurprisingly, modern day Leninists argue that this was due to the
difficult circumstances facing the Bolsheviks at the time. They argue
that the words of 1917 represent the true democratic vision of
Bolshevism. Anarchists are not impressed. After all, for an idea to be
useful it must be practical -- even in "exceptional circumstances." If
the Bolshevik vision is not robust enough to handle the problems that
have affected every revolution then we have to question the validity of
that vision or the strength of commitment its supporters hold it.

Given this, the question becomes which of these two aspects of Marxism
was considered its "essence" by Lenin and the Bolsheviks. Obviously, it
is hard to isolate the real Bolshevik vision of democracy from the
influence of "objective factors." However, we can get a taste by looking
at how the Bolsheviks acted and argued during the first six months in
power. During this period, the problems facing the revolution were hard
but not as bad as those facing it after the Czech revolt at the end of
May, 1918. Particularly after March, 1918, the Bolsheviks were in a
position to start constructive work as in the middle of that month Lenin
claimed that the *"Soviet Government has triumphed in the Civil War."*
[quoted by Maximoff, **The Guillotine at Work**, p. 53]

So the question as to whether the Bolsheviks were forced into
authoritarian and hierarchical methods by the practical necessities of
the civil war or whether all this was inherent in Leninism all along,
and the natural product of Leninist ideology, can be answered by looking
at the record of the Bolsheviks prior to the civil war. From this we can
ascertain the effect of the civil war. And the obvious conclusion is
that the record of the initial months of Bolshevik rule point to a less
than democratic approach which suggests that authoritarian policies were
inherent in Leninism and, as such, pointed the revolution into a path
were further authoritarian policies were not only easy to implement, but
had to be as alternative options had been eliminated by previous
policies. Moreover, Bolshevik ideology itself made such policies easy to
accept and to justify.

As discussed in [section 6](append41.html#app6) of the appendix ["What
happened during the Russian Revolution?"](append41.html),it was during
this period that the Bolsheviks started to gerrymander soviets and
disband any they lost elections to. As we indicate in [section
9](append41.html#app9) of the appendix ["What happened during the
Russian Revolution?"](append41.html), they undermined the factory
committees, stopping them federating and basically handed the factories
to the state bureaucracy. Lenin argued for and implemented one-man
management, piecework, Taylorism and other things Stalinism is condemned
for (see [section 3](append44.html#app3), for example). In the army,
Trotsky disbanded the soldier committees and elected officers by decree.

How Trotsky defended this policy of appointing officers is significant.
It mirrors Lenin's argument in favour of appointed one-man management
and, as such, reflects the basic Bolshevik vision of democracy. By
looking at his argument we can see how the Bolshevik vision of democracy
fatality undermined the Russian Revolution and its socialist content.
The problems of the civil war simply deepened the abscess in democracy
created by Lenin and Trotsky in the spring of 1918.

Trotsky acknowledged that that *"the soldier-workers and
soldier-peasants"* needed *"to elect commanders for themselves"* in the
Tzarist army *"not [as] military chiefs, but simply [as] representatives
who could guard them against attacks of counter-revolutionary classes."*
However, in the new Red Army this was not needed as it was the
*"workers' and peasants' Soviets, i.e. the same classes which compose
the army"* which is building it. He blandly asserted that *"[h]ere no
internal struggle is possible."* To illustrate his point he pointed to
the trade unions. *"The metal workers,"* he noted, *"elect their
committee, and the committee finds a secretary, a clerk, and a number of
other persons who are necessary. Does it ever happen that the workers
should say: 'Why are our clerks and treasurers appointed, and not
elected?' No, no intelligent workers will say so."* [**Leon Trotsky
Speaks**, p. 112-3]

Thus in less than six months, Lenin's call in *"State and Revolution"*
that *"[a]ll officials, without exception, [would be] elected and
subject to recall **at any time**"* was dismissed as the demand that
*"no intelligent workers"* would raise! [**Essential Works of Lenin**,
p. 302] But, then again, Trotsky **was** in the process of destroying
another apparent *"principle"* of Leninism, namely (to quote, like
Lenin, Marx) *"the suppression of the standing army, and the
substitution for it of the armed people."* [quoted by Lenin, **Op.
Cit.**, p. 300]

Trotsky continues his argument. The Trade union committee, he asserts,
would say *"You yourselves have chosen the committee. If you don't like
us, dismiss us, but once you have entrusted us with the direction of the
union, then give us the possibility of choosing the clerk or the
cashier, since we are better able to judge in the matter than you, and
if our way of conducting business is bad, then throw us out and elect
another committee."* After this defence of elected dictatorship, he
states that the *"Soviet government is the same as the committee of a
trade union. It is elected by the workers and peasants, and you can at
the All-Russian Congress of the Soviets, at any moment you like, dismiss
that government and appoint another."* Until that happens, he was happy
to urge blind obedience by the sovereign people to their servants: *"But
once you have appointed it, you must give it the right to choose the
technical specialists, the clerks, the secretaries in the broad sense of
the word, and in military affairs, in particular."* He tried to calm the
nerves of those who could see the obvious problems with this argument by
asking whether it was *"possible for the Soviet government to appoint
military specialists against the interests of the labouring and peasant
masses?"* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 113]

And the answer to that question is, of course, an empathic yes. Even
looking at his own analogy, namely that of a trade union committee, it
is obvious that an elected body can have interests separate from and in
opposition to those who elected it. The history of trade unionism is
full of examples of committees betraying the membership of the unions.
And, of course, the history of the Soviet government under Lenin and
Trotsky (never mind Stalin!) shows that just because it was once elected
by a majority of the working people does not mean it will act in their
best interests.

Trotsky even went one better. *"The army is now only in the process of
formation,"* he noted. *"How could the soldiers who have just entered
the army choose the chiefs! Have they have any vote to go by? They have
none. And therefore elections are impossible."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 113]
If only the Tsar had thought of that one! If he had, he would still be
in power. And, needless to say, Trotsky did not apply that particular
logic to himself. After all, he had no experience of holding
governmental office or building an army (or even being in combat). Nor
did any of the other Bolshevik leaders. By the logic of his argument,
not only should the workers not been allowed to vote for a soviet
government, he and his fellow Bolsheviks should not have assumed power
in 1917. But, clearly, sauce for the goose is definitely **not** sauce
for the gander.

For all his talk that the masses could replace the Bolsheviks at the
All-Russian Congress of Soviets, Trotsky failed to realise that these
proposals (and other ones like it) ensured that this was unlikely to
happen. Even assuming that the Bolsheviks had not gerrymandered and
disbanded soviets, the fact is that the Bolshevik vision of "democracy"
effectively hollowed out the grassroots participation required to make
democracy at the top anything more than a fig-leaf for party power. He
honestly seemed to believe that eliminating mass participation in other
areas of society would have no effect on the levels of participation in
soviet elections. Would people subjected to one-man management in the
workplace and in the army really be truly free and able to vote for
parties which had not appointed their bosses? Could workers who were
disenfranchised economically and socially remain in political power
(assuming you equate voting a handful of leaders into power with
*"political power"*)? And does being able to elect a representative
every quarter to the All-Russian congress really mean that the working
class was really in charge of society? Of course not.

This vision of top-down "democracy" can, of course, be traced back to
Marx's arguments of 1850 and Lenin's comments that the *"organisational
principle of revolutionary Social-Democracy"* was *"to proceed from the
top downward."* (see sections [H.3.2](secH3.html#sech32) and
[H.3.3](secH3.html#sech33)). By equating centralised, top-down decision
making by an elected government with "democracy," the Bolsheviks had the
ideological justification to eliminate the functional democracy
associated with the factory committees and soldiers committees. In place
of workers' and soldiers' direct democracy and self-management, the
Bolsheviks appointed managers and officers and justified because a
workers' party was in power. After all, had not the masses elected the
Bolsheviks into power? This became the means by which **real** democracy
was eliminated in area after area of Russian working class life.
Needless to say, a state which eliminates functional democracy in the
grassroots will not stay democratic in any meaningful sense for long. At
best, it will be like a bourgeois republic with purely elections where
people elect a party to misrepresent them every four or so years while
real economic, political and social power rests in the hands of a few.
At worse, it would be a dictatorship with "elections" whose results are
known before hand.

The Leninist vision of "democracy" is seen purely as a means of placing
the party into power. Thus power in society shifts to the top, to the
leaders of the centralised party in charge of the centralised state. The
workers' become mere electors rather than actual controllers of the
revolution and are expected to carry out the orders of the party without
comment. In other words, a decidedly bourgeois vision of "democracy."
Anarchists, in contrast, seek to dissolve power back into the hands of
society and empower the individual by giving them a direct say in the
revolution through their workplace and community assemblies and their
councils and conferences.

This vision was not a new development. Far from it. While, ironically
enough, Lenin's and Trotsky's support for the appointment of
officers/managers can be refuted by looking at Lenin's **State and
Revolution**, the fact is that the undemocratic perspectives they are
based on can be found in Lenin's **What is to be Done?**. This suggests
that his 1917 arguments were the aberration and against the true essence
of Leninism, not his and Trotsky's policies once they were in power (as
Leninists like to argue).

Forgetting that he had argued against *"primitive democracy"* in What is
to Be Done?, Lenin had lambasted the opportunists and "present
Kautskyists" for *"repeat[ing] the vulgar bourgeois jeers at 'primitive'
democracy."* Now, in 1917, it was a case that *"the transition from
capitalism to socialism is **impossible** without some 'reversion' to
'primitive' democracy (how else can the majority, even the whole
population, proceed to discharge state functions?)"* [**Op. Cit.**, p.
302] Very true. As Leninism in power showed, the conscious elimination
of *"primitive democracy"* in the army and workplace ensured that
socialism **was** *"impossible."* And this elimination was not justified
in terms of "difficult" circumstances but rather in terms of principle
and the inability of working people to manage their own affairs
directly.

Particularly ironic, given Trotsky's trade union committee analogy was
Lenin's comment that *"Bernstein [the arch revisionist and reformist]
combats 'primitive democracy' . . . To prove that 'primitive democracy'
is worthless, Bernstein refers to the experience of the British trade
unions, as interpreted by the Webbs. Seventy years of development . . .
convinced the trade unions that primitive democracy was useless, and
they substituted ordinary democracy, i.e. parliamentarism, combined with
bureaucracy, for it."* Lenin replied that because the trade unions
operated *"**in absolute capitalist slavery**"* a *"number of
concessions to the prevailing evil, violence, falsehood, exclusion of
the poor from the affairs of the 'higher' administration 'cannot be
avoided.' Under socialism much of the 'primitive' democracy will
inevitably be revived, since, for the first time in history of civilised
society, the **mass** of the population will rise to **independent**
participation, not only in voting and elections, **but also in the
everyday administration of affairs**"* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 361] Obviously
things looked a bit different once he and his fellow Bolshevik leaders
were in power. Then the exclusion of the poor from the affairs of the
*"higher"* administration was seen as normal practice, as proven by the
practice of the trade unions! And as we note in [section
H.3.8](secH3.html#sech38), this *"exclusion"* was taken as a key lesson
of the revolution and built into the Leninist theory of the state.

This development was not unexpected. After all, as we noted in [section
H.5.5](secH5.html#sech55), over a decade before Lenin had been less than
enthralled by *"primitive democracy"* and more in agreement with
Bernstein than he lets on in **State and Revolution**. In **What is to
Be Done?**, he based his argument for centralised, top-down party
organisation on the experiences of the labour movement in democratic
capitalist regimes. He quotes the same book by the Webb's to defend his
position. He notes that *"in the first period of existence in their
unions, the British workers thought it was an indispensable sign of
democracy for all members to do all the work of managing the unions."*
This involved *"all questions [being] decided by the votes of all the
members"* and all *"official duties"* being *"fulfilled by all the
members in turn."* He dismisses *"such a conception of democracy"* as
*"absurd"* and *"historical experience"* made them *"understand the
necessity for representative institutions"* and *"full-time professional
officials."* Ironically, Lenin records that in Russia the *"'primitive'
conception of democracy"* existed in two groups, the *"masses of the
students and workers"* and the *"Economists of the Bernstein
persuasion."* [**Op. Cit.**, pp. 162-3]

Thus Trotsky's autocratic and top-down vision of democracy has its roots
within Leninism. Rather than being forced upon the Bolsheviks by
difficult circumstances, the eroding of grassroots, functional
("primitive") democracy was at the core of Bolshevism. Lenin's arguments
in 1917 were the exception, not his practice after he seized power.

This fundamentally undemocratic perspective can be found today in modern
Leninism. As well as defending the Bolshevik dictatorship during the
civil war, modern Leninists support the continuation of party
dictatorship after its end. In particular, they support the Bolshevik
repression of the Kronstadt rebellion (see appendix ["What was the
Kronstadt Rebellion?"](append42.html) for more details). As Trotsky put
it in 1937, if the Kronstadt demand for soviet elections had been
implemented then *"to free the soviets from the leadership [sic!] of the
Bolsheviks would have meant within a short time to demolish the soviets
themselves . . . Social-Revolutionary-anarchist soviets would serve only
as a bridge from the proletarian dictatorship [sic!] to capitalist
restoration."* He generalised this example, by pointing to the
*"experience of the Russian soviets during the period of Menshevik and
SR domination and, even more clearly, the experience of the German and
Austrian soviets under the domination of the Social Democrats."* [Lenin
and Trotsky, **Kronstadt**, p. 90] Modern day Leninists repeat this
argument, failing to note that they sound like leftist Henry Kissingers
(Kissinger, let us not forget, ensured US aid for Pinochet's coup in
Chile and argued that *"I don't see why we need to stand by and watch a
country go communist due to the irresponsibility of its own people"*).

Today we have Leninists combining rhetoric about democratic socialism,
with elections and recall, with a mentality which justifies the
suppression of working class revolt because they are not prepared to
stand by and watch a country go capitalist due to the irresponsibility
of its own people. Perhaps, unsurprisingly, previously in 1937 Trotsky
expressed his support for the *"objective necessity"* of the
*"revolutionary dictatorship of a proletarian party"* and, two years
later, that the *"vanguard of the proletariat"* must be *"armed with the
resources of the state in order to repel dangers, including those
emanating from the backward layers of the proletariat itself."* (see
[section H.3.8](secH3.html#sech38)). If only modern day Leninists were
as honest!

So the Bolshevik contempt for working class self-government still
exists. While few, however, explicitly proclaim the logic of this
position (namely party dictatorship) most defend the Bolsheviks
implementing this conclusion in practice. Can we not conclude that,
faced with the same problems the Bolsheviks faced, these modern day
Leninists will implement the same policies? That they will go from party
power to party dictatorship, simply because they know better than those
who elected them on such matters? That answer seems all too obvious.

As such, the Bolshevik preference for centralised state power and of
representative forms of democracy involved the substitution of the party
for the class and, consequently, will facilitate the dictatorship
**over** the proletariat when faced with the inevitable problems facing
any revolution. As Bakunin put it, a *"people's administration,
according to [the Marxists], must mean a people's administration by
virtue of a small number of representatives chosen by the people . . .
[I]t is a deception which would conceal the despotism of a governing
minority, all the more dangerous because it appears as a sham expression
of the people's will . . . [T]he vast majority, the great mass of
people, would be governed by a privileged minority . . . [of] **former**
workers, who would stop being workers the moment they became rulers or
representatives, and would then come to regard the whole blue-collared
world from governmental heights, and would not represent the people but
themselves and their pretensions."* So the Marxist state would be *"the
reign of the **scientific mind,** the most aristocratic, despotic,
arrogant and contemptuous of all regimes. There will be a new class, a
new hierarchy of real of bogus learning, and the world will be divided
into a dominant, science-based minority and a vast, ignorant majority.
And then let the ignorant masses beware!"* [**Michael Bakunin: Selected
Writings**, p. 268, pp. 268-9 and p. 266]

In summary, Trotsky's deeply undemocratic justification for appointing
officers, like Lenin's similar arguments for appointing managers,
express the logic and reality of Bolshevism far better than statements
made before the Bolsheviks seized power and never implemented. Sadly,
modern Leninists concentrate on the promises of the election manifesto
rather than the grim reality of Bolshevik power and its long standing
top-down vision of "democracy." A vision which helped undermine the
revolution and ensure its degeneration into a party dictatorship
presiding over a state capitalist economy.

5 What was the effect of the Bolshevik vision of "socialism"?
-------------------------------------------------------------

As we discussed in [section H.3.1](secH3.html#sech31), anarchists and
most Marxists are divided not only by **means** but also by **ends**.
Simply put, libertarians and Leninist do **not** have the same vision of
socialism. Given this, anarchists are not surprised at the negative
results of the Bolshevik revolution -- the use of anti-socialist means
to attain anti-socialist ends would obviously have less than desirable
results.

The content of the Bolshevik vision of "socialism" is criticised by
anarchists on two main counts. Firstly, it is a top-down, centralised
vision of "socialism." This can only result in the destruction of
working class economic power at the point of production in favour of
centralised bureaucratic power. Secondly, for Bolshevism
nationalisation, **not** workers' self-management, was the key issue. We
will discuss the first issue here and the second in the following
section.

The Bolshevik vision of "socialism" was inherently centralised and
top-down. This can be seen from the organisational schemas and arguments
made by leading Bolsheviks before and immediately after the Revolution.
For example, we discover Trotsky arguing in March 1918 that workplaces
*"will be subject to policies laid down by the local council of
workmen's deputies"* who, in turn, had *"their range of discretion . . .
limited in turn by regulations made for each class of industry by the
boards or bureaux of the central government."* He dismissed Kropotkin's
communalist ideas by saying local autonomy was not *"suited to the state
of things in modern industrial society"* and *"would result in endless
frictions and difficulties."* As the *"coal from the Donets basin goes
all over Russia, and is indispensable in all sorts of industries"* you
could not allow *"the organised people of that district [to] do what
they pleased with the coal mines"* as they *"could hold up all the rest
of Russia."* [contained in Al Richardson (ed.), **In Defence of the
Russian Revolution**, p. 186]

Lenin repeated this centralised vision in June of that year, arguing
that *"Communism requires and presupposes the greatest possible
centralisation of large-scale production throughout the country. The
all-Russian centre, therefore, should definitely be given the right of
direct control over all the enterprises of the given branch of industry.
The regional centres define their functions depending on local
conditions of life, etc., in accordance with the general production
directions and decisions of the centre."* He continued by explicitly
arguing that *"[t]o deprive the all-Russia centre of the right to direct
control over all the enterprises of the given industry . . . would be
regional anarcho-syndicalism, and not communism."* [Marx, Engels and
Lenin, **Anarchism and Anarcho-Syndicalism**, p. 292]

Thus the Bolshevik economic ideal was centralised and top-down. This is
not unsurprising, as Lenin had promised precisely this when the
Bolsheviks got into power. As in the Bolshevik party itself, the lower
organs were controlled by the higher ones (and as we will discuss, these
higher ones were not directly elected by the lower ones). The problems
with this vision are many fold.

Firstly, to impose an "ideal" solution would destroy a revolution -- the
actions and decisions (**including what others may consider mistakes**)
of a free people are infinitely more productive and useful than the
decisions and decrees of the best central committee. Moreover, a
centralised system by necessity is an imposed system (as it excludes by
its very nature the participation of the mass of the people in
determining their own fate). Thus **real** socialisation must proceed
from below, reflecting the real development and desires of those
involved. Centralisation can only result in replacing socialisation with
nationalisation and the elimination of workers' self-management with
hierarchical management. Workers' again would be reduced to the level of
order-takers, with control over their workplaces resting not in their
hands but in those of the state.

Secondly, Trotsky seems to think that workers at the base of society
would be so unchanged by a revolution that they would hold their fellow
workers ransom. And, moreover, that other workers would let them. That,
to say the least, seems a strange perspective. But not as strange as
thinking that giving extensive powers to a central body will **not**
produce equally selfish behaviour (but on a wider and more dangerous
scale). The basic fallacy of Trotsky's argument is that the centre will
not start to view the whole economy as its property (and being
centralised, such a body would be difficult to effectively control).
Indeed, Stalin's power was derived from the state bureaucracy which ran
the economy in its own interests. Not that did not suddenly arise with
Stalin. It was a feature of the Soviet system from the start. Samuel
Farber, for example, notes that, *"in practice, [the]
hypercentralisation [pursued by the Bolsheviks from early 1918 onwards]
turned into infighting and scrambles for control among competing
bureaucracies"* and he points to the *"not untypical example of a small
condensed milk plant with few than 15 workers that became the object of
a drawn-out competition among six organisations including the Supreme
Council of National Economy, the Council of People's Commissars of the
Northern Region, the Vologda Council of People's Commissars, and the
Petrograd Food Commissariat."* [**Before Stalinism**, p. 73]

In other words, centralised bodies are not immune to viewing resources
as their own property and doing as they please with it. Compared to an
individual workplace, the state's power to enforce its viewpoint against
the rest of society is considerably stronger and the centralised system
would be harder to control. The requirements of gathering and processing
the information required for the centre to make intelligent decisions
would be immense, thus provoking a large bureaucracy which would be hard
to control and soon become the **real** power in the state. A
centralised body, therefore, effectively excludes the mass participation
of the mass of workers -- power rests in the hands of a few people
which, by its nature, generates bureaucratic rule. If that sounds
familiar, it should. It is precisely what **did** happen in Lenin's
Russia and laid the basis for Stalinism.

Thirdly, to eliminate the dangers of workers' self-management generating
"propertarian" notions, the workers' have to have their control over
their workplace reduced, if not eliminated. This, by necessity,
generates bourgeois social relationships and, equally, appointment of
managers from above (which the Bolsheviks did embrace). Indeed, by 1920
Lenin was boasting that in 1918 he had *"pointed out the necessity of
recognising the dictatorial authority of single individuals for the
pursue of carrying out the Soviet idea"* and even claimed that at that
stage *"there were no disputes in connection with the question"* of
one-man management. [quoted by Brinton, **Op. Cit.**, p. 65] While the
first claim is true (Lenin argued for one-man management appointed from
above before the start of the Civil War in May 1918) the latter one is
not true (excluding anarchists, anarcho-syndicalists and Maximalists,
there were also the dissent *"Left Communists"* in the Bolshevik party
itself).

Fourthly, centralism was not that efficient. The central bodies the
Bolsheviks created had little knowledge of the local situation and often
gave orders that contradicted each other or had little bearing to
reality, so encouraging factories to ignore the centre: *"it seems
apparent that many workers themselves . . . had now come to believe . .
. that confusion and anarchy [sic!] **at the top** were the major causes
of their difficulties, and with some justification. The fact was that
Bolshevik administration was chaotic . . . Scores of competitive and
conflicting Bolshevik and Soviet authorities issued contradictory
orders, often brought to factories by armed Chekists. The Supreme
Economic Council. . . issu[ed] dozens of orders and pass[ed] countless
directives with virtually no real knowledge of affairs."* [William G.
Rosenberg, **Russian Labour and Bolshevik Power**, p. 116] The
Bolsheviks, as Lenin had promised, built from the top-down their system
of *"unified administration"* based on the Tsarist system of central
bodies which governed and regulated certain industries during the war.
[Brinton, **Op. Cit.**, p. 36] This was very centralised and very
inefficient (see [section 7](append44.html#app7) for more discussion).

Moreover, having little real understanding of the circumstances on the
ground they could not compare their ideological assumptions and
preferences to reality. As an example, the Bolshevik idea that "big" was
automatically "more efficient" and "better" had a negative impact on the
revolution. In practice, as Thomas F. Remington notes, this simply
resulted generated waste:

> *"The waste of scare materials at [the giant] Putilov [plant] was
> indeed serious, but not only political unrest had caused it. The
> general shortage of fuel and materials in the city took its greatest

> only were the workers accused of politically motivated resistance, but
> the regime blamed them for the effects of circumstances which the
> workers had no control."* [**Building Socialism in Bolshevik Russia**,
> p. 106]

All in all, the Bolshevik vision of socialism was a disaster. Centralism
was a source of massive economic mismanagement and, moreover,
bureaucratisation from the start. As anarchists had long predicted. As
we discuss in [section 12](append41.html#app12) of the appendix ["What
happened during the Russian Revolution?"](append41.html), there was an
alternative in the form of the factory committees and the federation.
Sadly this was not part of the Bolshevik vision. At best they were
tacked onto this vision as a (very) junior partner (as in 1917) or they
were quickly marginalised and then dumped when they had outlived their
usefulness in securing Bolshevik power (as in 1918).

While some Leninists like to paint the economic policies of the
Bolsheviks in power as being different from what they called for in
1917, the truth is radically different. For example, Tony Cliff of the
UK's "Socialist Workers Party" asserts, correctly, that in April 1918
the *"defence of state capitalism constituted the essence of his
economic policy for this period."* However, he also states that this was
*"an entirely new formulation,"* which was not the case in the
slightest. [Cliff, **Op. Cit.**, p. 69] As Lenin himself acknowledged.

Lenin had always confused state capitalism with socialism. *"State
capitalism,"* he wrote, *"is a complete **material** preparation for
socialism, the threshold of socialism, a rung on the ladder of history
between which and the rung called socialism **there are no gaps.**"* He
argued that socialism *"is nothing but the next step forward from state
capitalist monopoly. In other words, Socialism is merely state
capitalist monopoly **made to benefit the whole people**; by this token
it **ceases** to be capitalist monopoly."* [**The Threatening
Catastrophe and how to avoid it**, p. 38 and p. 37] This was in May,
1917. A few months latter, he was talking about how the institutions of
state capitalism could be taken over and used to create socialism (see
[section H.3.12](secH3.html#sech312)). Unsurprisingly, when defending
Cliff's *"new formulation"* against the *"Left Communists"* in the
spring of 1918 he noted that he gave his *"'high' appreciation of state
capitalism"* *"**before** the Bolsheviks seized power."* [**Selected
Works**, vol. 2, p. 636]

And, indeed, his praise for state capitalism and its forms of social
organisation can be found in his State and Revolution:

> *"the **post-office** [is] an example of the socialist system . . . At
> present . . . [it] is organised on the lines of a state **capitalist**
> monopoly. Imperialism is gradually transforming all trusts into
> organisations of a similar type . . . the mechanism of social
> management is here already to hand. Overthrow the capitalists . . .
> Our immediate object is to organise the **whole** of national economy
> on the lines of the postal system . . . It is such a state, standing
> on such an economic basis, that we need."* [**Essential Works of
> Lenin**, pp. 307-8]

Given this, Lenin's rejection of the factory committee's model of
socialism comes as no surprise (see [section 10](append41.html#app10) of
the appendix ["What happened during the Russian
Revolution?"](append41.html) for more details). As we noted in [section
H.3.14](secH3.html#sech314), rather than promote workers' control, Lenin
effectively undermined it. Murray Bookchin points out the obvious:

> *"In accepting the concept of worker's control, Lenin's famous decree
> of November 14, 1917, merely acknowledged an accomplished fact; the
> Bolsheviks dared not oppose the workers at this early date. But they
> began to whittle down the power of the factory committees. In January
> 1918, a scant two months after 'decreeing' workers' control, Lenin
> began to advocate that the administration of the factories be placed
> under trade union control. The story that the Bolsheviks 'patiently'
> experimented with workers' control, only to find it 'inefficient' and
> 'chaotic,' is a myth. Their 'patience' did not last more than a few
> weeks. Not only did Lenin oppose direct workers' control within a
> matter of weeks . . . even union control came to an end shortly after
> it had been established. By the summer of 1918, almost all of Russian
> industry had been placed under bourgeois forms of management."*
> [**Post-Scarcity Anarchism**, pp. 200-1]

Significantly, even his initial vision of workers' control was
hierarchical, centralised and top-down. In the workplace it was to be
exercised by factory committees. The *"higher workers' control bodies"*
were to be *"composed of representatives of trade unions, factory and
office workers' committees, and workers' co-operatives."* The decisions
of the lower bodies *"may be revoked only by higher workers' control
bodies."* [quoted by Cliff, **Op. Cit.**, p. 10] As Maurice Brinton
notes:

> *"there [was] . . . a firm hierarchy of control organs . . . each
> Committee was to be responsible to a 'Regional Council of Workers'
> Control', subordinated in turn to an 'All-Russian Council of Workers'
> Control'. The composition of these higher organs was decided by the
> Party.*
> "The trade unions were massively represented in the middle and higher
> strata of this new pyramid of 'institutionalised workers' control.'
> For instance the All-Russian Council of Workers' Control was to
> consist of 21 'representatives': 5 from the All-Russian Central
> Executive Committee of the Soviets, 5 from the Executive of the
> All-Russian Council of Trade Unions, 5 from the Association of

> from the Petrograd Trade Union Council, 1 from each All-Russian Trade
> Union Federation numbering fewer than 100,000 members (2 for
> Federations of over this number)... and 5 from the All-Russian Council
> of Factory Committees! The Factory Committees often under
> anarcho-syndicalist influence had been well and truly 'cut down to
> size'." [**Op. Cit.**, p. 18]

As we note in [section 10](append41.html#app10) of the appendix ["What
happened during the Russian Revolution?"](append41.html), this was a
conscious preference on Lenin's part. The factory committees had started
to federate, creating their own institutional framework of socialism
based on the workers own class organisation. Lenin, as he had explained
in 1917, favoured using the institutions created by *"state capitalism"*
and simply tacked on a form of *"workers' control"* distinctly at odds
with the popular usage of the expression. He **rejected** the
suggestions of factory committees themselves. The Supreme Economic
Council, established by the Soviet government, soon demonstrated how to
really mismanage the economy.

As such, the economic developments proposed by Lenin in early 1918 and
onwards were **not** the result of the specific problems facing the
Russian revolution. The fact is while the dire problems facing the
Russian revolution undoubtedly made many aspects of the Bolshevik system
worse, they did not create them. Rather, the centralised, bureaucratic
and top-down abuses Leninists like to distance themselves from where, in
fact, built into Lenin's socialism from the start. A form of socialism
Lenin and his government explicitly favoured and created in opposition
to other, authentically proletarian, versions.

The path to state capitalism was the one Lenin wanted to trend. It was
not forced upon him or the Bolsheviks. And, by re-introducing wage
slavery (this time, to the state) the Bolshevik vision of socialism
helped undermine the revolution, workers' power and, sadly, build the
foundations of Stalinism.

6 How did Bolshevik preference for nationalisation affect the revolution?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

As noted in the [last section](append44.html#app5), unlike anarchism,
for Bolshevism nationalisation, **not** workers' self-management, was
the key issue in socialism. As noted in [section 3](append44.html#app3),
Lenin had proclaimed the necessity for appointed one-man managers and
implementing *"state capitalism"* in April 1918. Neither policy was
thought to harm the socialist character of the regime. As Trotsky
stressed in 1920, the decision to place a manager at the head of a
factory instead of a workers' collective had no political significance:

> *"It would be a most crying error to confuse the question as to the
> supremacy of the proletariat with the question of boards of workers at
> the head of factories. The dictatorship of the proletariat is
> expressed in the abolition of private property in the means of
> production, in the supremacy of the collective will of the workers and
> not at all in the form in which individual economic organisations are
> administered."* [**Terrorism and Communism**, p. 162]

Nor was this considered a bad thing or forced upon the Bolsheviks as a
result of terrible circumstances. Quite the reverse: *"I consider if the
civil war had not plundered our economic organs of all that was
strongest, most independent, most endowed with initiative, we should
undoubtedly have entered the path of one-man management in the sphere of
economic administration much sooner and much less painfully."* [**Op.
Cit.**, pp. 162-3] As discussed in the [previous
section](append44.html#app5), this evaluation fits perfectly into
Bolshevik ideology and practice before and after they seized power. One
can easily find dozens of quotations from Lenin expressing the same
idea.

Needless to say, Trotsky's *"collective will of the workers"* was simply
a euphemism for the Party, whose dictatorship **over** the workers
Trotsky glibly justified:

> *"We have more than once been accused of having substituted for the
> dictatorship of the Soviets the dictatorship of the party. Yet it can
> be said with complete justice that the dictatorship of the Soviets
> became possible only by means of the dictatorship of the party. It is
> thanks to the . . . party . . . [that] the Soviets . . . [became]
> transformed from shapeless parliaments of labour into the apparatus of
> the supremacy of labour. In this 'substitution' of the power of the
> party for the power of the working class there is nothing accidental,
> and in reality there is no substitution at all. The Communists express
> the fundamental interests of the working class."* [**Op. Cit.**, p.
> 109]

While Trotsky's honesty on this matter is refreshing (unlike his
followers today who hypocritically talk about the "leadership" of the
Bolshevik party) we can say that this was a **fatal** position to take.
Indeed, for Trotsky **any** system (including the militarisation of
labour) was acceptable as the key *"differences . . . is defined by a
fundamental test: who is in power?"* -- the capitalist class or the
proletariat (i.e. the party) [**Op. Cit.**, pp. 171-2] Thus working
class control over their own affairs was of little importance: *"The
worker does not merely bargain with the Soviet State; no, he is
subordinated to the Soviet State, under its orders in every direction --
for it is **his** State."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 168] This, of course,
echoed his own arguments in favour of appointment (see [section
4](append44.html#app4)) **and** Lenin's demands for the *"exercise of
dictatorial powers by individuals"* in the workplace (see [section
3](append44.html#app3)) in early 1918. Cornelius Castoriadis points out
the obvious:

> *"The role of the proletariat in the new State was thus quite clear.
> It was that of enthusiastic and passive citizens. And the role of the
> proletariat in work and in production was no less clear. On the whole,
> it was the same as before -- under capitalism -- except that workers
> of 'character and capacity' [to quote Trotsky] were to be chosen to
> replace factory managers who had fled."* [**The Role of the
> Bureaucracy in the birth of the Bureaucracy**, p. 99]

Trotsky's position, it should be noted, remained consistent. In the
early 1930s he argued (in respect to Stalin's regime) that *"anatomy of
society is determined by its economic relations. So long as the forms of
property that have been created by the October Revolution are not
overthrown, the proletariat remains the ruling class."* [**The Class
Nature of The Soviet State**] Obviously, if the prime issue is property
and not who **manages** the means of production (or even *"the state"*)
then having functioning factory-committees becomes as irrelevant as
having democratic soviets when determining whether the working class is
in power or not.

(As an aside, we should not by that surprised that Trotsky could think
the workers were the *"ruling class"* in the vast prison-camp which was
Stalin's USSR, given that he thought the workers were the *"ruling
class"* when he and Lenin headed the Bolshevik party dictatorship! Thus
we have the strange division Leninists make between Lenin's dictatorship
and Stalin's (and those of Stalin's followers). When Lenin presides over
a one-party dictatorship, breaks up strikes, bans political parties,
bans Bolshevik factions, and imprisons and shoots political dissidents
these are all regrettable but necessary steps in the protection of the
"proletarian state." When Stalin does the exact same thing, a few years
later, they are all terrible examples of the deformation of this same
"proletarian state"!)

For anarchists (and other libertarian socialists) this was and is
nonsense. Without workers' self-management in production, socialism
cannot exist. To focus attention of whether individuals own property or
whether the state does is fundamentally a red-herring. Without workers'
self-management of production, private capitalism will simply have been
replaced by **state** capitalism. As one anarchist active in the factory
committee movement argued in January, 1918, it is *"not the liberation
of the proletariat when many individual plunders are changed for one
very powerful plunder -- the state. The position of the proletariat
remains the same."* Therefore, *"[w]e must not forget that the factory
committees are the nuclei of the future socialist order"* nor must we
forget *"that the state . . . will try to maintain its own interests at
the expense of the interests of the workers. There is no doubt that we
will be witnesses of a great conflict between the state power in the
centre and the organisations composed exclusively of workers which are
found in the localities."* He was proved right. Instead of centralised
the Bolshevik vision of state capitalism, the anarchists argued that
factory committees *"be united on the basic of federalism, into
industrial federations . . . [and] poly-industrial soviets of national
economy."* Only in that way could **real** socialism be created. [quoted
by Frederick I. Kaplan, **Bolshevik Ideology and the Ethics of Soviet
Labour**, p. 163 and p. 166] (see [section 7](append41.html#app7) of the
appendix ["What happened during the Russian Revolution?"](append41.html)
for more on the factory committee movement).

The reason is obvious. It is worth quoting Cornelius Castoriadis at
length on why the Bolshevik system was doomed to failure:

> *"So we end up with the uncontested power of managers in the
> factories, and the Party's exclusive 'control' (in reality, what kind

Therefore, we *"may therefore conclude that, contrary to the prevailing
mythology, it was not in 1927, or in 1923, or even in 1921 that the game
was played and lost, but much earlier, during the period from 1918 to
1920. . . . [1921 saw] the beginning of the reconstruction of the
productive apparatus. This reconstruction effort, however, was already
firmly set in the groove of bureaucratic capitalism."* [**Op. Cit.**, p.
99] In this, they simply followed the economic ideas Lenin had expounded
in 1917 and 1918, but in an even more undemocratic way. Modern-day
Leninism basically takes the revolutionised Russia of the Bolsheviks
and, essentially, imposes upon it a more democratic form of government
rather than Lenin's (and then Stalin's). Anarchists, however, still
oppose the economy.

Ironically, proof that libertarians are right on this issue can be found
in Trotsky's own work. In 1936, he argued that the *"demobilisation of
the Red Army of five million played no small role in the formation of
the bureaucracy. The victorious commanders assumed leading posts in the
local Soviets, in economy, in education, and they persistently
introduced everywhere that regime which had ensured success in the civil
war. Thus on all sides the masses were pushed away gradually from actual
participation in the leadership of the country."* [**The Revolution
Betrayed**] Needless to say, he failed to note who had abolished the
election of commanders in the Red Army in March 1918, namely himself
(see [section 4](append44.html#app4)). Similarly, he failed to note that
the *"masses"* had been *"pushed . . . from actual participation in the
leadership of the country"* well before the end of the civil war and
that, at the time, he was not concerned about it. Equally, it would be
churlish to note that back in 1920 he thought that *"'Military'
qualities . . . are valued in every sphere. It was in this sense that I
said that every class prefers to have in its service those of its
members who, other things being equal, have passed through the military
school . . . This experience is a great and valuable experience. And
when a former regimental commissary returns to his trade union, he
becomes not a bad organiser."* [**Terrorism and Communism**, p. 173]

In 1937 Trotsky asserted that *"liberal-anarchist thought closes its
eyes to the fact that the Bolshevik revolution, with all its
repressions, meant an upheaval of social relations in the interests of
the masses, whereas Stalin's Thermidorian upheaval accompanies the
reconstruction of Soviet society in the interest of a privileged
minority."* [Trotsky, **Stalinism and Bolshevism**] Yet Stalin's
*"upheaval"* was built upon the social relations created when Lenin and
Trotsky held power. State ownership, one-man management, and so on where
originally advocated and implemented by Lenin and Trotsky. The
bureaucracy did not have to expropriate the working class economically
-- "real" Bolshevism had already did so. Nor can it be said that the
social relations associated with the political sphere had fundamentally
changed under Stalin. He had, after all, inherited the one-party state
from Lenin and Trotsky. In a nutshell, Trotsky is talking nonsense.

Simply put, as Trotsky himself indicates, Bolshevik preference for
nationalisation helped ensure the creation and subsequent rise of the
Stalinist bureaucracy. Rather than be the product of terrible objective
circumstances as his followers suggest, the Bolshevik state capitalist
economic system was at the heart of their vision of what socialism was.
The civil war simply brought the underlying logic of vision into the
fore.

7 How did Bolshevik preference for centralism affect the revolution?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The next issue we will discuss is centralisation. Before starting, it is
essential that it be stressed that anarchists are **not** against
co-ordinated activity and organisation on a large scale. Anarchists
stress the need for federalism to meet the need for such work (see
[section A.2.9](secA2.html#seca29), for example). As such, our critique
of Bolshevik centralism is **not** a call for "localism" or isolation
(as many Leninists assert). Rather, it is a critique of **how** the
social co-operation essential for society will be conducted. Will it be
in a federal (and so bottom-up) way or will it be in a centralised (and
so top-down) way?

It goes almost without saying that Bolshevik ideology was centralist in
nature. Lenin repeatedly stressed the importance of centralisation,
arguing constantly that Marxism was, by its very nature, centralist (and
top-down -- [section H.3.3](secH3.html#sech33)). Long before the
revolution, Lenin had argued that within the party it was a case of
*"the transformation of the power of ideas into the power of authority,
the subordination of lower Party bodies to higher ones."* [**Collected
Works**, vol. 7, p. 367] Such visions of centralised organisation were
the model for the revolutionary state. In 1917, he repeatedly stressed
that after it the Bolsheviks would be totally in favour of
*"centralism"* and *"strong state power."* [Lenin, **Selected Works**,
vol. 2, p. 374] Once in power, they did not disappoint.

Anarchists argue that this prejudice in favour of centralisation and
centralism is at odds with Leninist claims to be in favour of mass
participation. It is all fine and well for Trotskyist Tony Cliff to
quote Lenin arguing that under capitalism the *"talent among the
people"* is *"merely suppressed"* and that it *"must be given an
opportunity to display itself"* and that this can *"save the cause of
socialism,"* it is something else for Lenin (and the Leninist tradition)
to favour organisational structures that allow that to happen.
Similarly, it is fine to record Lenin asserting that *"living, creative
socialism is the product of the masses themselves"* but it is something
else to justify the barriers Leninist ideology placed in the way of it
by its advocacy of centralism. [quoted by Tony Cliff, **Lenin**, vol. 3,
p. 20 and p. 21]

The central contradiction of Leninism is that while it (sometimes) talks
about mass participation, it has always prefers an organisational form
(centralism) which hinders, and ultimately destroys, the participation
that **real** socialism needs.

That centralism works in this way should come as no surprise. After all,
it based on centralising power at the top of an organisation and,
consequently, into a few hands. It was for this precise reason that
**every** ruling class in history has utilised centralisation against
the masses. As we indicated in [section B.2.5](secB2.html#secb25),
centralisation has always been the tool of minority classes to
disempower the masses. In the American and French revolutions,
centralisation of state power was the means used to destroy the
revolution, to take it out off the hands of the masses and concentrate
it into the hands of a minority. In France:

> *"From the moment the bourgeoisie set themselves against the popular
> stream they were in need of a weapon that could enable them to resist
> pressure from the bras nus [working people]; they forced one by
> strengthening the central power . . . [This was] the formation of the
> state machinery through which the bourgeoisie was going to enslave the
> proletariat. Here is the centralised state, with its bureaucracy and
> police . . . [it was] a conscious attempt to reduce . . . the power of
> the people."* [Daniel Guerin, **Class Struggle in the First French
> Republic**, p. 176]

The reason is not hard to understand -- mass participation and class
society do not go together. Thus, *"the move towards bourgeois
dictatorship"* saw *"the strengthening of the central power against the
masses."* [Guerin, **Op. Cit.**, pp. 177-8] *"To attack the central
power,"* argued Kropotkin, *"to strip it of its prerogatives, to
decentralise, to dissolve authority, would have been to abandon to the
people the control of its affairs, to run the risk of a truly popular
revolution. That is why the bourgeoisie sought to reinforce the central
government even more."* [**Words of a Rebel**, p. 143]

Can we expect a similar concentration of the central power under the
Bolsheviks to have a different impact? And, as discussed in appendix
["What happened during the Russian Revolution?"](append41.html) we find
a similar marginalisation of the working class from its own revolution.
Rather than being actively participating in the transformation of
society, they were transformed into spectators who simply were expected
to implement the decisions made by the Bolsheviks on their behalf.
Bolshevik centralisation quickly ensured the disempowerment of working
class people. Unsurprisingly enough, given its role in class society and
in bourgeois revolutions.

In this section of the FAQ, we will indicate why this process happened,
why Bolshevik centralisation undermined the socialist content of the
revolution in favour of new forms of oppression and exploitation.

Therefore, anarchists argue, centralism cannot help but generate
minority rule, not a classless society. Representative, and so
centralised, democracy, argued Malatesta, *"substitutes the will of a
few for that of all . . . and in the name of a fictitious collective
interest, rides roughshod over every real interests, and by means of
elections and the vote, disregards the wishes of each and everyone."*
[**Life and Ideas**, p. 147]

This is rooted in the nature of the system, for democracy does not mean,
in practice, *"rule by all the people."* Rather, as Malatesta pointed
out, it *"would be closer to the truth to say 'government of the
majority of the people."* And even this is false, as *"it is never the
case that the representatives of the majority of the people are in the
same mind on all questions; it is therefore necessary to have recourse
again to the majority system and thus we will get closer still to the
truth with 'government of the majority of the elected by the majority of
the electors.'"* This, obviously, *"is already beginning to bear a
strong resemblance to minority government."* And so, *"it is easy to
understand what has already been proven by universal historical
experience: even in the most democratic of democracies it is always a
small minority that rules and imposes its will and interests by force."*
And so centralism turns democracy into little more than picking masters.
Therefore, anarchists argue, *"those who really want 'government of the
people' . . . must abolish government."* [**The Anarchist Revolution**,
p. 78]

The Russian Revolution is a striking confirmation of this libertarian
analysis. By applying centralism, the Bolsheviks disempowered the masses
and concentrated power into the hands of the party leadership. This
places power in a distinct social class and subject to the pervasive
effects of their concrete social circumstances within their
institutional position. As Bakunin predicted with amazing accuracy:

> *"The falsehood of the representative system rests upon the fiction
> that the executive power and the legislative chamber issuing from

> Political Philosophy of Bakunun**, p. 218]

However, due to the inefficiencies of centralised bodies, this is not
the end of the process. Around the new ruling bodies inevitably springs
up officialdom. This is because a centralised body does not know what is
happening in the grassroots. Therefore it needs a bureaucracy to gather
and process that information and to implement its decisions. In the
words of Bakunin:

> *"where is the head, however brilliant it may be, or if one wishes to
> speak of a collective dictatorship, were it formed of many hundreds of
> individuals endowed with superior faculties, where are those brains
> powerful enough and wide-ranging enough to embrace the infinite

> people, having nothing in common with the mass of people . . . [and
> would] exploit the people and subject them."* [**Michael Bakunin:
> Selected Writings**, pp. 204-6]

As the bureaucracy is permanent and controls information and resources,
it soon becomes the main source of power in the state. The
transformation of the bureaucracy from servant to the master soon
results. The "official" government is soon controlled by it, shaping its
activities in line with its interests. Being highly centralised, popular
control is even more limited than government control -- people would
simply not know where real power lay, which officials to replace or even
what was going on within the distant bureaucracy. Moreover, if the
people did manage to replace the correct people, the newcomers would be
subject to the same institutional pressures that corrupted the previous
members and so the process would start again (assuming their did not
come under the immediate influence of those who remained in the
bureaucracy). Consequently, a new bureaucratic class develops around the
centralised bodies created by the governing party. This body would soon
become riddled with personal influences and favours, so ensuring that
members could be sheltered from popular control. As Malatesta argued,
they *"would use every means available to those in power to have their
friends elected as the successors who would then in turn support and
protect them. And thus government would be passes to and fro in the same
hands, and **democracy,** which is the alleged government of all, would
end up, as usual, in an **oligarchy,** which is the government of a few,
the government of a class."* [**Anarchy**, p. 34]

This state bureaucracy, of course, need not be dictatorial nor the
regime it rules/administers be totalitarian (for example, bourgeois
states combine bureaucracy with many real and important liberties).
However, such a regime is still a class one and socialism would still
not exist -- as proven by the state bureaucracies and nationalised
property within bourgeois society.

So the danger to liberty of combining political **and** economic power
into one set of hands (the state's) is obvious. As Kropotkin argued:

> *"the state was, and continues to be, the chief instrument for
> permitting the few to monopolise the land, and the capitalists to
> appropriate for themselves a quite disproportionate share of the

> Revolutionary Pamphlets**, p. 286]

Thus we have the basic argument **why** centralism will result in the
continuation of class society. Does the Bolshevik experience contradict
this analysis? Essentially, it confirms to Kropotkin's predictions on
the uselessness of "revolutionary" government:

> *"Instead of acting for themselves, instead of marching forward,
> instead of advancing in the direction of the new order of things, the

By the spring and summer of 1918, the Bolshevik party had consolidated
its power. It had created a new state, marked as all states are by the
concentration of power in a few hands and bureaucracy. Effective power
became concentrated into the hands of the executive committees of the
soviets from top to bottom. Faced with rejection at soviet election
after soviet election, the Bolsheviks simply disbanded them and
gerrymandered the rest. At the summit of the new state, a similar
process was at work. The soviets had little real power, which was
centralised in Lenin's new government. This is discussed in more detail
in [section 6](append41.html#app6) of the appendix ["What happened
during the Russian Revolution?"](append41.html). Thus centralisation
quickly displaced popular power and participation. As predicted by
Russia anarchists in November 1917:

> *"Once their power is consolidated and 'legalised', the Bolsheviks --
> who are Social Democrats, that is, men of centralist and authoritarian
> action -- will begin to rearrange the life of the country and of the
> people by governmental and dictatorial methods, imposed by the centre.
> The[y] . . . will dictate the will of the party to all Russia, and
> command the whole nation. Your Soviets and your other local
> organisations will become little by little, simply executive organs of
> the will of the central government. In the place of healthy,
> constructive work by the labouring masses, in place of free
> unification from the bottom, we will see the installation of an
> authoritarian and statist apparatus which would act from above and set
> about wiping out everything that stood in its way with an iron hand.
> The Soviets and other organisations will have to obey and do its will.
> That will be called 'discipline.'"* [quoted by Voline, **The Unknown
> Revolution**, p. 235]

From top to bottom, the new party in power systematically undermined the
influence and power of the soviets they claimed to be ensuring the power
of. This process had begun, it should be stressed **before** the start
of the civil war in May, 1918. Thus Leninist Tony Cliff is wrong to
state that it was *"under the iron pressure of the civil war"* which
forced the Bolshevik leaders *"to move, as the price of survival, to a
**one-party system.**"* [**Revolution Besieged**, p. 163] From the
summer of 1918 (i.e. before the civil war even started), the Bolsheviks
had turned from the first of Kropotkin's "revolutionary" governments
(representative government) to the other, dictatorship, with sadly
predictable results.

So far, the anarchist predictions on the nature of centralised
revolutionary governments had been confirmed. Being placed in a new
social position and, therefore, different social relationships, produced
a dramatic revision on the perspectives of the Bolsheviks. They went
from being in favour of party power to being in favour of party
dictatorship. They acted to ensure their power by making accountability
and recall difficult, if not impossible, and simply ignored any election
results which did not favour them.

What of the second prediction of anarchism, namely that centralisation
will recreate bureaucracy? That, too, was confirmed. After all, some
means were required to gather, collate and provide information by which
the central bodies made their decisions. Thus a necessary side-effect of
Bolshevik centralism was bureaucracy, which, as is well known,
ultimately fused with the party and replaced Leninism with Stalinism.
The rise of a state bureaucracy started immediately with the seizure of
power by the Bolsheviks. Instead of the state starting to *"wither
away"* from the start it grew:

> *"The old state's political apparatus was 'smashed,' but in its place
> a new bureaucratic and centralised system emerged with extraordinary
> rapidity. After the transfer of government to Moscow in March 1918 it

> this was nowhere more true than in the new organisations that
> regulated the economic life of the country."* [Richard Sakwa, *"The
> Commune State in Moscow in 1918,"* pp. 429-449, **Slavic Review**,
> vol. 46, no. 3/4, pp. 437-8]

The *"bureaucracy grew by leaps and bounds. Control over the new
bureaucracy constantly diminished, partly because no genuine opposition
existed. The alienation between 'people' and 'officials,' which the
soviet system was supposed to remove, was back again. Beginning in 1918,
complaints about 'bureaucratic excesses,' lack of contact with voters,
and new proletarian bureaucrats grew louder and louder."* [Oskar
Anweiler, **The Soviets**, p. 242]

Overtime, this permanent collection of bodies would become the real
power in the state, with the party members nominally in charge really
under the control of an unelected and uncontrolled officialdom. This was
recognised by Lenin in the last years of his life. As he noted in 1922:

> *"Let us look at Moscow . . . Who is leading whom? The 4,700
> responsible Communists the mass of bureaucrats, or the other way
> round? I do not believe that you can say that the Communists are
> leading this mass. To put it honestly, they are not the leaders, but
> the led."* [quoted by Chris Harman, **Bureaucracy and Revolution in
> Eastern Europe**, p. 13]

By the end of 1920, there were five times more state officials than
industrial workers. 5, 880,000 were members of the state bureaucracy.
However, the bureaucracy had existed since the start. As noted above,
the 231,000 people employed in offices in in Moscow in August 1918
represented 30 per cent of the workforce there. *"By 1920 the general
number of office workers . . . still represented about a third of those
employed in the city."* In November, 1920, they were 200 000 office
workers in Moscow, compared to 231 000 in August, 1918. By July, 1921
(in spite of a plan to transfer 10,000 away) their numbers had increased
to 228,000 and by October 1922, to 243,000. [Richard Sakwa, **Soviet
Communists in Power**, p. 192, p. 191 and p. 193]

This makes perfect sense as *"on coming to power the Bolsheviks smashed
the old state but rapidly created their own apparatus to wage the
political and economic offensive against the bourgeois and capitalism.
As the functions of the state expanded, so did the bureaucracy . . .
following the revolution the process of institutional proliferation
reached unprecedented heights."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 191] And with
bureaucracy came the abuse of it simply because it held **real** power:

> *"The prevalence of bureaucracy, of committees and commissions . . .
> permitted, and indeed encouraged, endless permutations of corrupt
> practices. These raged from the style of living of communist
> functionaries to bribe-taking by officials. With the power of
> allocation of scare resources, such as housing, there was an
> inordinate potential for corruption."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 193]

The growth in **power** of the bureaucracy should not, therefore, come
as a major surprise given that had existed from the start in sizeable
numbers. However, for the Bolsheviks *"the development of a
bureaucracy"* was a puzzle, *"whose emergence and properties mystified
them."* However, it should be noted that, *"[f]or the Bolsheviks,
bureaucratism signified the escape of this bureaucracy from the will of
the party as it took on a life of its own."* [Sakwa, **Op. Cit.**, p.
182 and p. 190] This was the key. They did not object the usurpation of
power by the party (indeed they placed party dictatorship at the core of
their politics and universalised it to a general principle for **all**
*"socialist"* revolutions). Nor did they object to the centralisation of
power and activity (and so the bureaucratisation of life). They only
objected to it when the bureaucracy was not doing what the party wanted
it to. Indeed, this was the basic argument of Trotsky against Stalinism
(see [section 3](append45.html#app3) of the appendix on ["Were any of
the Bolshevik oppositions a real alternative?"](append45.html)).

Faced with this bureaucracy, the Bolsheviks tried to combat it
(unsuccessfully) and explain it. As the failed to achieve the latter,
they failed in the former. Given the Bolshevik fixation for all things
centralised, they simply added to the problem rather than solve it. Thus
we find that *"[o]n the eve of the VIII Party Congress Lenin had argued
that centralisation was the only way to combat bureaucratism."* [Sakwa,
**Op. Cit.**, p. 196]

Unsurprisingly, Lenin's "anti-bureaucratic" policies in the last years
of his live were *"organisational ones. He purposes the formation of the
Workers' and Peasants' Inspection to correct bureaucratic deformations
in the party and state -- and this body falls under Stalin's control and
becomes highly bureaucratic in its own right. Lenin then suggests that
the size of the Workers' and Peasants' Inspection be reduced and that it
be merged with the Control Commission. He advocates enlarging the
Central Committee. Thus it rolls along; this body to be enlarged, this
one to be merged with another, still a third to be modified or
abolished. The strange ballet of organisational forms continues up to
his very death, as though the problem could be resolved by
organisational means."* [Murray Bookchin, **Post-Scarcity Anarchism**,
p. 205]

Failing to understand the links between centralism and bureaucracy,
Lenin had to find another source for the bureaucracy. He found one. He
*"argued that the low cultural level of the working class prevented mass
involvement in management and this led to bureaucratism . . . the new
state could only reply on a minuscule layer of workers while the rest
were backward because of the low cultural level of the country."*
However, such an explanation is by no means convincing: *"Such
culturalist assertions, which could neither be proved or disproved but
which were politically highly effective in explaining the gulf, served
to blur the political and structural causes of the problem. The working
class was thus held responsible for the failings of the bureaucracy. At
the end of the civil war the theme of the backwardness of the
proletariat was given greater elaboration in Lenin's theory of the
declassing of the proletariat."* [Sakwa, **Op. Cit.**, p. 195] Given
that the bureaucracy had existed from the start, it is hard to say that
a more *"cultured"* working class would have been in a better position
to control the officials of a highly centralised state bureaucracy.
Given the problems workers in "developed" nations have in controlling
their (centralised) union bureaucracies, Lenin's explanation seems
simply inadequate and, ultimately, self-serving.

Nor was this centralism particularly efficient. You need only read
Goldman's or Berkman's accounts of their time in Bolshevik Russia to see
how inefficient and wasteful centralisation and its resultant
bureaucracy was in practice (see **My Disillusionment in Russia** and
**The Bolshevik Myth**, respectively). This can be traced, in part, to
the centralised economic structures favoured by the Bolsheviks.
Rejecting the alternative vision of socialism advocated and, in part
created, by the factory committees (and supported wholeheartedly by the
Russian Anarchists at the time), the Bolsheviks basically took over and
used the *"state capitalist"* organs created under Tsarism as the basis
of their "socialism" (see [section 5](append44.html#app5)). As Lenin
promised **before** seizing power:

> *"**Forced syndicatisation** -- that is, forced fusion into unions
> [i.e. trusts] under the control of the State -- this is what
> capitalism has prepared for us -- this is what the Banker State has
> realised in Germany -- this is what will be completely realisable in
> Russia by the Soviets, by the dictatorship of the proletariat."*
> [**Will the Bolsheviks Maintain Power?**, p. 53]

In practice, Lenin's centralised vision soon proved to be a disaster
(see [section 11](append41.html#app11) of the appendix ["What happened
during the Russian Revolution?"](append41.html) for details). It was
highly inefficient and simply spawned a vast bureaucracy. There was an
alternative, as we discuss in [section 12](append41.html#app12) of the
appendix ["What happened during the Russian
Revolution?"](append41.html), the only reason that industry did not
totally collapse in Russia during the early months of the revolution was
the activity of the factory committees. However, such activity was not
part of the Bolshevik vision of centralised socialism and so the factory
committees were **not** encouraged. At the very moment when mass
participation and initiative is required (i.e. during a revolution) the
Bolsheviks favoured a system which killed it. As Kropotkin argued a few
years later:

> *"production and exchange represented an undertaking so complicated
> that the plans of the state socialists, which lead to a party
> directorship, would prove to be absolutely ineffective as soon as they
> were applied to life. No government would be able to organise
> production if the workers themselves through their unions did not do
> it in each branch of industry; for in all production there arise daily
> thousands of difficulties which no government can solve or foresee . .
> . Only the efforts of thousands of intelligences working on the
> problems can co-operate in the development of a new social system and
> find the best solutions for the thousands of local needs."*
> [**Kropotkin's Revolutionary Pamphlets**, pp. 76-7]

No system is perfect. Any system will take time to develop fully. Of
course the factory committees made mistakes and, sometimes, things were
pretty chaotic with different factories competing for scarce resources.
But that does not prove that factory committees and their federations
were not the most efficient way of running things under the
circumstances. Unless, of course, you share the Bolsheviks a dogmatic
belief that central planning is always more efficient. Moreover, attacks
on the factory committees for lack of co-ordination by pro-Leninists
seem less than sincere, given the utter lack of encouragement (and,
often, actual barriers) the Bolsheviks placed in the way of the creation
of federations of factory committees (see [section
9](append41.html#app9) of the appendix ["What happened during the
Russian Revolution?"](append41.html) for further details).

Lastly, Bolshevik centralism (as well as being extremely inefficient)
also ensured that the control of production and the subsequent surplus
would be in the hands of the state and, so, class society would
continue. In Russia, capitalism became state capitalism under Lenin and
Trotsky (see sections [5](append44.html#app5) and
[6](append44.html#app6) for more discussion of this).

So Bolshevik support for centralised power ensured that minority power
replaced popular power, which, in turn, necessitated bureaucracy to
maintain it. Bolshevism retained statist and capitalist social relations
and, as such, could not develop socialist ones which, by their very
nature, imply egalitarianism in terms of social influence and power
(i.e. the abolition of concentrated power, both economic and political).
Ironically, by being centralists, the Bolsheviks systematically
eliminated mass participation and ensured the replacement of popular
power with party power. This saw the rebirth of non-socialist social
relationships within society, so ensuring the defeat of the socialist
tendencies and institutions which had started to grow during 1917.

It cannot be said that this centralism was a product of the civil war.
As best it could be argued that the civil war extenuated an existing
centralist spirit into ultra-centralism, but it did not create it. After
all, Lenin was stressing that the Bolsheviks were *"convinced
centralists . . . by their programme and the tactics of the whole of
their party"* in 1917. Ironically, he never realised (nor much cared,
after the seizure of power) that this position precluded his call for
*"the deepening and extension of democracy in the administration of a
State of the of the proletarian type."* [**Can the Bolsheviks Maintain
Power?**, p. 74 and p. 55] Given that centralism exists to ensure
minority rule, we should not be to surprised that party power replaced
popular participation and self-government quickly after the October
Revolution. Which it did. Writing in September 1918, a Russian anarchist
portrays the results of Bolshevik ideology in practice:

> *"Within the framework of this dictatorship [of the proletariat] . . .
> we can see that the centralisation of power has begun to crystallise
> and grow firm, that the apparatus of the state is being consolidated
> by the ownership of property and even by an anti-socialist morality.
> Instead of hundreds of thousands of property owners there is now a
> single owner served by a whole bureaucratic system and a new
> 'statised' morality.*
>
> "The proletariat is gradually being enserfed by the state. The people
> are being transformed into servants over whom there has risen a new
> class of administrators -- a new class . . . Isn't this merely a new
> class system looming on the revolutionary horizon . . .
>
> "The resemblance is all too striking . . . And if the elements of
> class inequality are as yet indistinct, it is only a matter of time
> before privileges will pass to the administrators. We do not mean to
> say . . . that the Bolshevik party set out to create a new class
> system. But we do say that even the best intentions and aspirations

> Sergven, cited by Paul Avrich, **Anarchists in the Russian
> Revolution**, pp. 123-5]

Subsequent developments proved this argument correct. Working class
revolts were crushed by the state and a new class society developed.
little wonder, then, Alexander Berkman's summary of what he saw first
hand in Bolshevik Russia a few years later:

> *"Mechanical centralisation, run mad, is paralysing the industrial and
> economic activities of the country. Initiative is frowned upon, free
> effort systematically discouraged. The great masses are deprived of
> the opportunity to shape the policies of the Revolution, or take part
> in the administration of the affairs of the country. The government is
> monopolising every avenue of life; the Revolution is divorced from the
> people. A bureaucratic machine is created that is appalling in its
> parasitism, inefficiency and corruption. In Moscow alone this new
> class of **sovburs** (Soviet bureaucrats) exceeds, in 1920, the total
> of office holders throughout the whole of Russia under the Tsar in
> 1914 . . . The Bolshevik economic policies, effectively aided by this
> bureaucracy, completely disorganise the already crippled industrial
> life of the country. Lenin, Zinoviev, and other Communist leaders
> thunder philippics against the new Soviet bourgeoisie, - and issue
> ever new decrees that strengthen and augment its numbers and
> influence."* [**The Russian Tragedy**, p. 26]

Bakunin would not have been remotely surprised. As such, the Bolshevik
revolution provided a good example to support Malatesta's argument that
*"if . . . one means government action when one talks of social action,
then this is still the resultant of individual forces, but only of those
individuals who form the government . . . it follows. . . that far from
resulting in an increase in the productive, organising and protective
forces in society, it would greatly reduce them, limiting initiative to
a few, and giving them the right to do everything without, of course,
being able to provide them with the gift of being all-knowing."*
[**Anarchy**, pp. 36-7]

By confusing *"state action"* with collective working class action, the
Bolsheviks effectively eliminated the latter in favour of the former.
The usurpation of all aspects of life by the centralised bodies created
by the Bolsheviks left workers with no choice but to act as isolated
individuals. Can it be surprising, then, that Bolshevik policies aided
the atomisation of the working class by replacing collective
organisation and action by state bureaucracy? The potential for
collective action **was** there. You need only look at the strikes and
protests directed **against** the Bolsheviks to see that was the case
(see [section 5](append43.html#app5) of the appendix on ["What caused
the degeneration of the Russian Revolution?"](append43.html) for
details). Ironically, Bolshevik policies and ideology ensured that the
collective effort and action of workers was directed not at solving the
revolution's problems but resisting Bolshevik tyranny.

That centralism concentrates power in a few hands can be seen even in
Leninist accounts of the Russian revolution. To take one example, Tony
Cliff may assert that the *"mistakes of the masses were themselves
creative"* but when push comes to shove, he (like Lenin) simply does not
allow the masses to make such mistakes and, consequently, learn from
them. Thus he defends Lenin's economic policies of *"state capitalism"*
and *"one-man management"* (and in the process misleadingly suggests
that these were **new** ideas on Lenin's part, imposed by objective
factors, rather than, as Lenin acknowledged, what he had advocated all
along -- see [section 5](append44.html#app5)). Thus we discover that the
collapse of industry (which had started in the start of 1917) meant that
*"[d]rastic measures had to be taken."* But never fear, *"Lenin was not
one to shirk responsibility, however unpleasant the task."* He called
for *"state capitalism,"* and there *"were more difficult decisions to
be accepted. To save industry from complete collapse, Lenin argued for
the need to impose one-man management."* So much for the creative
self-activity of the masses, which was quickly dumped -- precisely at
the time when it was most desperately needed. And it is nice to know
that in a workers' state it is not the workers who decide things. Rather
it is Lenin (or his modern equivalent, like Cliff) who would have the
task of not shirking from the responsibility of deciding which drastic
measures are required. [**Op. Cit.**, p. 21, p. 71 and p. 73] So much
for "workers' power"!

Ultimately, centralism is designed to exclude the mass participation
anarchists have long argued is required by a social revolution. It
helped to undermine what Kropotkin considered the key to the success of
a social revolution -- *"the people becom[ing] masters of their
destiny."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 133] In his words:

> *"We understand the revolution as a widespread popular movement,
> during which in every town and village within the region of revolt,
> the masses will have to take it upon themselves **the work of
> construction upon communistic bases,** without awaiting any orders and
> directions from above . . . As to representative government, whether
> self-appointed or elected . . . , we place in it no hopes whatever. We
> know beforehand that it will be able to do nothing to accomplish the
> revolution as long as the people themselves do not accomplish the
> change by working out on the spot the necessary new institutions . . .
> nowhere and never in history do we find that people carried into
> government by a revolutionary wave, have proved equal to the
> occasion.*
> "In the task of reconstructing society on new principles, separate men
> . . . are sure to fail. The collective spirit of the masses is
> necessary for this purpose . . . a socialist government . . . would be
> absolutely powerless without the activity of the people themselves,
> and that, necessarily, they would soon begin to act fatally as a
> bridle upon the revolution." [**Op. Cit.**, pp. 188-190]

The Bolshevik revolution and its mania for centralism proved him right.
The use of centralisation helped ensure that workers' lost any
meaningful say in their revolution and helped alienate them from it.
Instead of the mass participation of all, the Bolsheviks ensured the
top-down rule of a few. Unsurprisingly, as mass participation is what
centralism was designed to exclude. Wishful thinking on behalf of the
Bolshevik leaders (and their later-day followers) could not (and can
not) overcome the structural imperatives of centralisation and its role
in society. Nor could it stop the creation of a bureaucracy around these
new centralised institutions.

8 How did the aim for party power undermine the revolution?
-----------------------------------------------------------

As well as a passion for centralisation and state capitalism, Bolshevism
had another aim which helped undermine the revolution. This was the goal
of party power (see see [section 5](append41.html#app5) of the appendix
["What happened during the Russian Revolution?"](append41.html) for
details). Given this, namely that the Bolsheviks had, from the start,
aimed for party power it should not come as too surprising that
Bolshevik dictatorship quickly replaced soviet democracy.

Given this obvious fact, it seems strange for modern day Leninists to
blame the civil war for the Bolsheviks substituting their rule for the
masses. After all, when strange for modern day Leninists to blame the
civil war for the Bolsheviks substituting their rule for the masses.
After all, when the Bolshevik Party took power in October 1917, it did
"substitute" itself for the working class and did so deliberately and
knowingly. As we note in [section 2](append44.html#app2), this
usurpation of power by a minority was perfectly acceptable within the
Marxist theory of the state, a theory which aided this process no end.

Thus the Bolshevik party would be in power, with the *"conscious
workers"* ruling over the rest. The question instantly arises of what
happens if the masses turn against the party. If the Bolsheviks embody
*"the power of the proletariat,"* what happens if the proletariat reject
the party? The undermining of soviet power by party power and the
destruction of soviet democracy in the spring and summer of 1918 answers
that specific question (see [section 6](append41.html#app6) of the
appendix ["What happened during the Russian
Revolution?"](append41.html)). This should have come as no surprise,
given the stated aim (and implementation) of party power plus the
Bolshevik identification of party power with workers' power. It is not a
great step to party dictatorship **over** the proletariat from these
premises (particularly if we include the underlying assumptions of
vanguardism -- see [section H.5.3](secH5.html#sech53)). A step, we must
stress, that the Bolsheviks quickly took when faced with working class
rejection in the soviet elections of spring and summer of 1918.

Nor was this destruction of soviet democracy by party power just the
result of specific conditions in 1917-8. This perspective had been in
Russian Marxist circles well before the revolution. As we discuss in
[section H.5](secH5.html), vanguardism implies party power (see, as
noted, [section H.5.3](secH5.html#sech53) in particular). The ideas of
Lenin's **What is to be Done?** give the ideological justification for
party dictatorship over the masses. Once in power, the logic of
vanguardism came into its own, allowing the most disgraceful repression
of working class freedoms to be justified in terms of "Soviet Power" and
other euphemisms for the party.

The identification of workers' power with party power has deeply
undemocratic results, as the experience of the Bolshevik proves.
However, these results were actually articulated in Russian socialist
circles before hand. At the divisive 1903 congress of the Russian Social
Democrats, which saw the split into two factions (Bolshevik and
Menshevism) Plekhanov, the father of Russian Marxism, argued as follows:

> *"Every particular democratic principle must be considered not in
> itself, abstractly, . . . the success of the revolution is the highest
> law. And if, for the success of the revolution's success, we need
> temporarily to restrict the functioning of a particular democratic
> principle, then it would be criminal to refrain from imposing that
> restriction. . . And we must take the same attitude where the question
> of the length of parliaments is concerned. If, in an outburst of
> revolutionary enthusiasm, the people elect a very good parliament . .
> . it would suit us to try and make that a **long Parliament**; but if
> the elections turned out badly for us, we should have to try and
> disperse the resulting parliament not after two years but, if
> possible, after two weeks."* [RSDLP, **Minutes of the Second Congress
> of the RSDLP**, p. 220]

Another delegate argued that *"[t]here is not a single one among the
principles of democracy which we ought not to subordinate **to the
interests of our Party** . . . we must consider democratic principles
exclusively from the standpoint of the most rapid achievement of that
aim [i.e. revolution], from the standpoint of the interests of our
Party. If any particular demand is against our interests, we must not
include it."* To which, Plekhanov replied, *"I fully associate myself
with what Comrade Posadovksy has said."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 219 and p.
220] Lenin *"agreed unreservedly with this subordination of democratic
principles to party interests."* [Oskar Anweiler, **The Soviets**, p.
211]

Plekhanov at this time was linked with Lenin, although this association
lasted less than a year. After that, he became associated with the
Mensheviks (before his support for Russia in World War I saw him form
his own faction). Needless to say, he was mightily annoyed when Lenin
threw his words back in his face in 1918 when the Bolsheviks disbanded
the Constituent Assembly. Yet while Plekhanov came to reject this
position (perhaps because the elections had not *"turned out badly for"*
his liking) it is obvious that the Bolsheviks embraced it and keenly
applied it to elections to soviets and unions as well as Parliaments
once in power (see [section 6](append41.html#app6) of the appendix
["What happened during the Russian Revolution?"](append41.html) for
example). But, at the time, he sided with Lenin against the Mensheviks
and it can be argued that the latter applied these teachings of that
most respected pre-1914 Russian Marxist thinker.

This undemocratic perspective can also be seen when, in 1905, the St.
Petersburg Bolsheviks, like most of the party, opposed the soviets. They
argued that *"only a strong party along class lines can guide the
proletarian political movement and preserve the integrity of its
program, rather than a political mixture of this kind, an indeterminate
and vacillating political organisation such as the workers council
represents and cannot help but represent."* [quoted by Oskar Anweiler,
**The Soviets**, p. 77] Thus the soviets could not reflect workers'
interests because they were elected by the workers!

The Bolsheviks saw the soviets as a rival to their party and demanded it
either accept their political program or simply become a trade-union
like organisation. They feared that it pushed aside the party committee
and thus led to the *"subordination of consciousness to spontaneity"*
and under the label *"non-party"* allow *"the rotten goods of bourgeois
ideology"* to be introduced among the workers. [quoted by Anweilier,
**Op. Cit.**, p. 78 and p. 79] In this, the St. Petersburg Bolsheviks
were simply following Lenin's **What is to be Done?**, in which Lenin
had argued that the *"**spontaneous** development of the labour movement
leads to it being subordinated to bourgeois ideology."* [**Essential
Works of Lenin**, p. 82] Lenin in 1905, to his credit, rejected these
clear conclusions of his own theory and was more supportive of the
soviets than his followers (although *"he sided in principle with those
who saw in the soviet the danger of amorphous nonpartisan
organisation."* [Anweilier, **Op. Cit.**, p. 81]).

This perspective, however, is at the root of all Bolshevik
justifications for party power after the October revolution. The logical
result of this position can be found in the actions of the Bolsheviks in
1918 and onwards. For the Bolsheviks in power, the soviets were less
than important. The key for them was to maintain Bolshevik party power
and if soviet democracy was the price to pay, then they were more than
willing to pay it. As such, Bolshevik attitudes in 1905 are significant:

> *"Despite the failure of the Bolshevik assault on the non-partisanship
> of the [St.] Petersburg Soviet, which may be dismissed as a passing
> episode . . . the attempt . . . is of particular significance in
> understanding the Bolshevik's mentality, political ambitions and
> **modus operandi.** First, starting in [St.] Petersburg, the Bolshevik
> campaign was repeated in a number of provincial soviets such as
> Kostroma and Tver, and, possibly, Sormovo. Second, the assault reveals
> that from the outset the Bolsheviks were distrustful of, if not
> hostile towards the Soviets, to which they had at best an instrumental
> and always party-minded attitude. Finally, the attempt to bring the
> [St.] Petersburg Soviet to heel is an early and major example of
> Bolshevik take-over techniques hitherto practised within the narrow
> confines of the underground party and now extended to the larger arena
> of open mass organisations such as soviets, with the ultimate aim of
> controlling them and turning them into one-party organisations, or,
> failing that, of destroying them."* [Israel Getzler, *"The Bolshevik
> Onslaught on the Non-Party 'Political Profile' of the Petersburg
> Soviet of Workers' Deputies October-November 1905",* **Revolutionary
> History**, pp. 123-146, vol. 5, no. 2, pp. 124-5]

The instrumentalist approach of the Bolsheviks post-1917 can be seen
from their arguments and attitudes in 1905. On the day the Moscow soviet
opened, a congress of the northern committees of the Social Democratic
Party passed a resolution stating that a *"council of workers deputies
should be established only in places where the party organisation has no
other means of directing the proletariat's revolutionary action . . .
The soviet of workers deputies must be a technical instrument of the
party for the purpose of giving political leadership to the masses
through the RSDWP [the Social-Democratic Party]. It is therefore
imperative to gain control of the soviet and prevail upon it to
recognise the program and political leadership of the RSDWP."* [quoted
by Anweilier, **Op. Cit.**, p. 79]

This perspective that the party should be given precedence can be seen
in Lenin's comment that while the Bolsheviks should *"go along with the
unpoliticalised proletarians, but on no account and at no time should we
forget that animosity among the proletariat toward the Social Democrats
is a remnant of bourgeois attitudes . . . Participation in unaffiliated
organisations can be permitted to socialists only as an exception . . .
only if the independence of the workers party is guaranteed and if
within unaffiliated organisations or soviets individual delegates or
party groups are subject to unconditional control and guidance by the
party executive."* [quoted by Anweilier, **Op. Cit.**, p. 81] These
comments have clear links to Lenin's argument in 1920 that working class
protest against the Bolsheviks showed that they had become *"declassed"*
(see [section 5](append43.html#app5) of the appendix on ["What caused
the degeneration of the Russian Revolution?"](append43.html)). It
similarly allows soviets to be disbanded if Bolsheviks are not elected
(which they were, see [section 6](append41.html#app6) of the appendix
["What happened during the Russian Revolution?"](append41.html)). It
also ensures that Bolshevik representatives to the soviets are not
delegates from the workplace, but rather a "transmission belt" (to use a
phrase from the 1920s) for the decisions of the party leadership. In a
nutshell, Bolshevik soviets would represent the party's central
committee, not those who elected them. As Oskar Anweiler summarised:

> *"The 'revolutionary genius' of the people, which Lenin had mentioned
> and which was present in the soviets, constantly harboured the danger
> of 'anarcho-syndicalist tendencies' that Lenin fought against all his
> life. He detected this danger early in the development of the soviets
> and hoped to subdue it by subordinating the soviets to the party. The
> drawback of the new 'soviet democracy' hailed by Lenin in 1906 is that
> he could envisage the soviets only as **controlled** organisations;
> for him they were the instruments by which the party controlled the
> working masses, rather than true forms of a workers democracy."*
> [**Op. Cit.**, p. 85]

As we noted in [section H.3.11](secH3.html#sech311), Lenin had concluded
in 1907 that while the party could *"utilise"* the soviets *"for the
purpose of developing the Social-Democratic movement,"* the party *"must
bear in mind that if Social-Democratic activities among the proletarian
masses are properly, effectively and widely organised, such institutions
may actually become superfluous."* [Marx, Engels and Lenin, **Anarchism
and Anarcho-Syndicalism**, p. 210] Thus the means by which working class
can manage their own affairs would become *"superfluous"* once the party
was in power. As Samuel Farber argues, Lenin's position before 1917 was
*"clearly implying that the party could normally fulfil its
revolutionary role without the existence of broad class organisations .
. . Consequently, Lenin's and the party's eventual endorsement of the
soviets in 1905 seems to have been tactical in character. That is, the
Bolshevik support for the soviets did not at the time signify a
theoretical and/or principled commitment to these institutions as
revolutionary organs to overthrow the old society, let alone as key
structural ingredients of the post-revolutionary order. Furthermore, it
is again revealing that from 1905 to 1917 the concept of soviets did not
play an important role in the thinking of Lenin or of the Bolshevik
Party . . . [T]hese strategies and tactics vis-a-vis the soviets . . .
can be fairly seen as expressing a predisposition favouring the party
and downgrading the soviets and other non-party class organisations, at
least in relative terms."* [**Before Stalinism**, p. 37] Such a
perspective on the soviets can be seen once the party was in power when
they quickly turned them, without concern, into mere fig-leafs for party
power (see [section 6](append41.html#app6) of the appendix ["What
happened during the Russian Revolution?"](append41.html) for more
details).

It cannot be mere coincidence that the ideas and rhetoric against the
soviets in 1905 should resurface again once the Bolsheviks were in
power. For example, in 1905, in St. Petersburg *"the Bolsheviks pressed
on"* with their campaign and, *"according to the testimony of Vladimir
Voitinskii, then a young Bolshevik agitator, the initial thrust of the
Bolshevik 'plan' was to push the SRs [who were in a minority] out of the
Soviet, while 'the final blow' would be directed against the Mensheviks.
Voitinskii also recalled the heated argument advanced by the popular
agitator Nikolai Krylenko ('Abram') for the 'dispersal of the Soviet'
should it reject the 'ultimatum' to declare its affiliation with the
RSDP."* [Getzler, **Op., Cit.**, pp. 127-8] This mirrored events in
1918. Then *"at the local political level"* Bolshevik majorities were
attained (*"by means fair, foul and terrorist"*) *"in the plenary
assemblies of the soviets, and with the barring of all those not
'completely dedicated to Soviet power' [i.e. Mensheviks and SRs] from
the newly established network of soviet administrative departments and
from the soviet militias. Soviets where Bolshevik majorities could not
be achieved were simply disbanded."* A similar process occurred at the
summit (see [section 7](append44.html#app7)). Thus *"the October
revolution marked [the soviets] transformation from agents of
democratisation into regional and local administrative organs of the
centralised, one-party Soviet state."* [Israel Getzler, **Soviets as
Agents of Democratisation**, p. 27 and pp. 26-7]

Can such an outcome really have **no** link at all with the Bolshevik
position and practice in period before 1917 and, in particular, during
the 1905 revolution? Obviously not. As such, we should not be too
surprised or shocked when Lenin replied to a critic who assailed the
"dictatorship of one party" in 1919 by clearly and unashamedly stating:
*"Yes, the dictatorship of one party! We stand upon it and cannot depart
from this ground, since this is the party which in the course of decades
has won for itself the position of vanguard of the whole factory and
industrial proletariat."* [quoted by E.H. Carr, **The Bolshevik
Revolution**, vol. 1, p. 236] Or when he replied to a critic in 1920
that *"[h]e says we understand by the words dictatorship of proletariat
what is actually the dictatorship of its determined and conscious
minority. And that is the fact."* This *"minority . . . may be called a
party,"* Lenin stressed. [quoted by Arthur Ransome, **The Crisis in
Russia 1920**, p. 35]

This perspective can be traced back to the underlying ideology expounded
by the Bolsheviks before and during 1917. For example, mere days after
seizing power in the October Revolution Lenin was stressing that the
Bolsheviks' *"present slogan is: No compromise, i.e. for a homogeneous
Boshevik government."* He did not hesitate to use the threat to *"appeal
to the sailors"* against the other socialist parties, stating *"[i]f you
get the majority, take power in the Central Executive Committee and
carry one. But we will go to the sailors."* [quoted by Tony Cliff,
**Lenin**, vol. 3, p. 26] Clearly soviet power was far from Lenin's
mind, rejecting soviet democracy if need be in favour of party power.
Strangely, Cliff (a supporter of Lenin) states that Lenin *"did not
visualise one-party rule"* and that the *"first decrees and laws issued
after the October revolution were full of repetitions of the word
'democracy.'"* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 161 and p. 146] He goes on to quote
Lenin stating that *"[a]s a democratic government we cannot ignore the
decision of the masses of the people, even though we disagree with it."*
Cliff strangely fails to mention that Lenin also applied this not only
to the land decree (as Cliff notes) but also to the Constituent
Assembly. *"And even if,"* Lenin continued, *"the peasants continue to
follow the Socialist Revolutionaries, even if they give this party a
majority in the Constituent Assembly, we shall still say -- what of
it?"* [Lenin, **Collected Works**, vol. 26, pp. 260-1] But the
Bolsheviks disbanded the Constituent Assembly after one session. The
peasants had voted for the SRs and the Assembly went the same way as
Lenin's promises. And if Lenin's promises of 1917 on the Assembly proved
to be of little value, then why should his various comments to soviet
democracy be considered any different? In a clash between soviet
democracy and party power, the Bolsheviks consistently favoured the
latter.

Thus Bolshevik ideology had consistently favoured party power and had a
long term ideological preference for it. Combine this aim of party power
with a vanguardism position (see [section H.5](secH5.html)) and party
dictatorship will soon result. Neil Harding summarises the issue well:

This authoritarian position, which allows "socialism" to be imposed by
force upon the working class, lies at the core of Leninism. Ironically,
while Bolshevism claims to be **the** party of the working class,
representing it essentially or exclusively, they do so in the name of
possessing a theory that, qua theory, can be the possession of
intellectuals and, therefore, has to be "introduced" to the working
class from outside (see [section H.5.1](secH5.html#sech51) for details).

This means that Bolshevism is rooted in the identification of "class
consciousness" with supporting the party. Given the underlying premises
of vanguardism, unsurprisingly the Bolsheviks took "class consciousness"
to mean this. If the workers protested against the policies of the
party, this represented a fall in class consciousness and, therefore,
working class resistance placed "class" power in danger. If, on the
other hand, the workers remained quiet and followed the party's decision
then, obviously, they showed high levels of class consciousness. The net
effect of this position was, of course, to justify party dictatorship.
Which, of course, the Bolsheviks did create **and** justified
ideologically.

Thus the Bolshevik aim for party power results in disempowering the
working class in practice. Moreover, the assumptions of vanguardism
ensure that only the party leadership is able to judge what is and is
not in the interests of the working class. Any disagreement by elements
of that class or the whole class itself can be dismissed as *"wavering"*
and *"vacillation."* While this is perfectly acceptable within the
Leninist *"from above"* perspective, from an anarchist *"from below"*
perspective it means little more than pseudo-theoretical justification
for party dictatorship **over** the proletariat and the ensuring that a
socialist society will **never** be created. Ultimately, socialism
without freedom is meaningless -- as the Bolshevik regime proved time
and time again.

As such, to claim that the Bolsheviks did not aim to "substitute" party
power for working class power seems inconsistent with both Bolshevik
theory and practice. Lenin had been aiming for party power from the
start, identifying it with working class power. As the party was the
vanguard of the proletariat, it was duty bound to seize power and govern
on behalf of the masses and, moreover, take any actions necessary to
maintain the revolution -- even if these actions violated the basic
principles required to have any form of meaningful workers' democracy
and freedom. Thus the *"dictatorship of the proletariat"* had long
become equated with party power and, once in power, it was only a matter
of time before it became the *"dictatorship of the party."* And once
this did occur, none of the leading Bolsheviks questioned it. The
implications of these Bolshevik perspectives came clear after 1917, when
the Bolsheviks raised the need for party dictatorship to an ideological
truism.

Thus it seems strange to hear some Leninists complain that the rise of
Stalinism can be explained by the rising "independence" of the state
machine from the class (i.e. party) it claimed to in service of.
Needless to say, few Leninists ponder the links between the rising
*"independence"* of the state machine from the proletariat (by which
most, in fact, mean the *"vanguard"* of the proletariat, the party) and
Bolshevik ideology. As noted in [section H.3.8](secH3.html#sech38), a
key development in Bolshevik theory on the state was the perceived need
for the vanguard to ignore the wishes of the class it claimed to
represent and lead. For example, Victor Serge (writing in the 1920s)
considered it a truism that the *"party of the proletariat must know, at
hours of decision, how to break the resistance of the backward elements
among the masses; it must know how to stand firm sometimes against the
masses . . . it must know how to go against the current, and cause
proletarian consciousness to prevail against lack of consciousness and
against alien class influences."* [**Year One of the Russian
Revolution**, p. 218]

The problem with this is that, by definition, **everyone** is backward
in comparison to the vanguard party. Moreover, in Bolshevik ideology it
is the party which determines what is and is not *"proletarian
consciousness."* Thus we have the party ideologue presenting
self-justifications for party power **over** the working class. Now, is
the vanguard is to be able to ignore the masses then it must have power
**over** them. Moreover, to be independent of the masses the machine it
relies on to implement its power must also, by definition, be
independent of the masses. Can we be surprised, therefore, with the rise
of the "independent" state bureaucracy in such circumstances? If the
state machine is to be independent of the masses then why should we
expect it not to become independent of the vanguard? Surely it must be
the case that we would be far more surprised if the state machine did
**not** become "independent" of the ruling party?

Nor can it be said that the Bolsheviks learned from the experience of
the Russian Revolution. This can be seen from Trotsky's 1937 comments
that the *"proletariat can take power only through its vanguard. In
itself the necessity for state power arises from the insufficient
cultural level of the masses and their heterogeneity."* Thus *"state
power"* is required **not** to defend the revolution against reaction
but from the working class itself, who do not have a high enough
*"cultural level"* to govern themselves. At best, their role is that of
a passive supporter, for "[w]ithout the confidence of the class in the
vanguard, without support of the vanguard by the class, there can be no
talk of the conquest of power." While soviets *"are the only organised
form of the tie between the vanguard and the class"* it does not mean
that they are organs of self-management. No, a *"revolutionary content
can be given . . . only by the party. This is proved by the positive
experience of the October Revolution and by the negative experience of
other countries (Germany, Austria, finally, Spain)."* [**Stalinism and
Bolshevism**]

Sadly, Trotsky failed to explicitly address the question of what happens
when the *"masses"* stop having *"confidence in the vanguard"* and
decides to support some other group. After all, if a *"revolutionary
content"* can only be given by *"the party"* then if the masses reject
the party then the soviets can no only be revolutionary. To save the
revolution, it would be necessary to destroy the democracy and power of
the soviets. Which is **exactly** what the Bolsheviks did do in 1918. By
equating popular power with party power Bolshevism not only opens the
door to party dictatorship, it invites it in, gives it some coffee and
asks it to make itself a home! Nor can it be said that Trotsky ever
appreciated Kropotkin's *"general observation"* that *"those who preach
dictatorship do not in general perceive that in sustaining their
prejudice they only prepare the way for those who later on will cut
their throats."* [**Kropotkin's Revolutionary Pamphlets**, p. 244]

In summary, it cannot be a coincidence that once in power the Bolsheviks
acted in ways which had clear links to the political ideology it had
been advocating before hand. As such, the Bolshevik aim for party power
helped undermine the real power of working class people during the
Russian revolution. Rooted in a deeply anti-democratic political
tradition, it was ideologically predisposed to substitute party power
for soviet power and, finally, to create -- and justify -- the
dictatorship **over** the proletariat. The civil war may have shaped
certain aspects of these authoritarian tendencies but it did not create
them.
