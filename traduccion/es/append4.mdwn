Appendix -- The Russian Revolution

This appendix of the FAQ exists to discuss in depth the Russian
revolution and the impact that Leninist ideology and practice had on its
outcome. Given that the only reason why Leninism is taken seriously in
some parts of the revolutionary movement is the Russian Revolution, it
is useful to expose what Alexander Berkman called "the Bolshevik Myth."
This means discussing certain aspects of the revolution and indicating
exactly how Leninism helped destroy any libertarian potential it had. It
also means analysing common, modern-day, Leninist excuses for the
actions of the Bolsheviks to see if they hold water. It also means
analysing in depth specific events of the revolution (such as the
Kronstadt uprising of March 1921 and the libertarian influenced
Makhnovist movement) to see if there was an alternative to Leninism at
the time. Luckily, the answer is yes.

As will become clear from this appendix, Bolshevik actions and ideology
had a decisive impact on the development and degeneration of the
Revolution. With its centralised, top-down statist political vision, its
(openly) state capitalist economic vision and its aim for party power,
Leninism had pushed the revolution in an authoritarian direction before
the Russian Civil War started (the most common Leninist explanation of
what went wrong). Leninism, ironically enough, proved the anarchist
critique of Marxism to be correct. Anarchists are confident that in
depth analysis of the Russian Revolution will confirm the limitations of
Bolshevism as a revolutionary movement and point to libertarian ideas
for anyone who wants to change the world.
