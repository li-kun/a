Reply to errors and distortions in the SWP's *"Marxism and Anarchism"*
======================================================================

In issue no. 1714 of Socialist Worker (dated 16th September 2000) the
British Socialist Workers Party (SWP) decided to expose anarchism in an
article entitled [*"Marxism and
Anarchism."*](http://www.socialistworker.co.uk/1714/sw171411.htm)
However, their article is little more than a series of errors and
distortions. We shall indicate how the SWP lies about anarchist ideas
and discuss the **real** differences between anarchism and Marxism.
Moreover, we will indicate that the bulk of the SWP's article just
recycles common Leninist slanders about anarchism, slanders that have
been refuted many times over.

1. What does the anti-globalisation movement tell us about the effectiveness of the "vanguard" parties like the SWP?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The inspiration for their diatribe is clear -- they are worried about
anarchist influence in the various anti-capitalist and
anti-globalisation movements and demonstrations which are currently
occurring across the world. As they put it:

> *"The great revolt against capitalism in Seattle last year, and
> similar demonstrations since, have attracted diverse groups of
> protesters. Anarchists, amongst others, have taken part in all of
> those protests."*

Yes, indeed, anarchists have been involved in these demonstrations from
the start, unlike "vanguard" parties like the SWP who only became aware
of the significance of these movements once they exploded in the
streets. That in itself should tell us something about the effectiveness
of the Bolshevik inspired politics the SWP raise as an alternative to
anarchism. Rather than being at the vanguard of these demonstrations and
movements, parties like the SWP have been, post-Seattle, busy trying to
catch up with them. Nor is this the only time this has happened.

In Russia, in February 1917, for example, the Bolshevik party opposed
the actions that produced the revolution which overthrew the Tsar. After
weeks of strikes with police attacks on factories, the most oppressed
part of the working class, the women textile workers, took the
initiative. Demands for bread and attacks on bakeries were superseded by
a massive demonstration of women workers on International Women's Day.
The women had ignored a local Bolshevik directive to wait until May Day!
The early slogan of *"Bread!"* was quickly followed by *"Down with the
autocracy! Down with the war!"* By February 24th, half of Petrograd was
on strike. The workers did go to their factories, not to work, but to
hold meetings, pass resolutions and then go out to demonstrate. The
Vyborg committee of the Bolsheviks opposed the strikes. Luckily for the
Russian workers, and unfortunately for the Tsar, the Bolsheviks were
ignored. If they had followed the Bolsheviks, the February Revolution
would not have occurred!

The backward nature of the Bolshevik style of party can also be seen
from events 12 years earlier. In 1905, workers spontaneously organised
councils of workers' delegates ("soviets" in Russian). The soviets were
based on workplaces electing recallable delegates to co-ordinate strikes
and were created by the Russian workers themselves, independently of
political parties.

Far from being at the vanguard of these developments the Bolsheviks
were, in fact, deeply hostile to them. The Bolshevik Central Committee
members in Petersburg were uneasy at the thought of a *"non-Party"* mass
organisation existing side by side with their party. Instead of seeing
the Soviet as a form of workers' self-organisation and self-activity
(and so a key area for area for activity), they regarded it with
hostility. They saw it as a rival to the party.

The St. Petersburg Bolsheviks organised a campaign against the Soviet
due to its *"non-Party"* nature. They presented an ultimatum to the
Soviet that it must place itself under the leadership of their party. On
24 October they had moved a resolution along the same lines in meetings
at the various factories, demanding that the Soviet accept the Social
Democratic programme and tactics and demanding that it must define its
political stance.

The Bolshevik Central Committee then published a resolution, that was
binding upon all Bolsheviks throughout Russia, insisting that the
soviets must accept the party programme. Agitation against the soviet
continued. On 29 October, the Bolshevik's Nevsky district committee
declared inadmissible for Social Democrats to participate in any kind of
*"workers' parliament"* like the Soviet.

The Bolshevik argument was that the Soviet of Workers' Deputies should
not have existed as a political organisation and that the social
democrats must withdraw from it, since its existence acted negatively
upon the development of the social democratic movement. The Soviet of
Delegates could remain as a trade union organisation, or not at all.
Indeed, the Bolsheviks presented the Soviet with an ultimatum: either
accept the programme of the Bolsheviks or else disband! The Bolshevik
leaders justified their hostility to the Soviet on the grounds that it
represented *"the subordination of consciousness to spontaneity"* -- in
this they followed Lenin's arguments in **What is to be Done?**. When
they moved their ultimatum in the Soviet it was turned down and the
Bolshevik delegates, led by the Central Committee members, walked out.
The other delegates merely shrugged their shoulders and proceeded to the
next point on the agenda.

If workers had followed the Bolsheviks the 1905 revolution would not
have occurred and the first major experience of workers' councils would
never have happened. Rather than being in favour of working class
self-management and power, the Bolsheviks saw revolution in terms of
party power. This confusion remained during and after 1917 when the
Bolsheviks finally supported the soviets (although purely as a means of
ensuring a Bolshevik government).

Similarly, during the British Poll Tax rebellion of the late 1980s and
early 1990s, the SWP dismissed the community based mass non-payment
campaign. Instead they argued for workers to push their trade unions
leadership to call strikes to overthrow the tax. Indeed, the even argued
that there was a *"danger that community politics divert people from the
means to won, from the need to mobilise working class activity on a
collective basis"* by which they meant trade union basis. They argued
that the state machine would *"wear down community resistance if it
cannot tap the strength of the working class."* Of course it goes
without saying that the aim of the community-based non-payment campaign
was working class activity on a collective basis. This explains the
creation of anti-poll tax unions, organising demonstrations, occupations
of sheriff officers/bailiffs offices and council buildings, the attempts
to resist warrant sales by direct action, the attempts to create links
with rank-and-file trade unionists and so on. Indeed, the SWP's strategy
meant mobilising **fewer** people in collective struggle as trade union
members were a minority of those affected by the tax as well as
automatically excluding those workers **not** in unions, people who were
unemployed, housewives, students and so on. Little wonder the SWP failed
to make much of an impact in the campaign.

However, once non-payment began in earnest and showed hundreds of
thousands involved and refusing to pay, overnight the SWP became
passionate believers in the collective class power of community based
non-payment. They argued, in direct contradiction to their earlier
analysis, that the state was *"shaken by the continuing huge scale of
non-payment."* [quoted by Trotwatch, **Carry on Recruiting**, pp. 29-31]

The SWP proved to be totally unresponsive to new forms of struggle and
organisation produced by working class people when resisting the
government. In this they followed the Bolshevik tradition closely -- the
Bolsheviks initially ignored the soviets created during the 1905 Russian
Revolution and then asked them to disband. They only recognised their
importance in 1917, 12 years after that revolution was defeated and the
soviets had re-appeared.

Therefore, the fact that the self-proclaimed "vanguard of the
proletarian" is actually miles behind the struggle comes as no surprise.
Nor are their slanders against those, like anarchists, who are at the
front of the struggle unsurprising. They produced similar articles
during the poll tax rebellion as well, to counter anarchist influence by
smearing our ideas.

2. What does the SWP miss out in its definition of anarchism?
-------------------------------------------------------------

The SWP continue:

> *"Anarchism is generally taken to mean a rejection of all authority."*

One question immediately arises. What do anarchists mean by the term
*"authority"*? Without knowing that, it will be difficult to evaluate
the SWP's arguments.

Kropotkin provides the answer. He argued that *"the origin of the
anarchist inception of society . . . [lies in] the criticism . . . of
the hierarchical organisations and the authoritarian conceptions of
society; and . . . the analysis of the tendencies that are seen in the
progressive movements of mankind."* He stresses that anarchism *"refuses
all hierarchical organisation."* [**Kropotkin's Revolutionary
Pamphlets**, p. 158 and p. 137]

Thus anarchism rejects authority in the sense, to use Malatesta's words,
of *"the delegation of power, that is the abdication of initiative and
sovereignty of all into the hands a few."* [**Anarchy**, p. 40] Once
this is clearly understood, it will quickly been seen that the SWP
create a straw man to defeat in argument.

Moreover, by concentrating on what anarchism is **against** the SWP can
ignore what anarchism is **for**. This is important as to discuss the
positive ideas of anarchism would mean having to discuss anarchists
ideas on organisation, why we oppose centralisation, favour federalism
as a means of co-ordinating decisions, why we propose self-management in
place of government, and so on. To do this would mean accurately
presenting libertarian theory rather than a just series of slanders,
which, of course, the SWP would hate to do.

So what is anarchism for?

Anarchism derives from the Greek for ***"without authority"** or
***"without rulers"** and this informs anarchist theory and visions of a
better world. This means that anarchism is against the *"domination of
man by man"* (and woman by woman, woman by man, and so on). However,
*"[a]s knowledge has penetrated the governed masses . . . the people
have revolted against the form of authority then felt most intolerable.
This spirit of revolt in the individual and the masses, is the natural
and necessary fruit of the spirit of domination; the vindication of
human dignity, and the saviour of social life."* Thus *"freedom is the
necessary preliminary to any true and equal human association."*
[Charlotte Wilson, **Anarchist Essays**, p. 54 and p. 40] In other
words, anarchist comes from the struggle of the oppressed against their
rulers and is an expression of individual and social freedom. Anarchism
was born from the class struggle.**

This means, positively, that anarchists stress the need for
***self-government*** (often called ***self-management***) of both
individuals and groups. Self-management within free associations and
decision making from the bottom-up is the only way domination can be
eliminated. This is because, by making our own decisions ourselves, we
automatically end the division of society into governors and governed
(i.e. end hierarchy). In other words, those affected by a decision make
that decision. Anarchism clearly means support for freedom and equality
and so all forms of hierarchical organisation (such as the state and the
capitalist workplace) and authoritarian social relationship (such as
sexism, racism, homophobia and wage labour) must be abolished. This
means that anarchist organisations must be self-managed, decentralised
and based on federalism. Only this form of organisation can end the
division of society into rulers and ruled, oppressor and oppressed,
exploiter and exploited and create a society of free and equal
individuals.

This is why anarchists stress such things as decision making by mass
assemblies and the co-ordination of decisions by mandated and recallable
delegates. The federal structure which unites these basic assemblies
would allow local affairs to be decided upon locally and directly, with
wider issues discussed and decided upon at their appropriate level and
by all involved. This would allow those affected by a decision to have a
say in it, so allowing them to manage their own affairs directly and
without hierarchy. This, in turn, would encourage the self-reliance,
self-confidence and initiative of those involved. As a necessary
complement of our opposition to authority is support for ***"direct
action."** This means that people, rather than looking to leaders or
politicians to act for them, look to themselves and the own individual
and collective strength to solve their own problems. This also
encourages self-liberation, self-reliance and self-confidence as the
prevailing culture would be *"if we want something sorted out, we have
to do it ourselves"* -- in other words, a *"do it yourself"* mentality.*

Therefore, the **positive** side of anarchism (which naturally flows
from its opposition to authority) results in a political theory which
argues that people must control their own struggles, organisations and
affairs directly. This means we support mass assemblies and their
federation via councils of mandated delegates subject to recall if they
break their mandates (i.e. they act as they see fit, i.e. as politicians
or bureaucrats, and not as the people who elected them desire). This way
people directly govern themselves and control their own lives. It means
we oppose the state and support free federations of self-governing
associations and communes. It means we oppose capitalism and support
workers' self-management. It means we reject hierarchy, centralism and
authoritarian structures and argue for self-managed organisations, built
from the bottom up and always accountable to the base. It means we
consider the direct control of struggles and movements by those involved
as not only essential in the here and now but also essential training
for living in a free, libertarian socialist society (for example,
workers direct and total control of their strikes and unions trains them
to control their workplaces and communities during and after the
revolution). It means we oppose hierarchy in all its forms and support
free association of equals. In other words, anarchism can generally be
taken to mean support for self-government or self-management.

By discussing only the negative side of anarchism, by missing out what
kinds of authority anarchists oppose, the SWP ensure that these aspects
of our ideas are not mentioned in their article. For good reason as it
puts Marxism in a bad light.

3. Why does mentioning the history of anarchism weaken the SWP's argument?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

The SWP correctly argue that we *"live in a world of bullying line
managers, petty school rules, oppressive police, and governments that
serve the rich and powerful."* However, they trivialise anarchism (and
the natural feelings that result from such domination) by stating
*"[e]veryone who hates that has, at least at times, felt a streak of
'anarchist' revolt against authority."* Thus anarchism is presented as
an emotional response rather than as valid, coherent intellectual
opposition to the state, wage labour, inequality and hierarchical
authority in general. But, of course, anarchism is more than this, as
the SWP acknowledge:

> *"Anarchism, however, is more than a personal reaction against the
> tyrannies of capitalism. It is a set of political beliefs which have
> been held up as an alternative to the revolutionary socialist ideas of
> Karl Marx. Anarchist ideas have, on occasion, had a mass influence on
> movements against capitalism."*

Given that the *"revolutionary socialist ideas"* of Marx have been
proven wrong on numerous occasions while Bakunin's predictions were
proven right, anarchists humbly suggest that anarchism is a valid
alternative to Marxism. For example, Bakunin correctly predicted that
when *"the workers . . . send common workers . . . to Legislative
Assemblies . . . The worker-deputies, transplanted into a bourgeois
environment, into an atmosphere of purely bourgeois ideas, will in fact
cease to be workers and, becoming Statesmen, they will become bourgeois
. . . For men do not make their situations; on the contrary, men are
made by them."* [**The Basic Bakunin**, p. 108] The history of the
Marxist Social Democratic Parties across the world proved him right.

Similarly, Bakunin predicted that Marx's *"dictatorship of the
proletariat"* would become the *"dictatorship over the proletariat."*
The experience of the Russian Revolution proved him correct -- once the
Bolshevik party had become the government power became centralised at
the top, the workers' soviets quickly became a cog in the state
machinery rubber-stamping the decrees of the Bolshevik government,
workers' control of production by factory committees was replaced by
state appointed managers and so on. The "socialist" state quickly became
a bureaucratic monster without real control from below (indeed, the
Bolsheviks actually disbanded soviets when opposition parties won a
majority in them at the start of 1918). The start of the Civil War in
May 1918 just made things worse.

The SWP continue by arguing:

> *"Socialists and anarchists share a hatred of capitalism. They have
> often fought alongside each other in major battles against the
> capitalist system. They struggled together in the Europe-wide mass
> strikes at the end of the First World War and the inspiring Spanish
> Revolution in 1936, as well as in countless smaller battles today."*

Which is true. They also fail to mention that the mass-strikes at the
end of the First World War were defeated by the actions of the
Social-Democratic Parties and trade unions. These parties were
self-proclaimed revolutionary Marxist organisations, utilising (as Marx
had argued) the ballot box and centralised organisations.
Unsurprisingly, given the tactics and structure, reformism and
bureaucracy had developed within them. When workers took strike action,
even occupying their factories in Italy, the bureaucracy of the Social
Democratic Parties and trade unions acted to undermine the struggle,
isolating workers and supporting capitalism. Indeed, the German Social
Democratic Party (which was, pre-1914, considered the jewel in the crown
of Marxism and the best means to refute the anarchist critique of
Marxist tactics) actually organised an alliance with the right-wing
para-military Freikorps to violently suppress the revolution. The
Marxist movement had degenerated into bourgeois parties, as Bakunin
predicted.

It is also strange that the SWP mention the *"inspiring Spanish
Revolution in 1936"* as this revolution was mainly anarchist in its
*"inspiring"* features. Workers took over workplaces and the land,
organising them under workers' self-management. Direct democracy was
practised by hundreds of thousands of workers in line with the
organisational structures of the anarchist union the C.N.T. In contrast,
the Russian Revolution saw power become centralised into the hands of
the Bolshevik party leadership and workers' self- management of
production was eliminated in favour of one-man management imposed from
above (see M. Brinton's **The Bolsheviks and Workers' Control** for
details).

4. How is the SWP wrong about centralisation?
---------------------------------------------

The SWP continue by arguing that *"there are differences between
revolutionary socialism and anarchism. Both understand the need for
organisation but disagree over what form that organisation takes."* This
is a vast step forward in the usual Marxist slander that anarchists
reject the need for organisation and so should be welcomed.
Unfortunately the rest of the discussion on this issue falls back into
the usual swamp of slander.

They argue that *"[e]very struggle, from a local campaign against
housing privatisation to a mass strike of millions of workers, raises
the need for organisation. People come together and need mechanisms for
deciding what to do and how to do it."* They continue by arguing that
*"Anarchism says that organisation has nothing to do with
centralisation. For anarchism, any form of centralisation is a type of
authority, which is oppressive."*

This is true, anarchists do argue that centralisation places power at
the centre, so disempowering the people at the base of an organisation.
In order to co-ordinate activity anarchists propose federal structures,
made up on mandated delegates from autonomous assemblies. In this way,
co-ordination is achieved while ensuring that power remains at the
bottom of the organisation, in the hands of those actually fighting or
doing the work. Federalism does not deny the need to make agreements and
to co-ordinate decisions. Far from it -- it was put forward by
anarchists precisely to ensure co-ordination of joint activity and to
make agreements in such a way as to involve those subject to those
decisions in the process of making them. Federalism **involves** people
in managing their own affairs and so they develop their initiative,
self-reliance, judgement and spirit of revolt so that they can **act**
intelligently, quickly and autonomously during a crisis or revolutionary
moment and show solidarity as and when required instead of waiting for
commands from above as occurs with centralised movements. In other
words, federalism is the means to combine participation and
co-ordination and to create an organisation run from the bottom up
rather than the top-down. As can be seen, anarchists do not oppose
co-ordination and co-operation, making agreements and implementing them
together.

After mentioning centralisation, the SWP make a massive jump of logic
and assert:

> *"But arguing with someone to join a struggle, and trying to put
> forward tactics and ideas that can take it forward are attempts to
> lead.*
> "It is no good people coming together in a struggle, discussing what
> to do and then doing just what they feel like as if no discussion had
> taken place. We always need to take the best ideas and act on them in
> a united way."

Placing ideas before a group of people is a "lead" but it is not
centralisation. Moreover, anarchists are not against making agreements!
Far from it. The aim of federal organisation is to make agreements, to
co-ordinate struggles and activities. This does not mean ignoring
agreements. As Kropotkin argued, the commune *"cannot any longer
acknowledge any superior: that, above it, there cannot be anything, save
the interests of the Federation, freely embraced by itself in concert
with other Communes."* [**No Gods, No Masters**, vol. 1, p. 259] This
vision was stressed in the C.N.T.'s resolution on Libertarian Communism
made in May, 1936, which stated that *"the foundation of this
administration will be the Commune. These Communes are to be autonomous
and will be federated at regional and national levels for the purpose of
achieving goals of a general nature. The right of autonomy is not to
preclude the duty of implementation of agreements regarding collective
benefits."* [quoted by Jose Pierats, **The C.N.T. in the Spanish
Revolution**, p. 68] In the words of Malatesta:

> *"But an organisation, it is argued, presupposes an obligation to
> co-ordinate one's own activities with those of others; thus it
> violates liberty and fetters initiative. As we see it, what really
> takes away liberty and makes initiative impossible is the isolation
> which renders one powerless. Freedom is not an abstract right but the
> possibility of acting . . . it is by co-operation with his fellows
> that man finds the means to express his activity and his power of
> initiative."* [**Life and Ideas**, pp. 86-7]

Hence anarchists do not see making collective decisions and working in a
federation as an abandonment of autonomy or a violation of anarchist
theory and principles. Rather, we see such co-operation and
co-ordination, generated from below upwards, as an essential means of
exercising and protecting freedom.

The SWP's comment against anarchism is a typical Marxist position. The
assumption seems to be that "centralisation" or "centralism" equals
co-ordination and, because we reject centralisation, anarchists must
reject co-ordination, planning and agreements. However, in actuality,
anarchists have always stressed the need for federalism to co-ordinate
joint activities, stressing that decision-making and organisation must
flow from below upwards so that the mass of the population can manage
their own affairs directly (i.e. practice self-management and so
anarchy). Unfortunately, Marxists fail to acknowledge this, instead
asserting we are against co-operation, co-ordination and making
agreements. The SWP's arguments are an example of this, making spurious
arguments about the need for making agreements.

In this the SWP are following in a long-line of Marxist inventions. For
example, Engels asserted in his infamous diatribe *"The Bakuninists at
work"* that Bakunin *"[a]s early as September 1870 (in his **Lettres a
un francais** [Letters to a Frenchman]) . . . had declared that the only
way to drive the Prussians out of France by a revolutionary struggle was
to do away with all forms of centralised leadership and leave each town,
each village, each parish to wage war on its own."* [Marx, Engels and
Lenin, **Anarchism and Anarcho-Syndicalism**, p. 141]

In fact, the truth is totally different. Bakunin does, of course, reject
*"centralised leadership"* as it would be *"necessarily very
circumscribed, very short-sighted, and its limited perception cannot,
therefore, penetrate the depth and encompass the whole complex range of
popular life."* However, it is a falsehood to state that he denies the
need for co-ordination of struggles and federal organisation from the
bottom up in that or any other work. As he puts it, the revolution must
*"foster the self-organisation of the masses into autonomous bodies,
federated from the bottom upwards."* With regards to the peasants, he
thinks they will *"come to an understanding, and form some kind of
organisation . . . to further their mutual interests . . . the necessity
to defend their homes, their families, and their own lives against
unforeseen attack . . . will undoubtedly soon compel them to contract
new and mutually suitable arrangements."* The peasants would be *"freely
organised from the bottom up."* [*"Letters to a French"*, **Bakunin on
Anarchism**, p. 196, p. 206 and p. 207] In this he repeated his earlier
arguments concerning social revolution -- claims Engels was well aware
of, just as he was well aware of the statements by Bakunin in his
*"Letters to a Frenchman."* In other words, Engels deliberately lied
about Bakunin's political ideas. It appears that the SWP is simply
following the Marxist tradition in their article.

5. Why does the SWP's *"picket line is 'authoritarian'"* argument totally miss the point?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

They continue by arguing:

> *"Not all authority is bad. A picket line is 'authoritarian.' It tries
> to impose the will of the striking workers on the boss, the police and
> on any workers who may be conned into scabbing on the strike."*

What should strike the reader about this example is its total lack of
class analysis. In this the SWP follow Engels. In his essay **On
Authority**, Engels argues that a *"revolution is certainly the most
authoritarian thing there is; it is the act whereby one part of the
population imposes its will upon the other part by means of rifles,
bayonets and cannon-authoritarian means, if such there be at all; and if
the victorious party does not want to have fought in vain, it must
maintain this rule by means of the terror its arms inspire in the
reactionaries."* [**The Marx-Engels Reader**, p. 733]

However, such an analysis is without a class basis and so will, by
necessity, mislead the writer and the reader. Engels argues that
revolution is the imposition by *"one part of the population"* on
another. Very true -- but Engels fails to indicate the nature of class
society and, therefore, of a social revolution. In a class society *"one
part of the population"* constantly *"imposes its will upon the other
part"* all the time. In other words, the ruling class imposes its will
on the working class everyday in work by the hierarchical structure of
the workplace and in society by the state. Discussing the *"population"*
as if it was not divided by classes, and so subject to specific forms of
authoritarian social relationships, is liberal nonsense. Once we
recognise that the *"population"* in question is divided into classes we
can easily see the fallacy of Engels argument. In a social revolution,
the act of revolution is the overthrow of the power and authority of an
oppressing and exploiting class by those subject to that oppression and
exploitation. In other words, it is an act of liberation in which the
hierarchical power of the few over the many is eliminated and replaced
by the freedom of the many to control their own lives. It is hardly
authoritarian to destroy authority! Thus a social revolution is,
fundamentally, an act of liberation for the oppressed who act in their
own interests to end the system in which *"one part of population
imposes its will upon the other"* everyday.

This applies equally to the SWP's example of a picket line. Is a picket
line really authoritarian because it tries to impose its will on the
boss, police or scabs? Rather, is it not defending the workers' freedom
against the authoritarian power of the boss and their lackeys (the
police and scabs)? Is it *"authoritarian"* to resist authority and
create a structure -- a strike assembly and picket line -- which allows
the formally subordinated workers to manage their own affairs directly
and without bosses? Is it *"authoritarian"* to combat the authority of
the boss, to proclaim your freedom and exercise it? Of course not. The
SWP are playing with words.

Needless to say, it is a large jump from the "authority" of a strikers'
assembly to that of a highly centralised "workers' state" but that, of
course, is what the SWP wish the reader to do. Comparing a strikers'
assembly and picket line -- which is a form of self-managed association
-- with a state cannot be done. It fails to recognise the fundamental
difference. In the strikers' assembly and picket line the strikers
themselves decide policy and do not delegate power away. In a state,
power is delegated into the hands of a few who then use that power as
they see fit. This by necessity disempowers those at the base, who are
turned into mere electors and order takers. Such a situation can only
spell death of a social revolution, which requires the active
participation of all if it is to succeed. It also exposes the central
fallacy of Marxism, namely that it claims to desire a society based on
the participation of everyone yet favours a form of organisation --
centralisation -- that precludes that participation.

6. Why are the SWP's examples of *"state functions"* wrong?
-----------------------------------------------------------

The SWP continue their diatribe against anarchism:

> *"Big workers' struggles throw up an alternative form of authority to
> the capitalist state. Militant mass strikes throw up workers'
> councils. These are democratic bodies, like strike committees. But
> they take on organising 'state functions' -- transport, food
> distribution, defence of picket lines and workers' areas from the
> police and army, and so on."*

To state the obvious, transportation and food distribution are not
*"state functions."* They are economic functions. Similarly, defence is
not a *"state function"* as such -- after all, individuals can and do
defend themselves against aggression, strikers organise themselves to
defend themselves against cops and hired strike breakers, and so on.
This means that defence can be organised in a **libertarian** fashion,
directly by those involved and based on self-managed workers' militias
and federations of free communes. It need not be the work of a state nor
need it be organised in a statist (i.e. hierarchical) fashion like, for
example, the current bourgeois state and military or the Bolshevik Red
Army (where the election of officers, soldiers' councils and
self-governing assemblies were abolished by Trotsky in favour of
officers appointed from above). So "defence" is **not** a state
function.

What is a *"state function"* is imposing the will of a minority -- the
government, the boss, the bureaucrat -- onto the population via
professional bodies such as the police and military. This is what the
Bolshevik state did, with workers' councils turned into state bodies
executing the decrees of the government and using a specialised and
hierarchical army and police force to do so. The difference is
important. Luigi Fabbri sums up it well:

> *"The mistake of authoritarian communists in this connection is the
> belief that fighting and organising are impossible without submission
> to a government; and thus they regard anarchists . . . as the foes of
> all organisation and all co-ordinated struggle. We, on the other hand,
> maintain that not only are revolutionary struggle and revolutionary
> organisation possible outside and in spite of government interference
> but that, indeed, that is the only effective way to struggle and
> organise, for it has the active participation of all members of the
> collective unit, instead of their passively entrusting themselves to
> the authority of the supreme leaders.*
> "Any governing body is an impediment to the real organisation of the
> broad masses, the majority. Where a government exists, then the only
> really organised people are the minority who make up the government;
> and . . . if the masses do organise, they do so against it, outside
> it, or at the very least, independently of it. In ossifying into a
> government, the revolution as such would fall apart, on account of its
> awarding that government the monopoly of organisation and of the means
> of struggle." [*"Anarchy and 'Scientific' Communism"*, in **The
> Poverty of Statism**, pp. 13-49, Albert Meltzer (ed.), p. 27]

Thus the difference between anarchists and Leninists is not whether the
organisations workers' create in struggle will be the framework of a
free society (or the basis of the Commune). Indeed, anarchists have been
arguing this for longer than Marxists have. The difference is whether
these organisations remain self-managed or whether they become part of a
centralised state. In the words of Camillo Berneri:

> *"The Marxists . . . foresee the natural disappearance of the State as
> a consequence of the destruction of classes by the means of 'the
> dictatorship of the proletariat,' that is to say State Socialism,
> whereas the Anarchists desire the destruction of the classes by means
> of a social revolution which eliminates, with the classes, the State.
> The Marxists, moreover, do not propose the armed conquest of the
> Commune by the whole proletariat, but the propose the conquest of the
> State by the party which imagines that it represents the proletariat.
> The Anarchists allow the use of direct power by the proletariat, but
> they understand by the organ of this power to be formed by the entire
> corpus of systems of communist administration-corporate organisations
> [i.e. industrial unions], communal institutions, both regional and
> national-freely constituted outside and in opposition to all political
> monopoly by parties and endeavouring to a minimum administrational
> centralisation."* [*"Dictatorship of the Proletariat and State
> Socialism"*, **Cienfuegos Press Anarchist Review**, no. 4, p. 52]

So, anarchists agree, in *"big workers' struggles"* organisation is
essential and can form an alternative to the capitalist state. However,
such a framework only becomes an "authority" when power is transferred
from the base into the hands of an executive committee at the top.
Strike and community assemblies, by being organs of self-management, are
not an "authority" in the same sense that the state is or the boss is.
Rather, they are the means by which people can manage their own
struggles (and so affairs) directly, to govern themselves and so do
without the need for hierarchical authority.

The SWP, in other words, confuse two very different things.

7. What is ironic about the SWP's comment that workers' councils must *"break up"* the capitalist state?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After misunderstanding basic concepts, the SWP treat us to a history
lesson:

> *"Such councils were a feature of the Russian revolutions of 1905 and
> 1917, the German Revolution after the First World War, the Spanish
> Revolution of 1936, and many other great struggles. Socialists argue
> that these democratic workers' organisations need to take power from
> the capitalists and break up their state."*

Anarchists agree. Indeed, they argued that workers' organisations should
*"break up"* and replace the state long before Lenin discovered this in
1917. For example, Bakunin argued in the late 1860s that the
International Workers' Association, an *"international organisation of
workers' associations from all countries"*, would *"be able to take the
revolution into its own hands"* and be *"capable of replacing this
departing political world of States and bourgeoisie."* The *"natural
organisation of the masses"* was *"organisation by trade association,"*
in other words, by unions, *"from the bottom up."* The means of creating
socialism would be *"**emancipation through practical action** . . .
workers' solidarity in their struggle against the bosses. It means
**trades unions**, **organisation**"* The very process of struggle would
create the framework of a new society, a federation of workers'
councils, as *"strikes indicate a certain collective strength already, a
certain understanding among the workers . . . each strike becomes the
point of departure for the formation of new groups."* He stresses the
International was a product of the class war as it *"has not created the
war between the exploiter and the exploited; rather, the requirements of
that war have created the International."* Thus the seeds of the future
society are created by the class struggle, by the needs of workers to
organise themselves to resist the boss and the state. [**The Basic
Bakunin**, p. 110, p. 139, p. 103 and p. 150]

He stressed that the revolution would be based on federations of
workers' associations, in other words, workers' councils:

> *"the federative alliance of all working men's associations . . .
> [will] constitute the Commune . . . [the] Communal Council [will be]
> composed of . . . delegates . . . vested with plenary but accountable
> and removable mandates. . . all provinces, communes and associations .
> . . by first reorganising on revolutionary lines . . . [will]
> constitute the federation of insurgent associations, communes and
> provinces . . . [and] organise a revolutionary force capable defeating
> reaction . . . [and for] self-defence . . . [The] revolution
> everywhere must be created by the people, and supreme control must
> always belong to the people organised into a free federation of
> agricultural and industrial associations . . . organised from the
> bottom upwards by means of revolutionary delegation. . ."* [**Michael
> Bakunin: Selected Writings**, pp. 170-2]

And:

> *"The future social organisation must be made solely from the bottom
> up, by the free association or federation of workers, firstly in their
> unions, then in the communes, regions, nations and finally in a great
> federation, international and universal."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 206]

Thus it is somewhat ironic to have Leninists present basic anarchist
ideas as if they had thought of them first!

Then again, the ability of the Marxists to steal anarchist ideas and
claim them as their own is well know. They even rewrite history to do
so. For example, the SWP's John Rees in the essay *"In Defence of
October"* argues that *"since Marx's writings on the Paris Commune"* a
*"cornerstone of revolutionary theory"* was *"that the soviet is a
superior form of democracy because it unifies political and economic
power."* [**International Socialism**, no. 52, p. 25] Nothing could be
further from the truth, as Marx's writings on the Paris Commune prove.

The Paris Commune, as Marx himself argued, was *"formed of the municipal
councillors, chosen by universal suffrage in the various wards of the
town."* [*"The Civil War in France"*, **Selected Works**, p. 287] As
Marx made clear, it was definitely **not** based on delegates from
workplaces and so could **not** unify political and economic power.
Indeed, to state that the Paris Commune was a soviet is simply a joke,
as is the claim that Marxists supported soviets as revolutionary organs
to smash and replace the state from 1871. In fact Marxists did not
subscribe to this *"cornerstone of revolutionary theory"* until 1917
when Lenin argued that the Soviets would be the best means of ensuring a
Bolshevik government.

Indeed the **only** political movement which took the position Rees
falsely ascribes to Marxism was anarchism. This can be clearly seen from
Bakunin's works, a few representative quotes we have provided above.
Moreover, Bakunin's position dates, we must stress, from **before** the
Paris Commune. This position has been argued by revolutionary anarchists
ever since -- decades before Marxists did.

Similarly, Rees argues that *"the socialist revolution must counterpose
the soviet to parliament . . . because it needs an organ which combines
economic power -- the power to strike and take control of the workplaces
-- with an insurrectionary bid for political power, breaking the old
state."* [**Ibid.**] However, he is just repeating anarchist arguments
made decades before Lenin's temporary conversion to the soviets. In the
words of the anarchist Jura Federation (written in 1880):

> *"The bourgeoisie's power over the popular masses springs from
> economic privileges, political domination and the enshrining of such
> privileges in the laws. So we must strike at the wellsprings of
> bourgeois power, as well as its various manifestations.*
>
> "The following measures strike us as essential to the welfare of the
> revolution, every bit as much as armed struggle against its enemies:
>
> "The insurgents must confiscate social capital, landed estates, mines,
> housing, religious and public buildings, instruments of labour, raw
> materials, gems and precious stones and manufactured products:
>
> "All political, administrative and judicial authorities are to be
> abolished.
>
> ". . . What should the organisational measures of the revolution be?
>
> "Immediate and spontaneous establishment of trade bodies: provisional
> assumption by those of . . . social capital . . .: local federation of
> a trades bodies and labour organisation:
>
> "Establishment of neighbourhood groups and federations of same . . .
>
> [. . .]
>
> "[T]he federation of all the revolutionary forces of the insurgent
> Communes . . . Federation of Communes and organisation of the masses,
> with an eye to the revolution's enduring until such time as all
> reactionary activity has been completely eradicated.
>
> [. . .]
>
> "Once trade bodies have been have been established, the next step is
> to organise local life. The organ of this life is to be the federation
> of trades bodies and it is this local federation which is to
> constitute the future Commune." [**No Gods, No Masters**, vol. 1, pp.
> 246-7]

As can be seen, long before Lenin's turn towards the soviets as a means
of the Bolsheviks taking power, **anarchists**, not Marxists, had argued
that we must counterpose the council of workers' delegates (by trade in
the case of the Jura federation, by workplace in the case of the later
anarcho-syndicalist unions, anarchist theory and the soviets).
Anarchists clearly saw that, to quote Bakunin, *"[n]o revolution could
succeed . . . today unless it was simultaneously a political and a
social revolution."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 141] Unlike Marx, who clearly saw
a political revolution (the conquest of state power) coming **before**
the economic transformation of society (*"The political rule of the
producer cannot coexist with the perpetuation of his social slavery. The
Commune was therefore to serve as a lever for uprooting the economical
foundations upon which rests the existence of classes and therefore of
class-rule."* [Marx, **Op. Cit.**, p. 290]). This is why anarchists saw
the social revolution in terms of economic and social organisation and
action as its first steps were to eliminate both capitalism and the
state.

Rees, in other words, is simply stating anarchist theory as if Marxists
have been arguing the same thing since 1871!

Moreover, anarchists predicted other ideas that Marx took from the
experience of the Paris Commune. Marx praised the fact that each
delegate to the Commune was *"at any time revocable and bound by the
**mandat imperatif** (formal instructions) of his constituents . . .
[and so] strictly responsible agents."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 288]
Anarchists had held this position a number of years **before** the
Commune introduced it. Proudhon was arguing in 1848 for *"universal
suffrage and as a consequence of universal suffrage, we want
implementation of the binding mandate. Politicians balk at it! Which
means that in their eyes, the people, in electing representatives, do
not appoint mandatories but rather abjure their sovereignty! That is
assuredly not socialism: it is not even democracy."* [**No Gods, No
Masters**, vol. 1, p. 63] We find Bakunin arguing exactly the same. For
example, in 1868 he wrote that the *"Revolutionary Communal Council will
operate on the basis of one or two delegates from each barricade . . .
these deputies being invested with binding mandates and accountable and
revocable at all times."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 155]). In addition, the
similarities with the Commune's political ideas and Proudhon's are
clear, as are the similarities between the Russian Soviets and Bakunin's
views on revolution.

So, as well as predicting the degeneration of social democracy and the
Russian revolution, anarchists have also predicted such key aspects of
revolutionary situations as organising on the basis of workplace and
having delegates mandated and subject to instant recall. Such
predictions flow from taking part in social movements and analysing
their tendencies. Moreover, a revolution is the resisting of current
authorities and an act of self-liberation and so its parallels with
anarchism are clear. As such the class struggle, revolutionary movements
and revolutions have a libertarian basis and tendencies and, therefore,
it is unsurprising that anarchist ideas have spontaneously developed in
them. Thus we have a two way interaction between ideas and action.
Anarchist ideas have been produced spontaneously by the class struggle
due to its inherent nature as a force confronting authority and its need
for self-activity and self-organisation. Anarchism has learned from that
struggle and influenced it by its generalisations of previous
experiences and its basis in opposing hierarchy. Anarchist predictions,
therefore, come as no surprise.

Therefore, Marxists have not only been behind the class struggle itself,
they have also been behind anarchism in terms of practical ideas on a
social revolution and how to organise to transform society. While
anarchist ideas have been confirmed by the class struggle, Marxist ones
have had to be revised to bring them closer to the actual state of the
struggle and to the theoretical ideas of anarchism. And the SWP have the
cheek to present these ideas as if their tradition had thought of them!

Little wonder the SWP fail to present an honest account of anarchism.

8. How do the SWP re-write the history of the Russian Revolution?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Their history lesson continues:

> *"This happened in Russia in October 1917 in a revolution led by the
> Bolshevik Party."*

In reality, this did not happen. In October 1917, the Bolshevik Party
took power in the name of the workers' councils, the councils themselves
did not take power. This is confirmed by Trotsky, who notes that the
Bolshevik Party conference of April 1917 *"was devoted to the following
fundamental question: Are we heading toward the conquest of power in the
name of the socialist revolution or are we helping (anybody and
everybody) to complete the democratic revolution? . . . Lenin's position
was this: . . . the capture of the soviet majority; the overthrow of the
Provisional Government; the seizure of power through the soviets."*
Note, **through** the soviets not **by** the soviets thus indicating the
fact the Party would hold the real power, not the soviets of workers'
delegates. Moreover, he states that *"to prepare the insurrection and to
carry it out under cover of preparing for the Second Soviet Congress and
under the slogan of defending it, was of inestimable advantage to us."*
He continued by noting that it was *"one thing to prepare an armed
insurrection under the naked slogan of the seizure of power by the
party, and quite another thing to prepare and then carry out an
insurrection under the slogan of defending the rights of the Congress of
Soviets."* The Soviet Congress just provided *"the legal cover"* for the
Bolshevik plans rather than a desire to see the Soviets actually start
managing society. [**The Lessons of October**]

In 1920, he argued that *"[w]e have more than once been accused of
having substituted for the dictatorships of the Soviets the dictatorship
of the party. Yet it can be said with complete justice that the
dictatorship of the Soviets became possible only be means of the
dictatorship of the party. It is thanks to the . . . party . . . [that]
the Soviets . . . [became] transformed from shapeless parliaments of
labour into the apparatus of the supremacy of labour. In this
'substitution' of the power of the party for the power of the working
class these is nothing accidental, and in reality there is no
substitution at all. The Communists express the fundamental interests of
the working class."* [**Terrorism and Communism**, p. 109]

In 1937 he continued this theme by arguing that *"the proletariat can
take power only through its vanguard."* Thus, rather than the working
class as a whole *"seizing power"*, it is the *"vanguard"* which takes
power -- *"a revolutionary party, even after seizing power . . . is
still by no means the sovereign ruler of society."* He mocked the
anarchist idea that a socialist revolution should be based on the
self-management of workers within their own autonomous class
organisations:

> *"Those who propose the abstraction of Soviets to the party
> dictatorship should understand that only thanks to the party
> dictatorship were the Soviets able to lift themselves out of the mud
> of reformism and attain the state form of the proletariat."*
> [**Stalinism and Bolshevism**]

As can be seen, over a 17 year period Trotsky argued that it was the
party which ruled, not the councils. The workers' councils became little
more than rubber-stamps for the Bolshevik government (and not even that,
as the central government only submitted a fraction of its decrees to
the Central Executive of the national soviet, and that soviet was not
even in permanent session). As Russian Anarchist Voline made clear
*"for, the anarchists declared, if 'power' really should belong to the
soviets, it could not belong to the Bolshevik Party, and if it should
belong to that Party, as the Bolsheviks envisaged, it could not belong
to the soviets."* [**The Unknown Revolution**, p. 213] In the words of
Kropotkin:

> *"The idea of soviets . . . councils of workers and peasants . . .
> controlling the economic and political life of the country is a great
> idea. All the more so, since it is necessarily follows that these
> councils should be composed of all who take part in the real
> production of national wealth by their own efforts.*
> "But as long as the country is governed by a party dictatorship, the
> workers' and peasants' councils evidently lose their entire
> significance. They are reduced to the passive rule formerly played by
> the 'States General,' when they were convoked by the king and had to
> combat an all-powerful royal council." [**Kropotkin's Revolutionary
> Pamphlets**, pp. 254-5]

In other words, the workers' councils took power in name only. Real
power rested with the central government and the workers' councils
become little more than a means to elect the government. Rather than
manage society directly, the soviets simply became a transmission belt
for the decrees and orders of the Bolshevik party. Hardly a system to
inspire anyone.

However, the history of the Russian Revolution has two important lessons
for members of the various anti-globalisation and anti-capitalist
groups. Firstly, as we noted in [section 1](append34.html#app1), is
usually miles behind the class struggle and the ideas developed in it.
As another example, we can point to the movement for workers' control
and self-management that developed around the factory committees during
the summer of 1917. It was the workers themselves, **not** the Bolshevik
Party, which raised the issue of workers' self-management and control
during the Russian Revolution. As historian S.A. Smith correctly
summarises, the *"factory committees launched the slogan of workers'
control of production quite independently of the Bolshevik party. It was
not until May that the party began to take it up."* [**Red Petrograd**,
p. 154] Given that the defining aspect of capitalism is wage labour, the
Russian workers' raised a clearly socialist demand that entailed its
abolition. It was the Bolshevik party, we must note, who failed to raise
above a *"trade union conscious"* in this and so many other cases.

Therefore, rather than being at the forefront of struggle and ideas, the
Bolsheviks were, in fact, busy trying to catch up. History has repeated
itself in the anti-capitalist demonstrations We should point out that
anarchists have supported the idea of workers' self-management of
production since 1840 and, unsurprisingly enough, were extremely active
in the factory committee movement in 1917.

The second lesson to be gained from the Russian Revolution is that while
the Bolsheviks happily (and opportunistically) took over popular slogans
and introduced them into their rhetoric, they rarely meant the same
thing to the Bolsheviks as they did to the masses. For example, as noted
above, the Bolsheviks took up the slogan *"All Power to the Soviets"*
but rather than mean that the Soviets would manage society directly they
actually meant the Soviets would delegate their power to a Bolshevik
government which would govern society in their name. Similarly with the
term *"workers' control of production."* As S.A. Smith correctly notes,
Lenin used *"the term ['workers' control'] in a very different sense
from that of the factory committees."* In fact Lenin's *"proposals . . .
[were] thoroughly statist and centralist in character, whereas the
practice of the factory committees was essentially local and
autonomous."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 154] Once in power, the Bolsheviks
systematically undermined the popular meaning of workers' control and
replaced it with their own, statist conception. This ultimately resulted
in the introduction of *"one-man management"* (with the manager
appointed from above by the state). This process is documented in
Maurice Brinton's **The Bolsheviks and Workers' Control**, who also
indicates the clear links between Bolshevik practice and Bolshevik
ideology as well as how both differed from popular activity and ideas.

Hence the comments by Russian Anarchist Peter Arshinov:

> *"Another no less important peculiarity is that [the] October
> [revolution of 1917] has two meanings -- that which the working'
> masses who participated in the social revolution gave it, and with
> them the Anarchist-Communists, and that which was given it by the
> political party [the Marxist-Communists] that captured power from this
> aspiration to social revolution, and which betrayed and stifled all
> further development. An enormous gulf exists between these two
> interpretations of October. The October of the workers and peasants is
> the suppression of the power of the parasite classes in the name of
> equality and self-management. The Bolshevik October is the conquest of
> power by the party of the revolutionary intelligentsia, the
> installation of its 'State Socialism' and of its 'socialist' methods
> of governing the masses."* [**The Two Octobers**]

The members of the "anti-capitalist" movements should bear that in mind
when the SWP uses the same rhetoric as they do. Appearances are always
deceptive when it comes to Leninists. The history of the Russian
Revolution indicates that while Leninists like the SWP can use the same
words as popular movements, their interpretation of them can differ
drastically.

Take, for example, the expression "anti-capitalist." The SWP will claim
that they, too, are "anti-capitalist" but, in fact, they are only
opposed to "free market" capitalism and actually support state
capitalism. Lenin, for example, argued that workers' must
*"**unquestioningly obey the single will** of the leaders of labour"* in
April 1918 along with granting *"individual executives dictatorial power
(or 'unlimited' powers)"* and that *"the appointment of individuals,
dictators with unlimited powers"* was, in fact, *"in general compatible
with the fundamental principles of Soviet government"* simply because
*"the history of revolutionary movements"* had *"shown"* that *"the
dictatorship of individuals was very often the expression, the vehicle,
the channel of the dictatorship of revolutionary classes."* He notes
that *"[u]ndoubtably, the dictatorship of individuals was compatible
with bourgeois democracy."* [**The Immediate Tasks of the Soviet
Government**, p. 34 and p. 32]

He confused state capitalism with socialism. *"State capitalism,"* he
wrote, *"is a complete material preparation for socialism, the threshold
of socialism, a rung on the ladder of history between which and the rung
called socialism there are no gaps."* [**Collected Works**, vol. 24, p.
259] He argued that socialism *"is nothing but the next step forward
from state capitalist monopoly. In other words, Socialism is merely
state capitalist monopoly **made to benefit the whole people**; by this
token it **ceases** to be capitalist monopoly."* [**The Threatening
Catastrophe and how to avoid it**, p. 37]

As Peter Arshinov argued, a *"fundamental fact"* of the Bolshevik
revolution was *"that the workers and the peasant labourers remained
within the earlier situation of 'working classes' -- producers managed
by authority from above."* He stressed that Bolshevik political and
economic ideas may have *"remov[ed] the workers from the hands of
individual capitalists"* but they *"delivered them to the yet more
rapacious hands of a single ever-present capitalist boss, the State. The
relations between the workers and this new boss are the same as earlier
relations between labour and capital . . . Wage labour has remained what
it was before, expect that it has taken on the character of an
obligation to the State. . . . It is clear that in all this we are
dealing with a simple substitution of State capitalism for private
capitalism."* [**The History of the Makhnovist Movement**, p. 35 and p.
71] Therefore, looking at Bolshevism in power and in theory it is clear
that it is not, in fact, "anti-capitalist" but rather in favour of state
capitalism and any appropriation of popular slogans was always under the
firm understanding that the Bolshevik interpretation of these ideas is
what will be introduced.

Therefore the SWP's attempt to re-write Russian History. The actual
events of the Russian Revolution indicate well the authoritarian and
state-capitalist nature of Leninist politics.

9. How do the SWP re-write the history of the Spanish Revolution?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The SWP, after re-writing Russian history, move onto Spanish history:

> *"It did not happen in Spain in 1936. The C.N.T., a trade union
> heavily influenced by anarchist ideas, led a workers' uprising in the
> city of Barcelona that year. Workers' councils effectively ran the
> city.*
>
> "But the capitalist state machine did not simply disappear. The
> government and its army, which was fighting against Franco's fascist
> forces, remained, although it had no authority in Barcelona.
>
> "The government even offered to hand power over to the leaders of the
> C.N.T. But the C.N.T. believed that any form of state was wrong. It
> turned down the possibility of forming a workers' state, which could
> have broken the fascists' coup and the capitalist state.
>
> "Worse, it accepted positions in a government that was dominated by
> pro-capitalist forces.
>
> "That government crushed workers' power in Barcelona, and in doing so
> fatally undermined the fight against fascism."

It is hard to know where to start with this distortion of history.

Firstly, we have to point out that the C.N.T. did lead a workers'
uprising in 1936 but in was in response to a military coup and occurred
all across Spain. The army was not *"fighting against Franco's fascist
forces"* but rather had been the means by which Franco had tried to
impose his version of fascism. Indeed, as the SWP know fine well, one of
the first acts the CNT did in the Spanish Revolution was to organise
workers' militias to go fight the army in those parts of Spain in which
the unions (particularly the CNT which lead the fighting) did not defeat
it by street fighting. Thus the C.N.T. faced the might of the Spanish
army rising in a fascist coup. That, as we shall see, influenced its
decisions.

By not mentioning (indeed, lying about) the actual conditions the CNT
faced in July 1936, the SWP ensure the reader cannot understand what
happened and why the CNT made the decisions it did. Instead the reader
is encouraged to think it was purely a result of anarchist theory.
Needless to say, the SWP have a fit when it is suggested the actions of
the Bolsheviks during the Russian Civil War were simply the result of
Leninist ideology and unaffected by the circumstances they were made in.
The logic is simple: the mistakes of Marxists are **never** their fault,
**never** derive from Marxist politics and are always attributable to
circumstances (regardless of the facts); the mistakes of anarchists,
however, **always** derive from their politics and can never be
explained by circumstances (regardless of counter-examples and those
circumstances). Once this is understood, the reason why the SWP
distorted the history of the Spanish Revolution becomes clear.

Secondly, anarchism does not think that the *"capitalist state machine"*
will *"simply disappear."* Rather, anarchists think that (to quote
Kropotkin) the revolution *"must smash the State and replace it with the
Federation [of workers' associations and communes] and it will act
accordingly."* [**No Gods, No Masters**, vol. 1, p. 259] In other words,
the state does not disappear, it is destroyed and replaced with a new,
libertarian, form of social structure. Thus the SWP misrepresents
anarchist theory.

Thirdly, yes, the Catalan government did offer to stand aside for the
C.N.T. and the C.N.T. rejected the offer. Why? The SWP claim that *"the
C.N.T. believed that any form of state was wrong"* and that is why it
did not take power. That is true, but what the SWP fail to mention is
more important. The C.N.T. refused to implement libertarian communism
after the defeat of the army uprising in July 1936 simply because it did
not want to be isolated nor have to fight the republican government as
well as the fascists (needless to say, such a decision, while
understandable, was wrong). But such historical information would
confuse the reader with facts and make their case against anarchism less
clear-cut.

Ironically the SWP's attack on the CNT indicates well the authoritarian
basis of its politics and its support of soviets simply as a means for
the party leaders to take power. After all, they obviously consider it a
mistake for the *"leaders of the CNT"* to refuse power. Trotsky made the
same point, arguing that:

> *"A revolutionary party, even having seized power (of which the
> anarchist leaders were incapable in spite of the heroism of the
> anarchist workers), is still by no means the sovereign ruler of
> society."* [**Stalinism and Bolshevism**]

Yet the SWP say they, and their political tradition, are for *"workers'
power"* yet, in practice, they clearly mean that power will be seized,
held and exercised by the workers' leaders. A strange definition of
"workers' power," we must admit but one that indicates well the
differences between anarchists and Marxists. The former aim for a
society based on workers' self-management. The latter desire a society
in which workers' delegate their power to control society (i.e. their
own lives) to the "leaders," to the "workers' party" who will govern on
their behalf. The "leaders" of the CNT quite rightly rejected such this
position -- unfortunately they also rejected the anarchist position at
the same time and decided to ignore their politics in favour of
collaborating with other anti-fascist unions and parties against Franco.

Simply put, either the workers' have the power or the leaders do. To
confuse the rule of the party with workers' self-management of society
lays the basis for party dictatorship (as happened in Russia). Sadly,
the SWP do exactly this and fail to learn the lessons of the Russian
Revolution.

Therefore, the SWP's argument against anarchism is logically flawed.
Yes, the CNT did not take state power. However, neither did it destroy
the state, as anarchist theory argues. Rather it ignored the state and
this was its undoing. Thus the SWP attacks anarchism for anarchists
failing to act in an anarchist manner! How strange.

One last point. The events of the Spanish Revolution are important in
another way for evaluating anarchism and Marxism. Faced with the
military coup, the Spanish government did nothing, even refusing to
distribute arms to the workers. The workers, however, took the
initiative, seized arms by direct action and took to the streets to
confront the army. Indeed, the dynamic response of the CNT members to
Franco's coup compared to the inaction of the Marxist inspired German
workers movement faced with Hitler's taking of power presents us with
another example of the benefits of federalism against centralism, of
anarchism against Marxism. The federal structure of the CNT had
accustomed its members to act for themselves, to show initiative and act
without waiting for orders from the centre. The centralised German
system did the opposite.

The SWP will argue, of course, that the workers were mislead by their
leaders ("who were only Marxists in name only"). The question then
becomes: why did they not act for themselves? Perhaps because the
centralised German workers' movement had eroded their members
initiative, self-reliance and spirit of revolt to such a degree that
they could no longer act without their leaders instructions? It may be
argued that with **better** leaders the German workers would have
stopped the Nazis, but such a plea fails to understand **why** better
leaders did not exist in the first place. A centralised movement
inevitably produces bureaucracy and a tendency for leaders to become
conservative and compromised.

All in all, rather than refute anarchism the experience of the Spanish
Revolution **confirms** it. The state needs to be destroyed, **not**
ignored or collaborated with, and replaced by a federation of workers'
councils organised from the bottom-up. By failing to do this, the CNT
did ensure the defeat of the revolution but it hardly indicates a
failure of anarchism. Rather it indicates a failure of anarchists who
made the wrong decision in extremely difficult circumstances.

Obviously it is impossible to discuss the question of the C.N.T. during
the Spanish Revolution in depth here. We address the issue of Marxist
interpretations of Spanish Anarchist history in the appendix [*"Marxism
and Spanish Anarchism."*](append32.html) [Section
20](append32.html#app20) of that appendix discusses the C.N.T.'s
decision to collaborate with the Republican State against Franco as well
as its implications for anarchism.

10. Do anarchists ignore the fact that ideas change through struggle?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The SWP try and generalise from these experiences:

> *"In different ways, the lessons of Russia and Spain are the same. The
> organisational questions thrown up in particular struggles are
> critical when it comes to the working class challenging capitalism.*
>
> "Workers face conflicting pressures. On the one hand, they are forced
> to compete in the labour market. They feel powerless, as an
> individual, against the boss.
>
> "That is why workers can accept the bosses' view of the world. At the
> same time constant attacks on workers' conditions create a need for
> workers to unite and fight back together.
>
> "These two pressures mean workers' ideas are uneven. Some see through
> the bosses' lies. Others can be largely taken in. Most part accept and
> part reject capitalist ideas. The overall consciousness of the working
> class is always shifting. People become involved in struggles which
> lead them to break with pro-capitalist ideas."

That is very true and anarchists are well aware of it. That is why
anarchists organise groups, produce propaganda, argue their ideas with
others and encourage direct action and solidarity. We do so because we
are aware that the ideas within society are mixed and that struggle
leads people to break with pro-capitalist ideas. To quote Bakunin:

> *"the germs of [socialist thought] . . . [are to] be found in the
> instinct of every earnest worker. The goal . . . is to make the worker
> fully aware of what he wants, to unjam within him a stream of thought
> corresponding to his instinct . . . What impedes the swifter
> development of this salutary though among the working masses? Their
> ignorance to be sure, that is, for the most part the political and
> religious prejudices with which self-interested classes still try to
> obscure their conscious and their natural instinct. How can we dispel
> this ignorance and destroy these harmful prejudices? By education and
> propaganda? . . . they are insufficient . . . [and] who will conduct
> this propaganda? . . . [The] workers' world . . . is left with but a
> single path, that of **emancipation through practical action** . . .
> It means workers' solidarity in their struggle against the bosses. It
> means **trade-unions, organisation** . . . To deliver [the worker]
> from that ignorance [of reactionary ideas], the International relies
> on collective experience he gains in its bosom, especially on the
> progress of the collective struggle of the workers against the bosses
> . . . As soon as he begins to take an active part in this wholly
> material struggle, . . . Socialism replaces religion in his mind. . .
> through practice and collective experience . . . the progressive and
> development of the economic struggle will bring him more and more to
> recognise his true enemies . . . The workers thus enlisted in the
> struggle will necessarily . . . recognise himself to be a
> revolutionary socialist, and he will act as one."* [**The Basic
> Bakunin**, p. 102-3]

Therefore anarchists are well aware of the importance of struggle and
propaganda in winning people to anarchist ideas. No anarchist has ever
argued otherwise.

11. Why do anarchists oppose the Leninist "revolutionary party"?
----------------------------------------------------------------

The SWP argue that:

> *"So there is always a battle of ideas within the working class. That
> is why political organisation is crucial. Socialists seek to build a
> revolutionary party not only to try to spread the lessons from one
> struggle to another.*
> "They also want to organise those people who most clearly reject
> capitalism into a force that can fight for their ideas inside the
> working class as a whole. Such a party is democratic because its
> members constantly debate what is happening in today's struggles and
> the lessons that can be applied from past ones."

That, in itself, is something most anarchists would agree with. That is
why they build specific anarchist organisations which discuss and debate
politics, current struggles, past struggles and revolutions and so on.
In Britain there are three national anarchist federations (the Anarchist
Federation, the Solidarity Federation and the Class War Federation) as
well as numerous local groups and regional federations. The aim of these
organisations is to try and influence the class struggle towards
anarchist ideas (and, equally important, **learn** from that struggle as
well -- the *"program of the Alliance [Bakunin's anarchist group],
expanded to keep pace with developing situations."* [Bakunin, **Bakunin
on Anarchism**, p. 406]). The need for a specific political organisation
is one most anarchists would agree with.

Thus few anarchists are believers in spontaneous revolution and see the
need for anarchists to organise **as anarchists** to spread anarchist
ideas and push the struggle towards anarchist ends (smashing the state
and capitalism and the creation of a free federation of workers'
councils and communes) via anarchist tactics (direct action, solidarity,
general strikes, insurrection and encouraging working class
self-organisation and self-management). Hence the need for specific
anarchist organisations:

> *"The Alliance [Bakunin's anarchist group] is the necessary complement
> to the International [the revolutionary workers' movement]. But the
> International and the Alliance, while having the same ultimate aims,
> perform different functions. The International endeavours to unify the
> working masses . . . regardless of nationality and national boundaries
> or religious and political beliefs, into one compact body; the
> Alliance . . . tries to give these masses a really revolutionary
> direction. The programs of one and the other, without being opposed,
> differ in the degree of their revolutionary development. The
> International contains in germ, but only in germ, the whole program of
> the Alliance. The program of the Alliance represents the fullest
> unfolding of the International."* [**Bakunin on Anarchism**, p. 157]

However, anarchists also argue that the revolutionary organisation must
also reflect the type of society we want. Hence an anarchist federation
must be self-organised from below, rejecting hierarchy and embracing
self-management. For anarchists an organisation is not democratic
because it debates, as the SWP claims. It is democratic only if the
membership actually decides the policy of the organisation. That the SWP
fail to mention this is significant and places doubt on whether their
organisation is democratic in fact (as we indicate in [section
22](append34.html#app22), the SWP may debate but it is not democratic).
The reason why democracy in the SWP may not be all that it should be can
be found in their comment that:

> *"It is also centralised, as it arrives at decisions which everyone
> acts on."*

However, this is not centralisation. Centralisation is when the centre
decides everything and the membership follow those orders. That the
membership may be in a position to elect those at the centre does not
change the fact that the membership is simply expected to follow orders.
It is the organisational principle of the army or police, not of a free
society. That this is the principle of Leninism can be seen from
Trotsky's comment that the *"statues [of the party] should express the
leadership's organised distrust of the members, a distrust manifesting
itself in vigilant control from above over the Party."* [quoted by M.
Brinton, **The Bolsheviks and Workers' Control**, p. xi] Thus the centre
controls the membership, not vice versa.

In **What is to be Done?** Lenin discussed *"the confusion of ideas
concerning the meaning of democracy."* He dismisses the idea of
self-management as *"Primitive Democracy."* He uses the example of the
early British unions, where workers *"thought that it was an
indispensable sign of democracy for all the members to do all the work
of managing the unions; not only were all questions decided by the vote
of all the members, but all the official duties were fulfilled by all
the members in turn."* He considered *"such a conception of democracy"*
as *"absurd"* and saw it as historical necessity that it was replaced by
*"representative institutions"* and *"full-time officials"*.
[**Essential Works of Lenin**, pp. 162-3] In other words, the Leninist
tradition rejects self-management in favour of hierarchical structures
in which power is centralised in the hands of *"full-time officials"*
and *"representative institutions."*

In contrast, Bakunin argued that trade unions which ended *"primitive
democracy"* and replaced it with representative institutions became
bureaucratic and *"simply left all decision-making to their committees .
. . In this manner power gravitated to the committees, and by a species
of fiction characteristic of all governments the committees substituted
their own will and their own ideas for that of the membership."* The
membership become subject to *"the arbitrary power"* of the committees
and *"ruled by oligarchs."* In other words, bureaucracy set in and
democracy **as such** was eliminated and while *"very good for the
committees . . . [it was] not at all favourable for the social,
intellectual, and moral progress of the collective power"* of the
workers' movement. [**Bakunin on Anarchism**, pp. 246-7] Who was correct
can quickly be seen from the radical and pro-active nature of the
British trade union leadership. Ironically, the SWP always bemoan trade
union bureaucracies betraying workers in struggle yet promote an
organisational structure that ensures that power flows to the centre and
into the hands of bureaucrats.

At best, Leninism reduces "democracy" to mean that the majority
designates its rulers, copied from the model of bourgeois parliamentary
democracy. In practice it is drained of any real meaning and quickly
becomes a veil thrown over the unlimited power of the rulers. The base
does not run the organisation just because once a year it elects
delegates who designate the central committee, no more than the people
are sovereign in a parliamentary-type republic because they periodically
elect deputies who designate the government. That the central committee
is designated by a "democratically elected" congress makes no difference
once it is elected, it is de facto and de jure the absolute ruler of the
organisation. It has complete (statutory) control over the body of the
Party (and can dissolve the base organisations, kick out militants,
etc.).

Therefore it is ironic that the SWP promote themselves as supporters of
democracy as it is anarchists who support the *"primitive democracy"*
(self-management) contemptuously dismissed by Lenin. With their calls
for centralisation, it is clear that SWP still follow Lenin, wishing to
place decision-making at the centre of the organisation, in the hands of
leaders, in the same way the police, army and bureaucratic trade unions
do. Anarchists reject this vision as non-socialist and instead argue for
the fullest participation in decision making by those subject to those
decisions. Only in this way can government -- inequality in power -- be
eliminated from society.

Just to stress the point, anarchists are not opposed to people making
decisions and everyone who took part in making the decision acting on
them. Such a system is not "centralised," however, when the decisions
flow from the bottom-up and are made by mandated delegates, accountable
to the people who mandated them. It is centralised when it is decided
upon by the leadership and imposed upon the membership. Thus the issue
is not whether we organise or not organise, nor whether we co-ordinate
joint activity or not, it is a question of how we organise and
co-ordinate -- from the bottom up or from the top down. As Bakunin
argued:

> *"Discipline, mutual trust as well as unity are all excellent
> qualities when properly understood and practised, but disastrous when
> abused . . . [one use of the word] discipline almost always signifies
> despotism on the one hand and blind automatic submission to authority
> on the other. . .*
>
> "Hostile as I am to [this,] the authoritarian conception of
> discipline, I nevertheless recognise that a certain kind of
> discipline, not automatic but voluntary and intelligently understood
> is, and will ever be, necessary whenever a greater number of
> individuals undertake any kind of collective work or action. Under
> these circumstances, discipline is simply the voluntary and considered
> co-ordination of all individual efforts for a common purpose. At the
> moment of revolution, in the midst of the struggle, there is a natural
> division of functions according to the aptitude of each, assessed and
> judged by the collective whole. . .
>
> "In such a system, power, properly speaking, no longer exists. Power
> is diffused to the collectivity and becomes the true expression of the
> liberty of everyone, the faithful and sincere realisation of the will
> of all . . . this is the only true discipline, the discipline
> necessary for the organisation of freedom. This is not the kind of
> discipline preached by the State . . . which wants the old,
> routine-like, automatic blind discipline. Passive discipline is the
> foundation of every despotism." [**Bakunin on Anarchism**, pp. 414-5]

Therefore, anarchists see the need to make agreements, to stick by them
and to show discipline but we argue that this must be to the agreements
we helped to make and subject to our judgement. We reject
"centralisation" as it confuses the necessity of agreement with
hierarchical power, of solidarity and agreement from below with unity
imposed from above as well as the need for discipline with following
orders.

12. Why do the SWP make a polemical fetish of *"unity"* and *"democracy"* to the expense of common sense and freedom?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The SWP argue that *"unity"* is essential:

> *"Without unity around decisions there would be no democracy -
> minorities would simply ignore majority decisions."*

Anarchists are in favour of free agreement and so argue that minorities
should, in general, go along with the majority decisions of the groups
and federations they are members of. That is, after all, the point
behind federalism -- to co-ordinate activity. Minorities can, after all,
leave an association. As Malatesta argued, *"anarchists recognise that
where life is lived in common it is often necessary for the minority to
come to accept the opinion of the majority. When there is an obvious
need or usefulness in doing something and, to do it requires the
agreement of all, the few should feel the need adapt to the wishes of
the many."* [**The Anarchist Revolution**, p. 100] The Spanish C.N.T.
argued in its vision of Libertarian Communism that:

> *"Communes are to be autonomous and will be federated at regional and
> national levels for the purpose of achieving goals of a general
> nature. . . . communes . . . will undertake to adhere to whatever
> general norms [that] may be majority vote after free debate. . . The
> inhabitants of a Commune are to debate their internal problems . . .
> among themselves. Whenever problems affecting an entire comarca
> [district] or province are involved, it must be the Federations [of
> communes] who deliberate and at every reunion or assembly these may
> hold all of the Communes are to be represented and their delegates
> will relay the viewpoints previously approved in their respective
> Communes . . . On matters of a regional nature, it will be up to the
> Regional Federation to put agreements into practice and these
> agreements will represent the sovereign will of all the region's
> inhabitants. So the starting point is the individual, moving on
> through the Commune, to the Federation and right on up finally to the
> Confederation."* [quoted by Jose Pierats, **The C.N.T. in the Spanish
> Revolution**, pp. 68-9]

Therefore, as a general rule-of-thumb, anarchists have little problem
with the minority accepting the decisions of the majority after a
process of free debate and discussion. As we argue in [section
A.2.11](secA2.html#seca211), such collective decision making is
compatible with anarchist principles -- indeed, is based on them. By
governing ourselves directly, we exclude others governing us. However,
we do not make a fetish of this, recognising that, in certain
circumstances, the minority must and should ignore majority decisions.
For example, if the majority of an organisation decide on a policy which
the minority thinks is disastrous then why should they follow the
majority? In 1914, the representatives of the German Social Democratic
Party voted for war credits. The anti-war minority of that group went
along with the majority in the name of *"democracy,"* *"unity"* and
*"discipline"*. Would the SWP argue that they were right to do so?
Similarly, if a majority of a community decided, say, that homosexuals
were to be arrested, would the SWP argue that minorities must not ignore
that decision? We hope not.

In general, anarchists would argue that a minority should ignore the
majority when their decisions violate the fundamental ideas which the
organisation or association are built on. In other words, if the
majority violates the ideals of liberty, equality and solidarity then
the minority can and should reject the decisions of the majority. So, a
decision of the majority that violates the liberty of a non-oppressive
minority -- say, restricting their freedom of association -- then
minorities can and should ignore the decisions and practice civil
disobedience to change that decision. Similarly, if a decision violates
the solidarity and the feelings of equality which should inform
decisions, then, again, the minority should reject the decision. We
cannot accept majority decisions without question simply because the
majority can be wrong. Unless the minority can judge the decisions of
the majority and can reject them then they are slaves of the majority
and the equality essential for a socialist society is eliminated in
favour of mere obedience.

However, if the actions of the majority are simply considered to be
disastrous but breaking the agreement would weaken the actions of the
majority, then solidarity should be the overwhelming consideration. As
Malatesta argued, *"[t]here are matters over which it is worth accepting
the will of the majority because the damage caused by a split would be
greater than that caused by error; there are circumstances in which
discipline becomes a duty because to fail in it would be to fail in the
solidarity between the oppressed and would mean betrayal in face of the
enemy . . . What is essential is that individuals should develop a sense
of organisation and solidarity, and the conviction that fraternal
co-operation is necessary to fight oppression and to achieve a society
in which everyone will be able to enjoy his [or her] own life."* [**Life
and Ideas**, pp. 132-3]

He stresses the point:

> *"But such an adaptation [of the minority to the decisions of the
> majority] on the one hand by one group must be reciprocal, voluntary
> and must stem from an awareness of need and of goodwill to prevent the
> running of social affairs from being paralysed by obstinacy. It cannot
> be imposed as a principle and statutory norm. . .*
> "So . . . anarchists deny the right of the majority to govern in human
> society in general . . . how is it possible . . . to declare that
> anarchists should submit to the decisions of the majority before they
> have even heard what those might be?" [**The Anarchist Revolution**,
> pp. 100-1]

Therefore, while accepting majority decision making as a key aspect of a
revolutionary movement and a free society, anarchists do not make a
fetish of it. We recognise that we must use our own judgement in
evaluating each decision reached simply because the majority is not
always right. We must balance the need for solidarity in the common
struggle and needs of common life with critical analysis and judgement.

Needless to say, our arguments apply with even more force to the
decisions of the **representatives** of the majority, who are in
practice a very small minority. Leninists usually try and confuse these
two distinct forms of decision making. When groups like the SWP discuss
majority decision making they almost always mean the decisions of those
elected by the majority -- the central committee or the government --
rather than the majority of the masses or an organisation.

So, in practice the SWP argue that the majority of an organisation
cannot be consulted on every issue and so what they actually mean is
that the decisions of the central committee (or government) should be
followed at all times. In other words, the decisions of a minority (the
leaders) should be obeyed by the majority. A minority owns and controls
the "revolutionary" organisation and "democracy" is quickly turned into
its opposite. Very "democratic."

As we shall indicate in the next two sections, the SWP do not, in fact,
actually follow their own arguments. They are quite happy for minorities
to ignore majority decisions -- as long as the minority in question is
the leadership of their own parties. As we argue in [section
14](append34.html#app14), such activities flow naturally from the
vanguardist politics of Leninism and should not come as a surprise.

13. How does the Battle of Prague expose the SWP as hypocrites?
---------------------------------------------------------------

To evaluate the sincerity of the SWP's proclaimed commitment to
*"democracy"* and *"centralism"* we just have to look at the actions of
their contingent at the demonstration against the WTO and IMF in Prague
on September 26th, 2000.

Let us recall that on September 16th, the SWP had argued as follows:

> *"It is no good people coming together in a struggle, discussing what
> to do and then doing just what they feel like as if no discussion had
> taken place."*

They stressed that importance of *"centralisation"* which they defined
as *"arriv[ing] at decisions which everyone acts on. Without unity
around decisions there would be no democracy -- minorities would simply
ignore majority decisions."*

In practice, the International Socialist (IS) section of the Prague
demonstration (the SWP and its sister parties) totally ignored their own
arguments. Instead of ending up in the Pink sector (for which they had
put themselves down) they somehow ended up behind *"Ya Basta"* in the
yellow sector. As they were at the front of the march this should have
been impossible. It turns out they deliberately entered the wrong sector
because they refused to accept the agreed plan to split the march in
three.

The protests had been co-ordinated by INPEG. INPEG was established as a
democratic implement of communication and co-ordination among
individuals and groups which want to protest against the annual summit
of IMF in Prague on September 2000. It included a variety groups -- for
instance reformists (e.g. NESEHNUTI), anarchists (e.g. CSAF or
Solidarity) and Leninists (i.e. Socialist Solidarity, sister
organisation of the British SWP). The IS group had argued at INPEG
committee meetings earlier in the year for a single march on the centre
(which of course could not have shut the conference down). They failed
to win this argument and so had betrayed the rest of the protesters on
the day by simply marching directly onto the bridge themselves (in the
yellow sector) instead of continuing into the Pink sector as they were
supposed to.

Why did the SWP do what they did? Presumably they put themselves down
for the Pink section because it was at the front of the march and so
offered the best media coverage for their placards and banners.
Similarly, they joined the Yellow Section because it was marching
directly to the conference centre and not, like Pink, going round to the
rear and so, again, offered the best media coverage. In other words,
they *"did their own thing"*, ignored the agreements they made and
weakened the protests simply to look the dominant group in the press.
Ironically, the Czech media made sure that the Leninist parties got onto
their front pages simply because many of them chose to march in Prague
with red flags emblazoned with hammer and sickles. Flags associated with
the Soviet occupation and the old regime are hardly "popular" and so
useful to smear the protests.

The decision of the SWP to ignore the agreed plan was applauded by other
Leninists. According to the post-Prague issue of the Communist Party of
Great Britain's paper **Weekly Worker**:

> *"Farcically, the organisers had decided to split the march into
> three, each with its own route and composition -- blue (anarchist),
> pink (trade unions and left organisations) and yellow (NGOs and
> Jubilee 2000). Ostensibly, this started as a tactic designed to
> facilitate forming a human chain around the conference centre,
> although by the day of the action this aim had, apparently, been
> abandoned. Whether these truly stupid arrangements had been accepted
> beforehand by all on the INPEG (Initiative Against Economic
> Globalisation) remains hazy, given the paucity of information about
> the debates and differences on this self-appointed body."*

The splitting of the march into three, as a matter of fact, was a great
success. It allowed the demonstrators to encircle the conference centre.
The marches splitting off from the back working beautifully, catching
the police and media by surprise who were clustered at the front of the
march (indeed, the police later admitted that they had been caught off
guard by the splitting of the march). From the splitting points to the
centre the marches were unaccompanied by both police and media. A clear
victory. Indeed, what would have been *"truly stupid"* was doing what
the police had expected (and SWP wanted) -- to have one big march.

How was the demonstration's organised? According to eye-witness
Katharine Viner (writing in **The Guardian** on Friday September 29,
2000):

> *"In the run-up to Tuesday's demonstration I attended the convergence
> centre, where 'spokes council' meetings took place, and found the
> sense of community and organisation there astonishing and moving.
> Every 'affinity group' - NGO or group of friends - sent a spokesperson
> to meetings to make decisions and work out strategy. It sounds
> impossible to contain, and it was laborious, but it worked and
> consensus was found. It felt like proper democracy in a way that the
> ballot box does not."*

Julie Light, of **Corporate Watch**, indicates the same process at work
in her account entitled **Spirits, Tensions Run High in Prague** (dated
September 25, 2000):

> *"the activist coalition called the Initiative Against Economic
> Globalisation (INPEG) is training hundreds of people in civil
> disobedience at the Convergence Centre. The Centre, a converted
> warehouse space located under Prague's Libensky Bridge, serves as an
> information and strategy clearinghouse for the protesters. A 'spokes
> council' made up of representatives of dozens of groups makes
> decisions by consensus for this international ad-hoc coalition that
> has never worked together before. They have an elaborate system of
> hand signals to indicate their views as they discuss the details of
> the protests. Given the logistical obstacles, things seem to be
> running remarkably smoothly."*

Obviously *"proper democracy"* and a council of group spokespeople
discussing the protests were not good enough for the SWP and other
Leninist groups. Nor, of course, making an agreement and sticking to it.

The **Weekly Worker** complements the SWP's decision:

> *"Come the march itself, the damage was partially repaired by the
> decision of a majority of the 'pink' contingent (with the SWP and its
> international sections to the fore) to simply veer off the agreed
> route. This pink section then partially merged with the yellow to
> advance on the conference."*

We must point out that the International Socialist appear to have lied
about the numbers they were bringing to Prague. The day before the
demonstration they claimed they said they would contribute 2,500 to the
Pink section -- since then their own press has reported 1,000 in their
delegation (**Socialist Worker** no. 1716 stated that the *"day began
when over 1,000 marched from the Florenc bus station . . .led by
supporters of Socialist Worker and its sister papers elsewhere in
Europe"*). This would have left the Pink block seriously under strength
even if they had not unilaterally left their block.

Their defection from the agreed plan had very serious repercussions on
the day -- one gate in the Pink sector was never covered. In the Blue
sector, where the anarchists were concentrated, this meant that at the
height of a battle with hundreds of riot police, a water cannon and two
Armoured Personnel Carriers they were forced to send 300 people on a 2
km hike to attempt to close this gate. Shortly after they left a police
charge broke the Blue Block lines leading to arrests and injuries.

Thus, by ignoring the plan and doing their own thing, they not only made
a mockery of their own arguments and the decision making process of the
demonstration, weakened the protest and placed others in danger.

And the net effect of their defection? As the **Weekly Worker**
pathetically comments:

> *"Of course, it was blocked by ranks of riot police . . ."*

As the bridge was a very narrow front this resulted in a huge amount of
people stuck behind *"Ya Basta!"* with nothing to do except sit around.
So the "International Socialists" and other Leninists who undertook the
act of sabotage with them were stuck doing nothing behind *"Ya Basta"*
at the bottom of the bridge (as would be expected -- indeed, this
exposes another failing of centralism, its inability to know local
circumstances, adapt to them and plan taking them into account). The
tiny number of anarchists who marched around to cover their gate on the
other hand, took the police by surprise and broke through to the
conference centre until driven back by hundreds of riot police. Worse,
there were some problems in the "Yellow Block" as the Leninists were
pushing from behind and it took some serious explaining to get them to
understand that they should stop it because otherwise people in the
front line could be crushed to death. Moreover, they demanded to be
allowed up alongside *"Ya Basta"* at the front, next to the riot cops,
but when *"Ya Basta"* did pull out and invited the SWP to take their
place in the front they refused to do so.

Moreover, the actual result of the SWP's disgraceful actions in Prague
also indicates the weakness of centralism. Having centrally decided to
have one big march (regardless of what the others thought or the
majority wished or agreed to) the decision was made with clearly no idea
of the local geography otherwise they would have known that the front at
the bridge would have been small. The net result of the "efficient"
centralisation of the SWP? A mass of protestors stuck doing nothing due
to a lack of understanding of local geography and the plan to blockade
the conference seriously weakened. A federal organisation, on the other
hand, would have had information from the local activists who would have
been organising the protests and made their plans accordingly.

Therefore, to summarise. Ten days after denouncing anarchism for
refusing to accept majority decisions and for being against
"centralisation" (i.e. making and keeping agreements), the SWP ignore
majority decisions, break agreements and do their own thing. Not only
that, they weaken the demonstration and place their fellow protestors in
difficulties simply so they could do nothing someplace else as,
unsurprisingly enough, their way was blocked by riot cops. An amazing
example of "democratic centralism" in practice and sure to inspire us
all to follow the path of Marxism-Leninism!

The hypocrisy of their actions and arguments are clear. The question now
arises, what do anarchists think of their action. As we argued in the
[last section](append34.html#app12), while anarchists favour direct
democracy (self-management) when making decisions we also accept that
minorities can and should ignore a majority decision if that decision is
considered to be truly disastrous. However, any such decision must be
made based on evaluating the damage caused by so making it and whether
it would be a violation of solidarity to do so. This is what the SWP
clearly failed to do. Their decision not only made a mockery of their
own argument, it failed to take into account **solidarity** with the
rest of the demonstration.

From an anarchist perspective, therefore, the SWP's decision and actions
cannot be justified. They violated the basic principles of a
revolutionary movement, the principles of liberty, equality and
solidarity. They ignored the liberty of others by violating their
agreements with them, they violated their equality by acting as if the
other groups ideas and decisions did not matter and they violated
solidarity by ignoring the needs of the common struggle and so placing
their fellow demonstrators in danger. While anarchists **do** respect
the rights of minorities to act as they see fit, we also recognise the
importance of solidarity with our fellow workers and protestors. The SWP
by failing to consider the needs of the common struggle sabotaged the
demonstration and should be condemned not only as hypocrites but also as
elitists -- the party is not subject to the same rules as other
demonstrators, whose wishes are irrelevant when they conflict with the
party. The implications for the SWP's proclaimed support for democracy
is clear.

So it appears that minorities **can** and **should** ignore agreements
-- as long as the minority in question are the leaders of the SWP and
its sister parties. They have exposed themselves as being hypocrites.
Like their heroes, Lenin and Trotsky, they will ignore democratic
decisions when it suits them (see [next section](append34.html#app14)).
This is sickening for numerous reasons -- it placed the rest of the
demonstrators in danger, it weakened the demonstration itself and it
shows that the SWP say one thing and do the exact opposite. They, and
the political tradition they are part of, clearly are not to be trusted.
The bulk of the membership went along with this betrayal like sheep.
Hardly a good example of revolutionary consciousness. In fact it shows
that the "revolutionary" discipline of the SWP **is** like that of the
cops or army) and that SWP's centralised system **is** based on
typically bourgeois notions. In other words, the organisational
structure desired by the SWP does not encourage the autonomy, initiative
or critical thinking of its members (as anarchists have long argued).

Prague shows that their arguments for "centralisation" as necessary for
"democracy" are hypocrisy and amount to little more than a call for
domination by the SWP's leadership over the anti-capitalist movement --
a call hidden begin the rhetoric of "democracy." As can be seen, in
practice the SWP happily ignores democracy when it suits them. The party
always comes first, regardless of what the people it claims to represent
actually want. In this they follow the actions of the Bolsheviks in
power (see [next section](append34.html#app14)). Little wonder
Marxism-Leninism is dying -- the difference between what they claim and
what they do is becoming increasingly well know.

14. Is the Leninist tradition actually as democratic as the SWP like to claim?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

While the SWP attack anarchism for being undemocratic for being against
"centralism" the truth is that the Leninist tradition is fundamentally
undemocratic. Those, like the SWP, who are part of the Bolshevik
tradition have no problem with minorities ignoring majority decisions --
as long as the minority in question is the leadership of the vanguard
party. We discussed the example of the *"battle of Prague"* in the [last
section](append34.html#app13), now we turn to Bolshevism in power during
the Russian Revolution.

For example, the Bolsheviks usually overthrew the results of provincial
soviet elections that went against them [Samuel Farber, **Before
Stalinism**, pp 22-24]. It was in the spring of 1918 that the Bolsheviks
showed how little they really supported the soviets. As discontent grew
soviet after soviet fell to Menshevik-SR blocs. To stay in power they
had to destroy the soviets and they did. Opposition victories were
followed by disbanding of the soviets and often martial law. [Vladimir
Brovkin, *"The Menshevik's Political Comeback: The elections to the
provincial soviets in spring 1918"*, **Russian Review** no. 42 (1983),
pp. 1-50]

In addition, the Bolsheviks abolished by decree soldiers' councils and
the election of officers in the Red Army in favour of officers appointed
from above (see [section 11](append32.html#app11) of the appendix
[*"Marxism and Spanish Anarchism"*](append32.html) for details). They
replaced self-managed factory committees with appointed, autocratic
managers (see M. Brinton's **The Bolsheviks and Workers Control** or
[section 17](append32.html#app17) of the appendix [*"Marxism and Spanish
Anarchism"*](append32.html) for details). All this before the start of
the Russian Civil War. Similarly, Lenin and Trotsky happily replaced the
democratically elected leaders of trade unions with their followers when
it suited them.

As Trotsky argued in 1921, you cannot place *"the workers' right to
elect representatives above the party. As if the Party were not entitled
to assert its dictatorship even if that dictatorship clashed with the
passing moods of the workers' democracy!"* He continued by stating the
*"Party is obliged to maintain its dictatorship . . . regardless of
temporary vacillations even in the working class . . . The dictatorship
does not base itself at every moment on the formal principle of a
workers' democracy."* [quoted by M. Brinton, **The Bolsheviks and
Workers' Control**, p. 78]

Of course, such a position follows naturally from Lenin's theory from
**What is to be Done?** that *"the working class, exclusively by their
own effort, is able to develop only trade union consciousness . . . The
theory of socialism [i.e. Marxism], however, grew out of the
philosophic, historical and economic theories that were elaborated by
the educated representatives of the propertied classes, the
intellectuals . . . the theoretical doctrine of Social-Democracy arose
quite independently of the spontaneous growth of the labour movement; it
arose as a natural and inevitable outcome of ideas among the
revolutionary socialist intelligentsia."* This meant that *"Social
Democratic [i.e. socialist] consciousness . . . could only be brought to
them from without."* [**Essential Lenin**, pp. 74-5]

For Leninists, if the workers' act in ways opposed to by the party, then
the party has the right to ignore, even repress, the workers -- they
simply do not (indeed, cannot) understand what is required of them. They
cannot reach *"socialist consciousness"* by their own efforts -- indeed,
their opinions can be dismissed as *"there can be no talk of an
independent ideology being developed by the masses of the workers in the
process of their movement **the only choice is**: either bourgeois or
socialist ideology . . . to belittle socialist ideology **in any way**,
to **deviate from it in the slightest degree** means strengthening
bourgeois ideology . . . the **spontaneous** development of the labour
movement leads to it becoming subordinated to bourgeois ideology."*
[**Op. Cit.**, p. 82] Given that the socialist ideology cannot be
communicated without the vanguard party, this means that the **party**
can ignore the wishes of the masses simply because such wishes **must
be** influenced by "bourgeois" ideology. Thus Leninism contains within
itself the justification for eliminating democracy within the
revolution. From Lenin's arguments to Bolshevik actions during the
revolution and Trotsky's assertions in 1921 is only a matter of time --
and **power**.

In other words, the SWP's *"Battle of Ideas"* becomes, once the vanguard
is in power, just a battle:

> *"Without revolutionary coercion directed against the avowed enemies
> of the workers and peasants, it is impossible to break down the
> resistance of these exploiters. On the other hand, revolutionary
> coercion is bound to be employed towards the wavering and unstable
> elements among the masses themselves."* [Lenin, **Collected Works**,
> vol. 24, p. 170]

Significantly, of the 17 000 camp detainees on whom statistical
information was available on 1 November 1920, peasants and workers
constituted the largest groups, at 39% and 34% respectively. Similarly,
of the 40 913 prisoners held in December 1921 (of whom 44% had been
committed by the Cheka) nearly 84% were illiterate or minimally
educated, clearly, therefore, either peasants of workers. [George
Leggett, **The Cheka: Lenin's Political Police**, p. 178] Needless to
say, Lenin failed to mention this aspect of his system in **The State
and Revolution**, as do the SWP in their article.

It is hard to combine these facts and the SWP's comments with the claim
that the "workers' state" is an instrument of class rule -- after all,
Lenin is acknowledging that coercion will be exercised against members
of the working class as well. The question of course arises -- who
decides what a *"wavering"* or *"unstable"* element is? Given their
comments on the role of the party and the need for the party to assume
power, it will mean in practice whoever rejects the government's
decisions (for example, strikers, local soviets which reject central
decrees and instructions, workers who vote for anarchists or parties
other than the Bolshevik party in elections to soviets, unions and so
on, socialists and anarchists, etc.). Given a hierarchical system,
Lenin's comment is simply a justification for state repression of its
enemies (including elements within, or even the whole of, the working
class).

It could be argued, however, that workers could use the soviets to
recall the government. However, this fails for two reasons.

Firstly, the Leninist state will be highly centralised, with power
flowing from the top-down. This means that in order to revoke the
government, all the soviets in all parts of the country must, at the
same time, recall their delegates and organise a national congress of
soviets (which, we note, is not in permanent session). The local soviets
are bound to carry out the commands of the central government (to quote
the Soviet constitution of 1918 -- they are to *"carry out all orders of
the respective higher organs of the soviet power"*). Any independence on
their part would be considered *"wavering"* or an expression of
*"unstable"* natures and so subject to *"revolutionary coercion"*. In a
highly centralised system, the means of accountability is reduced to the
usual bourgeois level -- vote in the general election every few years
(which, in any case, can be annulled by the government if its dislikes
the *"passing moods"* expressed by them). As can be seen above, the
Bolsheviks did disband soviets when they considered the wrong (i.e.
*"wavering"* or *"unstable"*) elements had been elected to them and so a
highly centralised state system cannot be responsive to real control
from below.

Secondly, *"revolutionary coercion"* against *"wavering"* elements does
not happen in isolation. It will encourage critical workers to keep
quiet in case they, too, are deemed *"unstable"* and become subject to
*"revolutionary"* coercion. As a government policy it can have no other
effect than deterring democracy.

Thus Leninist politics provides the rationale for eliminating even the
limited role of soviets for electing the government they hold in that
ideology. The Leninist conception of workers' councils is purely
instrumental. In 1907, Lenin argued that:

> *"the Party . . . has never renounced its intention of utilising
> certain non-party organisations, such as the Soviets of Workers'
> Deputies . . . to extend Social-Democratic influence among the working
> class and to strengthen the Social-Democratic labour movement . . .
> the incipient revival creates the opportunity to organise or utilise
> non-party working-class institutions, such as Soviets . . . for the
> purpose of developing the Social-Democratic movement; at the same time
> the Social-Democratic Party organisations must bear in mind if
> Social-Democratic activities among the proletarian masses are
> properly, effectively and widely organised, such institutions may
> actually become superfluous."* [Marx, Engels and Lenin, **Anarchism
> and Anarcho-Syndicalism**, pp. 209-10]

As can be seen from the experiences of Russia under Lenin, this
perspective did not fundamentally change -- given a conflict between the
councils and the party, the party always came first and soviets simply
superfluous.

15. Why is the SWP's support for centralisation anti-socialist?
---------------------------------------------------------------

The SWP continue:

> *"Centralism is needed above all because the capitalist state is
> centralised. The police, media moguls, employers, the state
> bureaucracy and governments act in a concerted way to protect the
> system."*

Very true. However, the SWP fail to analyse ***why*** the state is
centralised. Simply put, the state is centralised to **facilitate
minority rule** by excluding the mass of people from taking part in the
decision making processes within society. This is to be expected as
social structures do not evolve by chance -- rather they develop to meet
specific needs and requirements. The specific need of the ruling class
is to rule and that means marginalising the bulk of the population. Its
requirement is for minority power and this is transformed into the
structure of the state and capitalist company. The SWP assume that
centralisation is simply a tool without content. Rather, it is a tool
that has been fashioned to do a specific job, namely to exclude the bulk
of the population from the decision making process. It is designed that
way and can have no other result. For that reason anarchists reject
centralisation. As the justly famous Sonvillier Circular argued: *"How
could one expect an egalitarian society to emerge out of an
authoritarian organisation? It is impossible."* [quoted by Brian Morris,
**Bakunin: The Philosophy of Freedom**, p. 61]

Thus Rudolf Rocker:

> *"For the state centralisation is the appropriate form of
> organisation, since it aims at the greatest possible uniformity in
> social life for the maintenance of political and social equilibrium.
> But for a movement whose very existence depends on prompt action at
> any favourable moment and on the independent thought and action of its

> vital initiative of its members and sets up that domination by
> mediocrity which is the characteristic of all bureaucracies."*
> [**Anarcho-Syndicalism**, p. 54]

Just as the capitalist state cannot be utilised by the working class for
its own ends, capitalist/statist organisational principles such as
appointment, autocratic management, centralisation and delegation of
power and so on cannot be utilised for social liberation. They are not
designed to be used for that purpose (and, indeed, they were developed
in the first place to stop it and enforce minority rule!).

The implication of the SWP's argument is that centralisation is required
for co-ordinated activity. Anarchists disagree. Yes, there is a need for
co-ordination and joint activity, but that must be created from below,
in new ways that reflect the goals we are aiming for. During the Spanish
Revolution anarchists organised militias to fight the fascists. One was
lead by anarchist militant Durruti. His military adviser, Pérez Farras,
a professional soldier, was concerned about the application of
libertarian principles to military organisation. Durruti replied:

> *"I have already said and I repeat; during all my life, I have acted
> as an anarchist. The fact of having been given political
> responsibility for a human collective cannot change my convictions. It
> is under these conditions that I agreed to play the role given to me

Durruti's words effectively refute the SWP's flawed argument. We need to
organise, co-ordinate, co-operate our activities but we cannot do so in
bourgeois ways. We need to discover new ways, based on libertarian ideas
and not capitalist ones like centralisation.

Indeed, this conflict between the Leninist support for traditional forms
of organisational structure and the new forms produced by workers in
struggle came into conflict during the Russian Revolution. One such area
of conflict was the factory committee movement and its attempts at
workers' self-management of production. As historian A.S. Smith
summarises:

> *"Implicit in the movement for workers' control was a belief that
> capitalist methods cannot be used for socialist ends. In their battle
> to democratise the factory, in their emphasis on the importance of
> collective initiatives by the direct producers in transforming the

> central state and lacked a conception of localising such power at the
> point of production." [**Red Petrograd**, pp. 261-2]

The outcome of this struggle was the victory of the Bolshevik vision (as
it had state power to enforce it) and the imposition of apparently
"efficient" capitalist methods of organisation. However, the net effect
of using (or, more correctly, imposing) capitalist organisations was,
unsurprisingly, the re-introduction of capitalist social relations.
Little wonder the Russian Revolution quickly became just another form of
capitalism -- ***state** capitalism where the state appointed manager
replaced the boss and the workers' position remained identical. Lenin's
attempts to centralise production simply replaced workers' power at the
point of production with that of state bureaucrats.*

We must point out the central fallacy of the SWP's argument. Essentially
they are arguing you need to fight fire with fire. They argue that the
capitalist class is centralised and so, in order to defeat them, so must
we. Unfortunately for the SWP, you do not put a fire out with fire, you
put fire out with water. Therefore, to defeat centralised system you
need decentralised social organisation. Such decentralisation is
required to include the bulk of the population in the revolutionary
struggle and does not imply isolation. A decentralised movement does not
preclude co-ordination or co-operation but that co-ordination must come
from below, based on federal structures, and not imposed from above.

So a key difference between anarchism and Marxism on how the movement
against capitalism should organise in the here and now. Anarchists argue
that it should prefigure the society we desire -- namely it should be
self-managed, decentralised, built and organised from the bottom-up in a
federal structure. This perspective can be seen from the justly famous
Sonvillier Circular:

> *"The future society should be nothing but a universalisation of the
> organisation which the International will establish for itself. We
> must therefore take care to bring this organisation as near as
> possible to our ideal . . . How could one expect an egalitarian and
> free society to grow out of an authoritarian organisation? That is
> impossible. The International, embryo of the future human society,
> must be, from now on, the faithful image of our principles of liberty
> and federation."* [quoted by Marx, **Fictitious Splits in the
> International**]

Of course, Marx replied to this argument and, in so doing,
misrepresented the anarchist position. He argued that the Paris
Communards *"would not have failed if they had understood that the
Commune was 'the embryo of the future human society' and had cast away
all discipline and all arms -- that is, the things which must disappear
when there are no more wars!"* [**Ibid.**] Needless to say this is
simply a slander on the anarchist position. Anarchists, as the Circular
makes clear, recognise that we cannot totally reflect the future and so
the current movement can only be *"as near as possible to our ideal."*
Thus we have to do things, such as fighting the bosses, rising in
insurrection, smashing the state or defending a revolution, which we
would not have to do in a socialist society but that does not imply we
should not try and organise in a socialist way in the here and now. Such
common sense, unfortunately, is lacking in Marx who instead decided to
utter nonsense for a cheap polemical point.

Therefore, if we want a revolution which is more than just a change in
who the boss is, we must create new forms of organisation and struggle
which do not reproduce the traits of the world we are fighting. To put
out the fire of class society, we need the water of a classless society
and so we should organise in a libertarian way, building the new world
in the shell of the old.

16. Why is the SWP wrong about the A16 Washington D.C. demo?
------------------------------------------------------------

As an example of why Marxism is better than anarchism they give an
example:

> *"Protesters put up several roadblocks during the major
> anti-capitalist demonstration in Washington in April of this year. The
> police tried to clear them. The question arose of what the protesters
> should do.*
>
> "Some wanted to try to maintain the roadblocks. Others thought the
> best tactic was to reorganise the protests into one demonstration.
> Instead of coming to a clear decision and acting on it, the key
> organiser of the whole event told people at each roadblock to do what
> they thought was right.
>
> "The resulting confusion weakened all the protests."

Firstly, we must point out that this argument is somewhat ironic coming
from a party that ignored the agreed plan during the Prague anti-WTO
demonstration and did *"what they thought was right"* (see [section
13](append34.html#app13)). Indeed, the various anti-capitalist
demonstrations have been extremely effective and have been organised in
an **anarchist** manner thus refuting the SWP.

Secondly, unfortunately for the SWP, they have the facts all wrong. The
World Bank/IMF complex in Washington DC was extremely difficult to
blockade. The police blocked over 50 blocks on the day of the
demonstration to travel. DC has very wide streets. Many World Bank and
IMF Delegates spent the night in those buildings, or came in early in
the morning long before sunrise. This calls into question whether a
blockade was the best strategy considering the logistic details involved
(the Blockade strategy was abandoned for the Republican and Democratic
Party Conference demonstrations). In addition to the blockades, there
was an officially permitted rally blocks away from the action.

The tactical process worked in practice like this. While there was an
original plan agreed to by consensus at the beginning of the blockades
by all affinity groups, with groups picking which intersection to occupy
and which tactics to use, there was a great deal of flexibility as well.
There were several flying columns that moved from intersection to
intersection reinforcing barricades and increasing numbers where it
looked like police might charge. The largest of these was the
Revolutionary Anti-Capitalist Bloc (*"the Black Bloc"*) made up mostly
of class-struggle anarchists but included a number of other left
libertarians (such as council communists and autonomists). The RACB
officially maintained its autonomy within the demonstration and worked
with others when and where it could. The affinity groups of the RACB
would come to quick decisions on what to do. Often, they would quickly
respond to the situation; usually their appearance was enough for the
cops to fall back after a few tense moments.

By early afternoon, the various affinity groups manning the blockades
were informed that the blockades had failed, and enough delegates had
made it inside that the meeting was continuing inside with only a short
delay. So the question came of what to do next? There were varying
opinions. Some affinity groups favoured maintaining their blockades
symbolically as an act of defiance and hoping to slow the dispersion of
World Bank/IMF representatives as they left the meeting. Others wished
to have a victory march around the area. Others wanted to join the
rally. Some wanted to march on the World Bank and try for an occupation.
There was no consensus. After much discussion between the affinity
groups, a decision was reached.

The RACB was divided between two choices -- either join with the rally
or march on the Bank. There was a lot of negotiation back and forth
between affinity groups. A compromise was reached. The RACB would move
to each blockade in order and provide cover for those locked down to
unlock and safely merge with the growing march so that attempts could be
made the next day do blockade. The march continued to swell as it made
its way along the route, eventually merging with the crowd at the
permitted demonstration.

A decision was made. Perhaps it wasn't the most militant. Perhaps it did
not foresee that the next day would lack the numbers to even attempt a
successful blockade. But arrests on the demonstration were kept to a
minimum, a large show of strength was put on and strong feelings of
solidarity and camaraderie grew. The cops could only control a few
square blocks, the rest of the city was ours. And it was a decision that
everyone had a part in making, and one that everyone could live with.
It's called self-management, perhaps it isn't always the fastest method
of making decisions, but it is the best one if you desire freedom.

Of course, the last thing the SWP would want to admit is that anarchists
led the victory march around Washington D.C. without a permit, without
marshals, without many arrests and a minimal amount of violence! Of all
the recent demonstrations in the U.S. the black bloc was the largest and
most well received at Washington. Moreover, that demonstration showed
that decentralised, federal organisation worked in practice. Each
affinity group participated in the decision making process and an
agreement reached between all involved. Centralisation was not required,
no centre imposed the decision. Rather than weaken the protests,
decentralisation strengthened it by involving all in the decision making
process. Little wonder the SWP re-wrote history.

17. Why does the SWP's Washington example refute the SWP's own argument and not anarchism?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

However, let us assume that the SWP's fictional account of the A16
demonstration (see [last section](append34.html#app16)) was, in fact,
true. What does it actually mean? We must point out its interesting
logic. They argue that the protests had a *"key organiser"* which means
they were centralised. They argue that the protestors looked to that
person for direction. Unfortunately that person could not come to a
*"clear decision"* and instead handed back decision making to each
roadblock. In other words, centralisation failed, not federalism.
Moreover, the state would have had a simple means to destroy the
demonstration -- arrest the *"key organiser."* In a centralised system,
without a centre, the whole structure collapses -- without someone
giving orders, nothing is done.

In a federal structure each roadblock would have sent a delegate to a
council to co-ordinate struggle (which, we stress, was what actually did
happen). To quote Bakunin, *"there will be a federation of the standing
barricades and a Revolutionary Communal Council will operate on the
basis of one or two delegates from each barricade . . . these deputies
being invested with binding mandates and accountable and revocable at
all times."* [**No Gods, No Masters**, vol. 1, p. 155] In the SWP's
version of history, the blockades did not do this and so,
unsurprisingly, without organisation, there was confusion. As an
argument against anarchism it is useless. So the SWP's fictional example
is an argument against centralisation -- of placing decision-making
power at the centre. In their story, faced with the task of
co-ordinating actions which they had no knowledge of, the *"key
organiser"* could not act and by not having a federal structure, the
roadblocks were weakened due to lack of co-ordination. In reality, a
federal structure existed within the demonstration, each roadblock and
affinity group could take effective action instantly to counter the
police, without waiting for instructions from the centre, as well as
communicate what has happening to other roadblocks and come to common
agreements on what action to take. The Washington demonstration -- like
the other anti-capitalist demonstrations -- showed the effectiveness of
anarchist principles, of decentralisation and federalism from the bottom
up.

So the SWP's analysis of the Washington demonstration is faulty on two
levels. Firstly, their account is not accurate. The demonstration was
organised in a decentralised manner and worked extremely well. Secondly,
even if their account was not fiction, it proves the failure of
centralisation, not federalism.

They draw a lesson from their fictional account:

> *"The police, needless to say, did not 'decentralise' their decision
> making. They co-ordinated across the city to break the protests."*

Such an analogy indicates the bourgeois and authoritarian nature of the
SWP's politics. They do not understand that the capitalist state and
workplace is centralised for a reason. It is to concentrate power into
the hands of a few, with the many reduced to mere order takers. It is
the means by which bourgeois rule is enforced

Moreover, they seem to be arguing that if we followed the example of the
bourgeois state, of the organisational structure of the police or the
army, then we would be as "effective" as they are. They are, in effect,
arguing that the anti-capitalist movement should reproduce the regulated
docility of the police force into its ranks, reproduce the domination of
a few bosses at the top over a mass of unquestioning automations at the
bottom. As Murray Bookchin argued, the Leninist *"has always had a
grudging admiration and respect for that most inhuman of all
hierarchical institutions, the military."* [**Toward an Ecological
Society**, p. 254f] The SWP prove him right.

18. Why is a "revolutionary party" a contradiction in terms?
------------------------------------------------------------

They continue by arguing that *"Anarchists say a revolutionary party is
at best unnecessary and at worst another form of authoritarianism. But
they cannot avoid the problems that a revolutionary party addresses."*
In reality, while anarchists reject the "revolutionary" party, they do
not reject the need for an anarchist federation to spread anarchist
ideas, convince others of our ideas and to give a lead during struggles.
We reject the Bolshevik style "revolutionary party" simply because it is
organised in a centralised, bourgeois, fashion and so produces all the
problems of capitalist society within so-called revolutionary
organisations. As the anarchists of Trotwatch explain, such a party
leaves much to be desired:

> *"In reality, a Leninist Party simply reproduces and institutionalises
> existing capitalist power relations inside a supposedly
> 'revolutionary' organisation: between leaders and led; order givers
> and order takers; between specialists and the acquiescent and largely
> powerless party workers. And that elitist power relation is extended
> to include the relationship between the party and class."* [**Carry on
> Recruiting!**, p. 41]

Such an organisation can never create a socialist society. In contrast,
anarchists argue that socialist organisations should reflect as much as
possible the future society we are aiming to create. To build
organisations which are statist/capitalistic in structure cannot do
other than reproduce the very problems of capitalism/statism into them
and so undermine their liberatory potential. As Murray Bookchin puts it:

> *"The 'glorious party,' when there is one, almost invariably lags
> behind the events . . . In the beginning . . . it tends to have an
> inhibitory function, not a 'vanguard' role. Where it exercises
> influence, it tends to slow down the flow of events, not 'co-
> ordinate' the revolutionary forced. This is not accidental. The party

Thus the example of the "successful" Russian Revolution indicates the
weakness of Leninism -- Lenin had to fight the party machine he helped
create in order to get it do anything revolutionary. Hardly a good
example of a "revolutionary" party.

But, then again, the SWP know that anarchists do not reject the need for
anarchists to organise as anarchists to influence the class struggle. As
they argue, *"Anarchism's attempts to deal with them have been far less
effective and less democratic."* The question is not of one of
**whether** revolutionaries should organise together but **how** they do
this. And as we shall see in the next four sections, the SWP's examples
of revolutionary anarchist organisations are either unique and so cannot
be generalised from (Bakunin's ideas on revolutionary organisation), or
false (the F.A.I. was **not** organised in the way the SWP claim).
Indeed, the simple fact is that the SWP **ignore** the usual ways
anarchists organise as anarchists and yet try and draw conclusions about
anarchism from their faulty examples.

19. Do anarchists operate *"in secret"*?
----------------------------------------

They continue:

> *"All the major anarchist organisations in history have been
> centralised but have operated in secret."*

It is just as well they say *"all the major anarchist organisations,"*
it allows them to ignore counter-examples. We can point to hundreds of
anarchist organisations that are/were not secret. For example, the
Italian Anarchist Union (IAU) was a non-secret organisation. Given that
the IAU had around 20 000 members in 1920, we wonder by what criteria
the SWP excludes it from being a *"major anarchist organisation"*? After
all, estimates of the membership of the F.A.I. (one of the SWP's two
*"major"* anarchist organisations) vary from around 6 000 to around 30
000. Bakunin's "Alliance" (the other SWP example) amounted to, at most,
under 100. In terms of size, the IAU was equal to the F.A.I. and
outnumbered the "Alliance" considerably. Why was the UAI not a *"major
anarchist organisation"*?

Another, more up to date, example is the French Anarchist Federation
which organises today. It as a weekly paper and groups all across France
as well as in Belgium. That is not secret and is one of the largest
anarchist organisations existing today (and so, by anyone's standards
*"a major anarchist organisation"*). We wonder why the SWP excludes it?
Simply because they know their generalisation is false?

Therefore, as can be seen, the SWP's claim is simply a lie. Few
anarchist organisations have been secret. Those that have been secret
have done so when conditions demanded it (for example, during periods of
repression and when operating in countries with authoritarian
governments). Just as Marxist organisations have done. For example, the
Bolsheviks were secret for great periods of time under Tsarism and,
ironically enough, the Trotskyist-Zinovievist **United Opposition** had
to resort to secret and conspiratorial organisation to reach the Russian
Communist Party rank and file in the 1920s. Therefore, to claim that
anarchists have some sort of monopoly of secret organising is simply a
lie -- Marxists, like anarchists, have sometimes organised in secret
when they have been forced to by state repression or likelihood of state
repression. It is not a principle but, rather, sometimes a necessity. As
anyone with even a basic grasp of anarchist history would know.

Similarly for the SWP's claims that *"all the major anarchist
organisations in history have been centralised."* Such a claim is also a
lie, as we shall prove in the sections [20](append34.html#app20) and
[22](append34.html#app22).

20. Why is the SWP wrong about Bakunin's organisation?
------------------------------------------------------

As an example of a *"major anarchist organisation"* the SWP point to
Bakunin and the organisations he created:

> *"The 19th century theorist of anarchism Mikhail Bakunin's
> organisation had a hierarchy of committees, with half a dozen people
> at the top, which were not under the democratic control of its
> members."*

Firstly, we have to wonder why anyone would have wanted to join
Bakunin's group if they had no say in the organisation. Also, given that
communication in the 19th century was extremely slow, such an
organisation would have spent most of its time waiting for instructions
from above. Why would anyone want to join such a group? Simple logic
undermines the SWP's argument.

Secondly, we should also point out that the Bolshevik party itself was a
secret organisation for most of its life in Tsarist Russia. Bakunin, an
exile from that society, would have been aware, like the Bolsheviks, of
the necessity of secret organising. Moreover, having spent a number of
years imprisoned by the Tsar, Bakunin would not have desired to end up
**back** in prison after escaping from Siberia to the West. In addition,
given that the countries in which anarchists were operating at the time
were not democracies, in the main, a secret organisation would have been
considered essential. As Murray Bookchin argues, *"Bakunin's emphasis on
conspiracy and secrecy can be understood only against the social
background of Italy, Spain, and Russia the three countries in Europe
where conspiracy and secrecy were matters of sheer survival."* [**The
Spanish Anarchists**, p. 24] The SWP ignore the historical context.

Thirdly, the reality of Bakunin's organisation is slightly different
from the SWP's claims. We have discussed this issue in great detail in
[section J.3.7](secJ3.html#secj37) of the FAQ. However, it is useful to
indicate the type of organisation Bakunin thought was necessary to aid
the revolution. If we do, it soon becomes clear that the SWP's claim
that it was *"not under the democratic control of its members"* is not
true. To do so we shall quote from his letter to the Russian Nihilist
Sergy Nechayev in which he explains the differences in their ideas. He
discusses the *"principles and mutual conditions"* for a *"new society"*
of revolutionaries in Russia (noting that this was an *"outline of a
plan"* which *"must be developed, supplemented, and sometimes altered
according to circumstances"*):

> *"Equality among all members and the unconditional and absolute
> solidarity -- one for all and all for one -- with the obligation for
> each and everyone to help each other, support and save each other. .
> .*
>
> "Complete frankness among members and proscription of any Jesuitical

As can be seen, while there is much in Bakunin's ideas that few
anarchists would agree to, it cannot be said that it was **not** under
the *"democratic control of its members."* The system of committees is
hardly libertarian but neither is it the top-down dictatorship the SWP
argue it was. For example, the central committee was chosen by the
*"general meeting"* of the members, which also decided upon the
*"programme of the society and the progress of the cause."* Its
*"decision"* was *"absolute law"* and the central committee could be
replaced by it. Moreover, the membership could ignore the decisions of
the central committee if it *"contradict[ed] either the general
programme of the principle rules, or the general revolutionary plan of
action, which are known to everybody as all . . . have participated
equally in the discussion of them."* Each tier of the organisation had
the same *"programme and regulations."* Anarchists today would agree
that Bakunin's plan was extremely flawed. The appointment of committees
from above is hardly libertarian, even given that each tier had the same
*"regulations"* and so general meetings of each Fraternity, for example.
However, the SWP's summary of Bakunin's ideas, as can be seen, is
flawed.

Given that no other anarchist group or federation operated in this way,
it is hard to generalise from Bakunin's flawed ideas on organisation to
a conclusion about anarchism. But, of course, this is what the SWP do --
and such a generalisation is simply a lie. The example of the F.A.I.,
the SWP's other example, indicates how most anarchist organisations work
in practice -- namely, a decentralised federation of autonomous groups
(see [section 22](append34.html#app22)).

Moreover, as we will indicate in the [next
section](append34.html#app21), the SWP have little reason to attack
Bakunin's ideas. This is because Lenin had similar (although not
identical) ones on the question of organising revolutionaries in Tsarist
Russia and because the SWP are renown for their leadership being
secretive, centralised, bureaucratic and top-down.

In summary, anarchists agree with the SWP that Bakunin's ideas are not
to be recommended while pointing out that the likes of the SWP fail to
provide an accurate account of their internal workings (i.e. they were
more democratic than the SWP suggest), the role Bakunin saw for them in
the labour movement and revolution or the historical context in which
they were shaped. Moreover, we also argue that their comments against
Bakunin, ironically, apply with equal force to their own party which is
renown, like all Bolshevik-style parties, as being undemocratic,
top-down and authoritarian. We turn to this issue in the [next
section.](append34.html#app21)

21. Why is the SWP's attack on Bakunin's organisation ironic?
-------------------------------------------------------------

That the SWP attack Bakunin's organisational schema (see [last
section](append34.html#app20)) is somewhat ironic. After all, the
Bolshevik party system had many of the features of Bakunin's
organisational plan. If Bakunin, quite rightly, should be attacked for
certain aspects of these ideas, then so must Bolshevik parties like the
SWP.

For example, Lenin argued in favour of centralisation and secrecy in his
work **What is to be Done?**. In this work he argued as follows:

> *"The active and widespread participation of the masses will not
> suffer; on the contrary, it will benefit by the fact that a 'dozen'
> experienced revolutionaries, no less professionally trained than the
> police, will centralise all the secret side of the work -- prepare
> leaflets, work out approximate plans and **appoint bodies of leaders**
> for each urban district, for each factory district and for each
> educational institution, etc. [our emphasis] (I know that exception
> will be taken to my 'undemocratic' views, but I shall reply to this
> altogether unintelligent objection later on.) The centralisation of
> the most secret functions in an organisation of revolutionaries will
> not diminish, but rather increase the extent and the quality of the
> activity of a large number of other organisations that are intended
> for wide membership and which, therefore, can be as loose and as
> public as possible, such as trade unions; workers' circles for
> self-education and the reading illegal literature, and socialist and
> also democratic, circles for **all other sections of the population**,
> etc., etc. We must have **as large a number as possible** of such
> organisations having the widest possible variety of functions, but it
> would be absurd and dangerous **to confuse them with the organisation
> of revolutionaries**, to erase the line of demarcation between them,
> to make still more the masses' already incredibly hazy appreciation of
> the fact that in order to 'serve' the mass movement we must have
> people who will devote themselves exclusively to Social-Democratic
> activities, and that such people must **train** themselves patiently
> and steadfastly to be professional revolutionaries."* [**The Essential
> Lenin**, p. 149]

And:

> *"The only serious organisational principle the active workers of our
> movement can accept is **strict secrecy, strict selection of
> members**, and the training of professional revolutionaries. If we
> possessed these qualities, something even more than 'democratism'
> would be guaranteed to us, namely, complete, comradely, mutual
> confidence among revolutionaries. And this is absolutely essential for
> us, because in Russia it is useless thinking that democratic control
> can substitute for it."* [our emphasis, **Op. Cit.**, p. 162]

Thus we have Lenin advocating *"strict secrecy, strict selection of
members"* as well as a centralised party which will *"appoint bodies of
leaders for each urban district, for each factory district and for each
educational institution."* The parallels with Bakunin's system are clear
and are predominately the result of the identical political conditions
both revolutionaries experienced. While anarchists are happy to indicate
and oppose the non-libertarian aspects of Bakunin's ideas, it is hard
for the likes of the SWP to attack Bakunin while embracing Lenin's ideas
on the party, justifying their more "un-democratic" aspects as a result
of the objective conditions of Tsarism.

Similar top-down perspectives can be seen from Bolshevism in Power. The
1918 constitution of the Soviet Union argued that local soviets were to
*"carry out all orders of the respective higher organs of the soviet
power."* In 1919, the Bolshevik's Eighth Party Congress strengthened
party discipline. As Maurice Brinton notes, the *"Congress ruled that
each decision must above all be fulfilled. Only after this is an appeal
to the corresponding Party organ permissible."* [**The Bolsheviks and
Workers' Control**, p. 55] He quotes the resolution:

> *"The whole matter of posting of Party workers is in the hands of the
> Central Committee. Its decisions are binding for everyone."* [**Op.
> Cit.**, pp. 55-6]

This perspective was echoed in the forerunner of the SWP, the
**International Socialists**. In September 1968, the Political Committee
of International Socialism submitted the *"Perspectives for I.S."* Point
4 said:

> *"Branches must accept directives from the Centre, unless they
> fundamentally disagree with them, in which case they should try to
> accord with them, while demanding an open debate on the matter."*
> [quoted by Brinton, **Op. Cit.**, p. 55f]

The parallels with Bakunin's ideas are clear (see [last
section](append34.html#app20)). However, it is to Bakunin's credit that
he argued that while *"each regional group have to obey it [the central
committee] unconditionally"* he recognised that there existed *"cases
where the orders of the Committee contradict either the general
programme of the principle rules, or the general revolutionary plan of
action, which are known to everybody as all . . . have participated
equally in the discussion of them."* when this happened, *"members of
the group must halt the execution of the Committee's orders and call the
Committee to judgement before the general meeting . . . If the general
meeting is discontented with the Committee, it can always substitute
another one for it."* Thus, rather than the unquestioning obedience of
the Bolshevik party, who have to obey, then complain, the members of
Bakunin's group did not negate their judgement and could refuse to carry
out orders.

Therefore, the SWP have a problem. On the one hand, they denounce
Bakunin's ideas of a centralised, secret top-down organisation of
revolutionaries. On the other, the party structure that Lenin recommends
is also a tightly disciplined, centralised, top-down structure with a
membership limited to those who are willing to be professional
revolutionaries. They obviously want to have their cake and eat it too.
Unfortunately for them, they cannot. If they attack Bakunin, they must
attack Lenin, not to do so is hypocrisy.

The simple fact is that the parallels between Bakunin's and Lenin's
organisational ideas cannot be understood without recognising that both
revolutionaries were operating in an autocratic state under conditions
of complete illegality, with a highly organised political police trying
to infiltrate and destroy any attempt to change the regime. Once this is
recognised, the SWP's comments can be seen to be hypocritical in the
extreme. Nor can their feeble attempt to use Bakunin to generalise about
all anarchist organisations be taken seriously as Bakunin's
organisations were not *"major"* nor were his ideas on secret
organisation and organising followed after his death. They were a
product of Bakunin's experiences in Tsarist Russian and not generic to
anarchism (as the SWP know fine well).

Moreover, many people leave the SWP due to its undemocratic,
authoritarian and bureaucratic nature. The comments by one group of
ex-SWP dissidents indicate the hypocrisy of the SWP's attack on Bakunin:

> *"The SWP is not democratic centralist but bureaucratic centralist.
> The leadership's control of the party is unchecked by the members. New
> perspectives are initiated exclusively by the central committee (CC),
> who then implement their perspective against all party opposition,
> implicit or explicit, legitimate or otherwise.*
>

> **Discussion Document of Ex-SWP Comrades**]

They argue that a *"democratic"* party would involve the *"[r]egular
election of all party full-timers, branch and district leadership,
conference delegates, etc. with the right of recall,"* which means that
in the SWP appointment of full-timers, leaders and so on is the norm.
They argue for the *"right of branches to propose motions to the party
conference"* and for the *"right for members to communicate horizontally
in the party, to produce and distribute their own documents."* They
stress the need for *"an independent Control Commission to review all
disciplinary cases (independent of the leadership bodies that exercise
discipline), and the right of any disciplined comrades to appeal
directly to party conference."* They argue that in a democratic party
*"no section of the party would have a monopoly of information"* which
indicates that the SWP's leadership is essentially secretive,
withholding information from the party membership. [**Op. Cit.**] As can
be seen, the SWP have little grounds on which to attack Bakunin given
this damning account of its internal workings.

Other dissidents argue the same point. In 1991 members in Southampton
SWP asked *"When was the last time a motion or slate to conference was
opposed?"* and pointed out:

> *"The CC usually stays the same or changes by one member. Most of the
> changes to its composition are made between Conferences. None of the
> CC's numerous decisions made over the preceding year are challenged or
> brought to account. Even the Pre-Conference bulletins contain little
> disagreements."*

They stress that:

> *"There is real debate within the SWP, but the framework for
> discussion is set by the Central Committee. The agenda's national
> events . . . are set by the CC or its appointees and are never
> challenged . . . Members can only express their views through
> Conference and Council to the whole party indirectly."* [quoted by
> Trotwatch, **Carry On Recruiting!**, p. 39 and pp. 40-1]

Therefore, the SWP does not really have a leg to stand on. While
Bakunin's ideas on organisation are far from perfect, the actual
practice of the SWP places their comments in context. They attack
Bakunin while acting in similar ways while claiming they do not.
Anarchists do not hold up Bakunin's ideas on how anarchists should
organise themselves as examples to be followed nor as particularly
democratic (in contrast to his ideas on how the labour movement and
revolution should be organised, which we **do** recommend) -- as the SWP
know. However, the SWP claim they are a revolutionary party and yet
their organisational practices are deeply anti-democratic with a veneer
of (bourgeois) democracy. The hypocrisy is clear.

Ironically, the ISG dissidents who attack the SWP for being
*"bureaucratic centralist"* note that *"[a]nybody who has spent time
involved in 'Leninist' organisations will have come across workers who
agree with Marxist politics but refuse to join the party because they
believe it to be undemocratic and authoritarian. Many draw the
conclusion that Leninism itself is at fault, as every organisation that
proclaims itself Leninist appears to follow the same pattern."* [**Lenin
vs. the SWP: Bureaucratic Centralism Or Democratic Centralism?**] This
is a common refrain with Leninists -- when reality says one thing and
the theory another, it must be reality that is at fault. Yes, every
Leninist organisation may be bureaucratic and authoritarian but it is
not the theory's fault that those who apply it are not capable of
actually doing it. Such an application of scientific principles by the
followers of *"scientific socialism"* is worthy of note -- obviously the
usual scientific method of generalising from facts to produce a theory
is inapplicable when evaluating "scientific socialism" itself.

One last point. While some may argue that the obvious parallels between
Bakunin's ideas and Lenin's should embarrass anarchists, most anarchists
disagree. This is for four reasons.

Firstly, anarchists are **not** *"Bakuninists"* or followers of
*"Bakuninism."* This means that we do not blindly follow the ideas of
individuals, rather we take what we find useful and reject the flawed
and non-libertarian aspects of their ideas. Therefore, if we think
Bakunin's specific ideas on how revolutionaries should organise are
flawed and not libertarian then we reject them while keeping the bulk of
Bakunin's useful and libertarian ideas as inspiration. We do not
slavishly follow individuals or their ideas but apply critical judgement
and embrace what we find useful and reject what we consider nonsense.

Secondly, anarchism did not spring fully formed out of Bakunin's (or
Proudhon's or Kropotkin's or whoever's) mind. We expect individuals to
make mistakes, not to be totally consistent, not totally break with
their background. Bakunin clearly did not manage to break completely
with his background as a political exile and an escapee from Tsarist
Russia. Hence his arguments and support for secret organisation -- his
experiences, like Lenin's, pushed him in that direction. Moreover, we
should also remember that Russia was not the only country which the
anarchist and labour movements were repressed during this time. In
France, after the defeat of the Paris Commune, the International was
made illegal. The Spanish section of the International had been
proscribed in 1872 and the central and regional authorities repressed it
systematically from the summer of 1873, forcing the organisation to
remain underground between 1874 and 1881. As can be seen, the SWP forget
the historical context when attacking Bakunin's secrecy.

Thirdly, Bakunin did not, like Lenin, think that *"socialist
consciousness"* had to be introduced into the working class. He argued
that due to the *"economic struggle of labour and capital"* a worker who
joined the International Workers' Association *"would inevitably
discover, through the very force of circumstances and through the
develop of this struggle, the political, socialist, and philosophical
principles of the International."* He thought that working class people
were *"**socialists without knowing it**"* as *"their most basic
instinct and their social situation makes them . . . earnestly and truly
socialist . . . They are socialist because of all the conditions of
their material existence and all the needs of their being. . . The
workers lack neither the potential for socialist aspirations nor their
actuality; they lack socialist thought."* Thus the *"germs"* of
*"socialist thought"* are to *"be found in the instinct of every earnest
worker. The goal . . . is to make the worker fully aware of what he
wants."* The method? The class struggle itself -- *"the International
relies on the collective experience he gains in its bosom, especially on
the progress of the collective struggle of the workers against the
bosses."* [**The Basic Bakunin**, p. 100 and pp. 101-3]

Bakunin did not deny the importance of those who already are socialists
to organise themselves and *"influence"* those who were not socialists
so that in *"critical moments [they will] . . . follow the
International's lead."* However, this influence was **not** to inject
socialist ideas into the working class but rather to aid their
development by the *"propagation of its [the International] ideas and .
. . the organisation of its members' natural effect on the masses."* As
can be seen, Bakunin's ideas on this subject differ considerably from
Lenin's. [**Op. Cit.**, p. 139 and p. 140]

Unsurprisingly, the programme of the revolutionary organisation had to
reflect the instincts and needs of the working population and must never
be imposed on them. As he argued, the working masses were *"not a blank
page on which any secret society can write whatever it wishes . . . It
has worked out, partly consciously, probably three-quarters
unconsciously, its own programme which the secret society must get to
know or guess and to which it must adapt itself."* He stresses that once
the state *"is destroyed . . . the people will rise . . . for **their
own** [ideal]"* and anyone *"who tries to foist **his own** programme on
the people will be left holding the baby."* [quoted in **Daughter of a
Revolutionary**, Michael Confino (ed.), p. 252, p. 254 and p. 256] As he
stresses, libertarian socialist ideas come from the masses and not from
outside them:

> *"In opposition to . . . oppressive statist orientations . . . an
> entirely new orientation finally arose from the depths of the
> proletariat itself . . . It proceeds directly to the abolition of all
> exploitation and all political or juridical as well as governmental
> and bureaucratic oppression, in other words, to the abolition of all
> classes . . . and the abolition of their last buttress, the state.*
>
> "That is the program of social revolution." [**Statism and Anarchy**,
> pp. 48-9]

Therefore, for Bakunin, the revolutionary organisation did not play the
same role as for Lenin. It existed to aid the development of socialist
consciousness within the working class, not inject that consciousness
into a mass who cannot develop it by their own efforts. The difference
is important as Lenin's theory justified the substitution of party power
for workers power, the elimination of democracy and the domination of
the party over the class it claimed to represent. Bakunin, recognising
that socialist ideas are *"instinctive"* in the working class due to
their position in society and their everyday experiences, could not do
this as the organisation existed to clarify these tendencies, not create
them in the first place and inject them into the masses.

Lastly, the role the organisation plays in the workers' movement and
revolution are distinctly different. As Bakunin constantly stressed, the
secret organisation must never take state power. As he put it, the
*"main purpose and task of the organisation"* would be to *"help the
people to achieve self-determination."* It would *"not threaten the
liberty of the people because it is free from all official character"*
and *"not placed above the people like state power."* Its programme
*"consists of the fullest realisation of the liberty of the people"* and
its influence is *"not contrary to the free development and
self-determination of the people, or its organisation from below
according to its own customs and instincts because it acts on the people
only by the natural personal influence of its members who are not
invested with any power."* Thus the revolutionary group would be the
*"helper"* of the masses, with an *"organisation within the people
itself."* [quoted by Michael Confino, **Op. Cit.**, p. 259, p. 261, p.
256 and p. 261] The revolution itself would see *"an end to all masters
and to domination of every kind, and the free construction of popular
life in accordance with popular needs, not from above downward, as in
the state, but from below upward, by the people themselves, dispensing
with all governments and parliaments -- a voluntary alliance of
agricultural and factory worker associations, communes, provinces, and
nations; and, finally, . . . universal human brotherhood triumphing on
the ruins of all the states."* [**Statism and Anarchy**, p. 33]

As can be seen, instead of seeking state power, as Lenin's party
desired, Bakunin's would seek *"natural influence"* rather than
*"official influence."* As we argued in [section
J.3.7](secJ3.html#secj37), this meant influencing the class struggle and
revolution within the mass assemblies of workers' associations and
communes and in their federations. Rather than seek state power and
official leadership positions, as the Leninist party does, Bakunin's
organisation rejected the taking of hierarchical positions in favour of
working at the base of the organisation and providing a *"leadership of
ideas"* rather than of people (see [section J.3.6](secJ3.html#secj36)).
While Bakunin's organisational structures are flawed from a libertarian
perspective (although more democratic than Marxists claim) the way it
works within popular organisations **is** libertarian and in stark
contrast with the Leninist position which sees these bodies as stepping
stones for party power.

Therefore, Bakunin rejected key Leninist ideas and so cannot be
considered as a forefather of Bolshevism in spite of similar
organisational suggestions. The similarity in structure is due to a
similarity in political conditions in Russia and **not** similarities in
political ideas. If we look at Bakunin's ideas on social revolution and
the workers' movement we see a fully libertarian perspective -- of a
movement from the bottom-up, based on the principles of direct action,
self-management and federalism. Anarchists since his death have applied
**these** ideas to the specific anarchist organisation as well,
rejecting the non-libertarian elements of Bakunin's ideas which the SWP
correctly (if somewhat hypocritically and dishonestly) denounce.

22. Was the F.A.I. a *"centralised and secret"* organisation that shunned *"open debate and common struggle"*?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

They move onto Spanish Anarchism:

> *"The anarchist organisation inside the Spanish C.N.T., the F.A.I.,
> was centralised and secret. A revolutionary party thrives on open
> debate and common struggle with wider groups of workers."*

We discuss this Marxist myth in more detail in [section
3](append32.html#app3) of the appendix on [*"Marxists and Spanish
Anarchism"*](append32.html). However a few points are worth making. The
F.A.I., regardless of what the SWP assert, was not centralised. It was a
federation of autonomous affinity groups. As one member put it:

> *"It was never its aim to act as a leadership or anything of the sort
> -- to begin with they had no slogans, nor was any line laid down, let
> alone any adherence to any hierarchical structure . . . This is what
> outside historians ought to grasp once and for all: that neither
> Durruti, nor Ascaso, nor Garcia Oliver -- to name only the great
> C.N.T. spokesmen -- issued any watchwords to the 'masses,' let alone
> delivered any operational plan or conspiratorial scheme to the bulk of
> the C.N.T. membership."*

He stresses that:

> *"Each F.A.I. group thought and acted as it deemed fit, without
> bothering about what the others might be thinking or deciding . . .
> they had no . . . opportunity or jurisdiction . . . to foist a party
> line upon the grass-roots."* [Francisco Carrasquer, quoted by Stuart
> Christie, **We, the Anarchists!**, p. 25 and p. 28]

Murray Bookchin paints a similar picture:

> *"The F.A.I. . . . was more loosely jointed as an organisation than
> many of its admirers and critics seem to recognise. It has no
> bureaucratic apparatus, no membership cards or dues, and no
> headquarters with paid officials, secretaries, and clerks. . . They
> jealously guarded the autonomy of their affinity groups from the
> authority of higher organisational bodies-a state of mind hardly
> conducive to the development of a tightly knit, vanguard
> organisation.*
> "The F.A.I., moreover, was not a politically homogeneous organisation
> which followed a fixed 'line' like the Communists and many Socialists.
> It had no official program by which all faistas could mechanically
> guide their actions." [**The Spanish Anarchists**, p. 224]

Stuart Christie argues that the decentralised nature of the F.A.I.
helped it survive the frequent repression directed against it and the
C.N.T:

> *"The basic units of the F.A.I. were . . . small autonomous affinity
> groups of anarchist militants. This cohesive quasi-cellular form of
> association had evolved, gradually, over the period of time it takes
> for relationships to be established and for mutual trust to grow. The
> affinity groups consisted, usually, of between three and 10 members
> bound by ties of friendship, and who shared well defined aims and
> agreed methods of struggle. Once such a group had come into existence
> it could, if it so wished, solicit affiliation to the F.A.I. . . The
> affinity groups were also highly resistant to police infiltration.
> Even if filtration did occur, or police agents did manage to set up
> their own 'affinity' groups it would not have been a particularly
> efficient means of intelligence gathering; the atomic structure of the
> F.A.I. meant there was no central body to provide an overview of the
> movement as a whole."* [**We, the Anarchists!**, p. 28]

He stresses its decentralised nature:

> *"Above all, it was not a representative body and involved **no**
> delegation of power either within the affinity groups or in the
> regional or national administrative bodies to empower those bodies to
> make decisions on behalf of the collectivity. Drawing on many years of
> revolutionary experience the F.A.I. was firmly rooted in federal

> function did not deprive its constituent members of their autonomous
> power. . . . In situations where it was necessary for delegates to

> executive power of any description. Their function was purely
> administrative."* [**Op. Cit.**, pp. 29-30]

Therefore, the claim that the F.A.I. was a centralised organisation is
simply false. Rather it was a federation of autonomous groups, as can be
seen (see also [section 3](append32.html#app3) of the appendix on
[*"Marxists and Spanish Anarchism"*](append32.html) for more discussion
on this topic).

Was the F.A.I. a *"secret"* organisation? When it was founded in 1927,
Spain was under the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera and so it was
illegal and secret by necessity. As Stuart Christie correctly notes,
*"[a]s an organisation publicly committed to the overthrow of the
dictatorship, the F.A.I. functioned, from 1927 to 1931, as an illegal
rather than a secret organisation. From the birth of the Republic in
1931 onwards, the F.A.I. was simply an organisation which, until 1937,
refused to register as an organisation as required by Republican Law."*
[**We, the Anarchists!**, p. 24] Thus it was illegal rather than secret.
As one anarchist militant asked, *"[i]f it was secret, how come I was
able to attend F.A.I. meetings without ever having joined or paid dues
to the 'specific' organisation?"* [Francesco Carrasquer, quoted by
Christie, **Op. Cit.**, p. 24]

Moreover, given the periods of repression suffered by the Spanish
libertarian movement throughout its history (including being banned and
forced underground) being an illegal organisation made perfect sense.
The anarchist movement was made illegal a number of times. Nor did the
repression end during the Republic of 1931-6. This means that for the
F.A.I. to be illegal was a sensible thing to do, particularly after
failed revolutionary attempts resulted in massive arrests and the
closing of union halls. Again, the SWP ignore historical context and so
mislead the reader.

Did the F.A.I. ignore *"open debate and common struggle."* No, of course
not. The members of the F.A.I. were also members of the C.N.T. The
C.N.T. was based around mass assemblies in which all members could
speak. It was here that members of the F.A.I. took part in forming
C.N.T. policy along with other C.N.T. members. Anarchists in the C.N.T.
who were not members of the F.A.I. indicate this. Jose Borras Casacarosa
notes that *"[o]ne has to recognise that the F.A.I. did not intervene in
the C.N.T. from above or in an authoritarian manner as did other
political parties in the unions. It did so from the base through
militants . . . the decisions which determined the course taken by the
C.N.T. were taken under constant pressure from these militants."* Jose
Campos notes that F.A.I. militants *"tended to reject control of
confederal committees and only accepted them on specific occassions . .
. if someone proposed a motion in assembly, the other F.A.I. members
would support it, usually successfully. It was the individual standing
of the faista in open assembly."* [quoted by Stuart Christie, **Op.
Cit.**, p. 62] As Francisco Ascaso (friend of Durruti and an influential
anarchist militant in the C.N.T. and F.A.I. in his own right) put it:

> *"There is not a single militant who as a 'F.A.I.ista' intervenes in
> union meetings. I work, therefore I am an exploited person. I pay my
> dues to the workers' union and when I intervene at union meetings I do
> it as someone who us exploited, and with the right which is granted me
> by the card in my possession, as do the other militants, whether they
> belong to the F.A.I. or not."* [cited by Abel Paz, **Durruti: The
> People Armed**, p. 137]

This meant that it was at union meetings and congresses where policies
and the program for the movement were argued out:

> *"[D]elegates, whether or not they were members of the F.A.I., were
> presenting resolutions adopted by their unions at open membership
> meetings. Actions taken at the congress had to be reported back to
> their unions at open meetings, and given the degree of union education
> among the members, it was impossible for delegates to support
> personal, non-representative positions."* [Juan Gomez Casas,
> **Anarchist Organisation: The History of the F.A.I.**, p. 121]

As can be seen, open debate with their fellow workers in the union
assemblies. In this they followed Bakunin's arguments that anarchist
organisation *"rules out any idea of dictatorship and of a controlling
and directive power"* and it *"will promote the Revolution only through
the **natural but never official influence** of all members of the
Alliance."* This influence would be exerted in the union assemblies, as
the union members *"could only defend their rights and their autonomy in
only one way: the workers called general membership meetings. Nothing
arouses the antipathy of the committees more than these popular
assemblies. . . In these great meetings of the sections, the items on
the agenda was amply discussed and the most progressive opinion
prevailed. . ."* This would ensure that the assemblies had *"real
autonomy"* and actually were the real power in the organisation. Any
committees would be made up of *"delegates who conscientiously fulfilled
all their obligations to their respective sections as stipulated in the
statues,"* *"reporting regularly to the membership the proposals made
and how they voted"* and *"asking for further instructions (plus instant
recall of unsatisfactory delegates)"* [**Bakunin on Anarchism**, p. 154,
p. 387 and p. 247]

The anarchist revolution would be organised in an identical fashion,
and, in Bakunin's words, *"must be created by the people, and supreme
control must always belong to the people organised into a free
federation of agricultural and industrial associations . . . organised
from the bottom upwards by means of revolutionary delegations . . .
[who] will set out to administer public services, not to rule over
peoples."* [**Michael Bakunin: Selected Writings**, p. 172]

As can be seen, the F.A.I. (like all anarchists) influenced the class
struggle and revolution via their natural influence in winning debates
with their fellow workers in union assemblies. They did not seek power
but rather influence for their ideas. To claim otherwise, to claim that
anarchists reject open debate with their fellow workers is false.
Instead of seeking to power -- and so limiting debates to during
elections -- anarchists argue that people must control their own
organisations (and so the revolution) directly and all the time. This
means, as can be seen, we encourage open debate and discussion far more
than those, like the SWP, who seek centralised political power for
themselves. In such a system, the only people who debate regularly are
the members of the government -- everyone else is just a voter and an
order taker.

23. Do anarchists wait for *"spontaneous upsurges by workers"*?
---------------------------------------------------------------

After lying about the F.A.I., they move on to lying about anarchist
theory:

> *"Anarchists instead look to spontaneous upsurges by workers. In the
> struggle anarchists will declare themselves and urge the workers on.
> They hope this will lead to the toppling of capitalism. History is
> full of mass struggles which have been able to win significant gains,
> but which have not had a clear leadership that can carry the struggle
> over to victory against capitalism."*

Nothing could be further from the truth. Their own article exposes their
lies. They mention the C.N.T., which was organised in an anarchist way
and in which anarchists were heavily involved. Anarchists from Bakunin
onward have all argued in favour of organising as anarchists as well as
organising workers and fighting for reforms in the here and now. For
Bakunin, *"the natural organisation of the masses . . . is organisation
based on the various ways that their various types of work define their
day-to-day life; it is organisation by trade association."* [**The Basic
Bakunin**, p. 139] He stressed the importance of anarchists being
involved in unions as well as union struggle for reforms by direct
action:

> *"What policy should the International [Workers' Association] follow
> during th[e] somewhat extended time period that separates us from this
> terrible social revolution . . . the International will give labour
> unrest in all countries an essentially economic character, with the
> aim of reducing working hours and increasing salary, by means of the
> association of the working masses . . . It will [also] propagandise
> its principles . . ."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 109]

Indeed, he saw the labour movement as the means to create a socialist
society:

> *"The masses are a force, or at least the essential elements of a
> force. What do they lack? They lack two things which up till now
> constituted the power of all government: organisation and knowledge.*
>
> "The organisation of the International [Workers' Association], having
> for its objective not the creation of new despotisms but the uprooting
> of all domination, will take on an essentially different character
> from the organisation of the State. . . But what is the organisation
> of the masses? . . . It is the organisation by professions and trades
> . . .
>
> "The organisation of the trade sections and their representation in
> the Chambers of Labour . . . bear in themselves the living seeds of
> the new society which is to replace the old world. They are creating
> not only the ideas, but also the facts of the future itself."
> [**Bakunin on Anarchism**, pp. 254-5]

All anarchists have stressed the importance of working in and outside
the labour movement to gain influence for anarchist ideas of direct
action, solidarity, self-management and federalism in the here and now,
rather than waiting for a *"spontaneous uprising"* to occur. As
Kropotkin argued, *"Revolutionary Anarchist Communist propaganda with
Labour Unions had always been a favourite mode of action in the
Federalist [or libertarian] . . . section of the International Working
Men's Association."* [**Act For Yourselves**, p. 119] Malatesta makes
the same point:

> *"anarchists, convinced of the validity of our programme, must strive
> to acquire overwhelming influence in order to draw the movement
> towards the realisation of our ideas. But such influence must be won
> by doing more and better than others, and will only be useful if won
> in that way.*
>
> "Today we must deepen, develop and propagate our ideas and co-ordinate
> our forces in a common action. We must act within the labour movement
> to prevent it being limited to and corrupted by the exclusive pursuit
> of small improvements compatible with the capitalist system; and we
> must act in such a way that it contributes to preparing for a complete
> social transformation. We must work with the unorganised, and perhaps
> unorganisable, masses to awaken a spirit of revolt and the desire and
> hope for a free and happy life. We must initiate and support all
> movements that tend to weaken the forces of the State and of
> capitalism and to raise the mental level and material conditions of
> the workers. We must, in short, prepare, and prepare ourselves,
> morally and materially, for the revolutionary act which will open the
> way to the future." [**The Anarchist Revolution**, p. 109]

Therefore, as can be seen, the SWP's assertions are totally at odds with
the actual ideas of anarchists, as would be known by anyone with even a
basic understanding of anarchist theory. After all, if spontaneous
uprisings were sufficient in themselves we would be living in an
anarchist society. As Bakunin argued *"if instinct alone had been
sufficient for the liberation of peoples, they would have long since
freed themselves."* [**Bakunin on Anarchism**, p. 254] This explains why
anarchists organise **as anarchists** in groups and federations to
influence the class struggle. We are aware of the need for
revolutionaries to organise to influence the class struggle, spread
anarchist ideas and tactics and present the case for revolutionary
change. An anarchist society will not come about by accident, it must be
consciously desired and created by the mass of the population. As
Kropotkin argued:

> *"Communist organisations . . . must be the work of all, a natural
> growth, a product of the constructive genius of the great mass.
> Communism cannot be imposed from above; it could not live even for a
> few months if the constant and daily co-operation of all did not
> uphold it. It must be free."* [**Kropotkin's Revolutionary
> Pamphlets**, p. 140]

So, clearly, anarchists see the importance of working class organisation
and struggle in the here and now. Anarchists are active in industrial
disputes and (as the SWP note) the anti-globalisation movement and were
heavily involved in the anti-poll-tax and anti-Criminal Justice Act
struggles in the UK, for example. The role of anarchists is not to wait
for *"upsurges"* but rather to encourage them by spreading our ideas and
encouraging workers to organise and fight their bosses and the state. It
is for this reason anarchists form groups and federations, to influence
workers today rather than waiting for a *"spontaneous uprising"* to
occur. Moreover, it is quite ironic that the SWP say that anarchists
wait for upsurges before declaring themselves to the masses. After all,
that is what the SWP do. They turn up at picket lines and try and sell
their paper and party to the strikers. Obviously, if anarchist do this,
it is bad, if the SWP do it, then it is *"revolutionary."*

Therefore, rather than believing in or waiting for *"spontaneous
upsurges"* anarchists, like the SWP, spread their message, try and
convince people to become revolutionaries. That is why there are
numerous anarchist federations across the world, involved in numerous
struggles and working class organisations, with magazines, papers and
leaflets being produced and distributed. Anarchists stress the
importance of winning people over to anarchist ideas and of giving a
*"lead"* in struggle rather than as a *"leadership"* (which implies a
hierarchical relationship between the mass of people and a group of
leaders). To state otherwise, to argue we wait for spontaneous
uprisings, is simply a lie.

Anarchist organisations see themselves in the role of aiders, not
leaders. As Voline argued, the politically aware minority *"should
intervene. But, in every place and under all circumstances, . . . [they]
should freely participate in the common work, **as true collaborators,
not as dictators**. It is necessary that they especially create an
example, and employ themselves. . . without dominating, subjugating, or
oppressing anyone. . . Accordingly to the libertarian thesis, it is the
labouring masses themselves, who, by means of the various class
organisations, factory committees, industrial and agricultural unions,
co-operatives, et cetera, federated. . . should apply themselves
everywhere, to solving the problems of waging the Revolution. . . As for
the 'elite' [i.e. the politically aware], their role, according to the
libertarians, is to **help** the masses, enlighten them, teach them,
give them necessary advice, impel them to take initiative, provide them
with an example, and support them in their action -- **but not to direct
them governmentally**."* [**The Unknown Revolution**, pp. 177-8]

Sadly, Leninists like the SWP confuse giving a led with taking power
themselves. They seek to take over positions of responsibility in a
movement and turn them into positions of power which they can use to
tell the others what to do. Instead of being the servants of the
organisation, they become its masters. For this reason anarchist
organisations try to influence movements from below, in the mass
assemblies which make it up, rather than seek power.

24. Do anarchists blame workers *"for being insufficiently revolutionary"*?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

After creating a straw man about anarchist theory, they draw some
thoughts from it:

> *"When struggles have not spontaneously broken capitalism, anarchists
> have tended to end up blaming workers for being insufficiently
> revolutionary. So 19th century French anarchist Pierre-Joseph Proudhon
> started off talking of his 'love of the people' but ended up saying he
> 'despised' humanity because they had not overthrown capitalism."*

Strange that they picked Proudhon as he was not a revolutionary
anarchist. Rather he favoured the reform of capitalism via mutual credit
and workers' co-operatives and rejected the idea of "uprisings" and/or
revolution (spontaneous or not). Anyone with even a limited knowledge of
Proudhon's work would know this. In addition, Proudhon's last book
(**The Political Capacity of the Working Classes**), finished on his
death bed, was an attempt to influence the workers' movement towards his
ideas of mutualism and federalism. Hardly to be expected from someone
who "despised" humanity for not overthrowing capitalism. As examples go,
the SWP is clearly clutching at straws.

Moreover, as we argued in the [last section](append34.html#app23),
revolutionary anarchists like Bakunin, Malatesta, Kropotkin, Goldman,
Berkman, Rocker, etc., all placed a great deal of time and energy in
trying to work within and influence workers' struggles and the labour
movement in the here and now. They did not think that workers struggles
would necessarily "spontaneously" break capitalism. While recognising,
as we indicated in [section 10](append34.html#app10), that the class
struggle changed the ideas of those involved, they recognised the need
for anarchist groups, papers, pamphlets to influence the class struggle
in a libertarian way and towards a revolution. They were well aware that
"spontaneous" uprisings occurred but were not enough in themselves --
anarchists would need to organise as anarchists to influence the class
struggle, particularly when "uprisings" were not occurring and the daily
struggle between governed and governor, exploited and exploiter was
taking less spectacular forms (hence anarchist support and involvement
in the labour movement and unions like the C.N.T.).

The SWP then move onto an even greater factual error. They claim that
the *"biggest anarchist groups today, the 'autonomists' in Europe, treat
workers who have not fully broken with capitalist ideas as an enemy
rather than a potential ally."* Unfortunately for them, the
"autonomists" are not generally anarchists (the name should have given
the SWP some clue, as anarchists are quite proud of their name and
generally use it, or libertarian, to describe themselves). Rather the
"autonomists" are non-Leninist Marxists whose ideas (and name)
originally came from the Marxist left in Italy during the 1960s. It is
also probable that the various European anarchist federations (such as
the French and Italian) and anarcho-syndicalist unions are bigger than
the autonomists. However, without any examples of the groups meant it is
hard to evaluate the accuracy of the SWP's claims as regards their size
or opinions. Suffice it to say, the leading theorists of "autonomism"
such as Toni Negri and Harry Cleaver do not express the opinions the SWP
claim "autonomists" have.

25. Why does the history of centralised parties refute the SWP's arguments?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The SWP admit that their analysis leaves much to be desired by
mentioning that *"[m]any anarchists understand the way that capitalism
works and organise to change the world."* In other words, if an
anarchist points out the flaws in their argument or a reader knows an
anarchist who does not match the SWP's distorted picture, then the SWP
can say that they are part of the *"many."* Extremely handy, if
dishonest, comment to make.

The SWP continue by arguing that our *"rejection of centralisation means
that at critical moments their intervention in the struggle is fatally
flawed."* This is ironic. Given that their example of the benefits of
centralisation showed the flaws in that method of organising, their
conclusion seems without basis. Moreover, as argued above,
centralisation is the key means by which minorities govern majorities.
It is a tool used to impose minority rule and is not designed for other
uses. But, then again, the SWP do aim for minority rule -- the rule of
the *"revolutionary"* party over the masses. As they argue:

> *"The working class needs what anarchism rejects - a clear and
> determined revolutionary party which can lead the working class as a
> whole, and is not afraid to overthrow capitalism and set up a workers'
> state."*

Yes, indeed. The examples of the current anti-capitalist movement, the
poll tax revolt and the 1917 February Russian revolution indicate well
that a revolutionary party works. If such a party had led the working
class in each of these events, they would not have occurred. The workers
would have done nothing, as the Bolsheviks desired. People would have
paid their poll tax waiting for the trade union bureaucrats to act. The
anti-globalisation demonstrations would not have happened as the
"vanguard" party did not recognise their importance.

The Russian Revolution quickly resulted in the marginalisation of the
workers' councils by the centralised, *"clear and determined"*
Bolsheviks who turned them into rubber stamps of their government, it
suggests that the politics of the SWP leave much to be desired. Given
that the one "success" of Leninist politics -- the Russian Revolution of
October 1917 -- created state capitalism, with workers' soviets and
factory committees undermined in favour of party power (**before**, we
must stress, the start of the civil war -- what most Leninists blame the
rise of Stalinism on) we may suggest that **anarchist** ideas have been
proven correct again and again. After all, the validity of a theory
surely lies in its ability to **explain** and **predict** events.
Anarchists, for example, predicted both the degeneration of both Social
Democracy and the Russian revolution, the two main examples of Marxism
in action, and presented coherent reasons **why** this would happen.
Marxists have had to generate theories to explain these events **after**
they have occurred, theories which conveniently ignore the role of
Marxist politics in historical events.

This, we suggest, provides the explanation of why they have spent so
much time re-writing history and smearing anarchism. Not being able to
discuss our ideas honesty -- for that would expose the authoritarian
ideas of Bolshevism and its role in the degeneration of the Russian
Revolution -- the SWP invent a straw man they call anarchism and beat
him to death. Unfortunately for them, anarchists are still around and
can expose their lies for what they are.
