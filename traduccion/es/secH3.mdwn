H.3 What are the myths of state socialism?
==========================================

Ask most people what socialism means and they will point to the Soviet
Union, China, Cuba and a host of other authoritarian, centralised,
exploitative and oppressive party dictatorships. These regimes have in
common two things. Firstly, the claim that their rulers are Marxists or
socialists. Secondly, that they have successfully alienated millions of
working class people from the very idea of socialism. Indeed, the
supporters of capitalism simply had to describe the "socialist
paradises" as they really are in order to put people off socialism. The
Stalinist regimes and their various apologists (and even "opponents",
like the Trotskyists, who defended them as *"degenerated workers'
states"*) let the bourgeoisie have an easy time in dismissing all
working-class demands and struggles as so many attempts to set up
similar party dictatorships.

The association of *"socialism"* or *"communism"* with these
dictatorships has often made anarchists wary of calling themselves
socialists or communists in case our ideas are associated with them. As
Errico Malatesta argued in 1924:

> *"I foresee the possibility that the communist anarchists will
> gradually abandon the term 'communist': it is growing in ambivalence
> and falling into disrepute as a result of Russian 'communist'
> despotism. If the term is eventually abandoned this will be a
> repetition of what happened with the word 'socialist.' We who, in
> Italy at least, were the first champions of socialism and maintained
> and still maintain that we are the true socialists in the broad and
> human sense of the word, ended by abandoning the term to avoid
> confusion with the many and various authoritarian and bourgeois
> deviations of socialism. Thus too we may have to abandon the term
> 'communist' for fear that our ideal of free human solidarity will be
> confused with the avaricious despotism which has for some time
> triumphed in Russia and which one party, inspired by the Russian
> example, seeks to impose world-wide."* [**The Anarchist Revolution**,
> p. 20]

That, to a large degree happened with anarchists simply calling
themselves by that name (without adjectives) or libertarians to avoid
confusion. This, sadly, resulted in two problems. Firstly, it gave
Marxists even more potential to portray anarchism as being primarily
against the state and not being as equally opposed to capitalism,
hierarchy and inequality (as we argue in [section
H.2.4](secH2.html#sech24), anarchists have opposed the state as just one
aspect of class and hierarchical society). Secondly, extreme
right-wingers tried to appropriate the names *"libertarian"* and
*"anarchist"* to describe their vision of extreme capitalism as
*"anarchism,"* they claimed, was simply *"anti-government"* (see
[section F](secFcon.html) for discussion on why "anarcho"-capitalism is
not anarchist). To counter these distortions of anarchist ideas, many
anarchists have re-appropriated the use of the words *"socialist"* and
*"communist,"* although always in combination with the words
*"anarchist"* and *"libertarian."*

Such combination of words is essential as the problem Malatesta
predicted still remains. If one thing can be claimed for the 20th
century, it is that it has seen the word *"socialism"* become narrowed
and restricted into what anarchists call *"state socialism"* - socialism
created and run from above, by the state (i.e. by the state bureaucracy
and better described as state capitalism). This restriction of
"socialism" has been supported by both Stalinist and Capitalist ruling
elites, for their own reasons (the former to secure their own power and
gain support by associating themselves with socialist ideals, the latter
by discrediting those ideas by associating them with the horror of
Stalinism). The Stalinist *"leadership thus portrays itself as socialist
to protect its right to wield the club, and Western ideologists adopt
the same pretence in order to forestall the threat of a more free and
just society."* The latter use it as *"a powerful ideological weapon to
enforce conformity and obedience,"* to *"ensure that the necessity to
rent oneself to the owners and managers of these [capitalist]
institutions will be regarded as virtually a natural law, the only
alternative to the 'socialist' dungeon."* In reality, *"if there is a
relation"* between Bolshevism and socialism, *"it is the relation of
contradiction."* [*"The Soviet Union versus Socialism"*, pp. 47-52,
**The Radical Papers**, Dimitrios I. Roussopoulos (ed.), pp. 47-8]

This means that anarchists and other libertarian socialists have a major
task on their hands - to reclaim the promise of socialism from the
distortions inflicted upon it by both its enemies (Stalinists and
capitalists) and its erstwhile and self-proclaimed supporters (Social
Democracy and its offspring Bolshevism). A key aspect of this process is
a critique of both the practice and ideology of Marxism and its various
offshoots. Only by doing this can anarchists prove, to quote Rocker,
that *"**Socialism will be free, or it will not be at all**."*
[**Anarcho-Syndicalism**, p. 14]

Such a critique raises the problem of which forms of "Marxism" to
discuss. There is an extremely diverse range of Marxist viewpoints and
groups in existence. Indeed, the different groups spend a lot of time
indicating why all the others are not "real" Marxists (or
Marxist-Leninists, or Trotskyists, and so on) and are just "sects"
without "real" Marxist theory or ideas. This "diversity" is, of course,
a major problem (and somewhat ironic, given that some Marxists like to
insult anarchists by stating there are as many forms of anarchism as
anarchists!). Equally, many Marxists go further than dismissing specific
groups. Some even totally reject other branches of their movement as
being non-Marxist (for example, some Marxists dismiss Leninism as having
little, or nothing, to do with what they consider the *"real"* Marxist
tradition to be). This means that discussing Marxism can be difficult as
Marxists can argue that our FAQ does not address the arguments of this
or that Marxist thinker, group or tendency.

With this in mind, this section of the FAQ will concentrate on the works
of Marx and Engels (and so the movement they generated, namely Social
Democracy) as well as the Bolshevik tradition started by Lenin and
continued (by and large) by Trotsky. These are the core thinkers (and
the recognised authorities) of most Marxists and so latter derivations
of these tendencies can be ignored (for example Maoism, Castroism and so
on). It should also be noted that even this grouping will produce
dissent as some Marxists argue that the Bolshevik tradition is not part
of Marxism. This perspective can be seen in the *"impossiblist"*
tradition of Marxism (e.g. the **Socialist Party of Great Britain** and
its sister parties) as well as in the left/council communist tradition
(e.g. in the work of such Marxists as Anton Pannekoek and Paul Mattick).
The arguments for their positions are strong and well worth reading
(indeed, any honest analysis of Marxism and Leninism cannot help but
show important differences between the two). However, as the vast
majority of Marxists today are also Leninists, we have to reflect this
in our FAQ (and, in general, we do so by referring to "mainstream
Marxists" as opposed to the small minority of libertarian Marxists).

Another problem arises when we consider the differences not only between
Marxist tendencies, but also within a specific tendency before and after
its representatives seize power. For example, as Chomsky pointed out,
*"there are . . . very different strains of Leninism . . . there's the
Lenin of 1917, the Lenin of the 'April Theses' and **State and
Revolution**. That's one Lenin. And then there's the Lenin who took
power and acted in ways that are unrecognisable . . . compared with,
say, the doctrines of 'State and Revolution.' . . . this [is] not very
hard to explain. There's a big difference between the libertarian
doctrines of a person who is trying to associate himself with a mass
popular movement to acquire power and the authoritarian power of
somebody who's taken power and is trying to consolidate it. . . that is
true of Marx also. There are competing strains in Marx."* As such, this
section of our FAQ will try and draw out the contradictions within
Marxism and indicate what aspects of the doctrine aided the development
of the "second" Lenin for the seeds from which authoritarianism grew
post-October 1917 existed from the start. Anarchists agree with Chomsky,
namely that he considered it *"characteristic and unfortunate that the
lesson that was drawn from Marx and Lenin for the later period was the
authoritarian lesson. That is, it's the authoritarian power of the
vanguard party and destruction of all popular forums in the interests of
the masses. That's the Lenin who became know to later generations.
Again, not very surprisingly, because that's what Leninism really was in
practice."* [**Language and Politics**, p. 152]

Ironically, given Marx's own comments on the subject, a key hindrance to
such an evaluation is the whole idea and history of Marxism itself.
While, as Murray Bookchin noted *"to his lasting credit,"* Marx tried
(to some degree) *"to create a movement that looks to the future instead
of to the past,"* his followers have not done so. *"Once again,"*
Bookchin argued, *"the dead are walking in our midst - ironically,
draped in the name of Marx, the man who tried to bury the dead of the
nineteenth century. So the revolution of our own day can do nothing
better than parody, in turn, the October Revolution of 1918 and the
civil war of 1918-1920 . . . The complete, all-sided revolution of our
own day . . . follows the partial, the incomplete, the one-sided
revolutions of the past, which merely changed the form of the 'social
question,' replacing one system of domination and hierarchy by
another."* [**Post-Scarcity Anarchism**, p. 108 and p. 109] In Marx's
words, the *"tradition of all the dead generations weighs down like a
nightmare on the brain of the living."* Yet his own work, and the
movements it inspired, now add to this dead-weight. In order to ensure,
as Marx put it, the social revolution draws is poetry from the future
rather than the past, Marxism itself must be transcended.

Which, of course, means evaluating both the theory **and** practice of
Marxism. For anarchists, it seems strange that for a body of work whose
followers stress is revolutionary and liberating, its results have been
so bad. If Marxism is so obviously revolutionary and democratic, then
why have so few of the people who read it drawn those conclusions? How
could it be transmuted so easily into Stalinism? Why are there so few
**libertarian** Marxists, if it were Lenin (or, following Lenin, Social
Democracy) which "misinterpreted" Marx and Engels? So when Marxists
argue that the problem is in the interpretation of the message not in
the message itself, anarchists reply that the reason these numerous,
allegedly false, interpretations exist at all simply suggests that there
are limitations within Marxism **as such** rather than the readings it
has been subjected to. When something repeatedly fails and produces such
terrible results in the progress then there has to be a fundamental flaw
somewhere. Thus Cornelius Castoriadis:

> "Marx was, in fact, the first to stress that the significance of a
> theory cannot be grasped independently of the historical and social
> practice it inspires and initiates, to which it gives rise, in which
> it prolongs itself and under cover of which a given practice seeks to

> "Who, today, would dare proclaim that the only significance of

> the exegesis of texts." [*"The Fate of Marxism,"* pp. 75-84 **The
> Anarchist Papers**, Dimitrios Roussopoulos (ed.), p. 77]

This does not mean forsaking the work of Marx and Engels. It means
rejecting once and for all the idea that two people, writing over a
period of decades over a hundred years ago have all the answers. As
should be obvious! Ultimately, anarchists think we have to **build**
upon the legacy of the past, not squeeze current events into it. We
should stand on the shoulders of giants, not at their feet.

Thus this section of our FAQ will attempt to explain the various myths
of Marxism and provide an anarchist critique of it and its offshoots. Of
course, the ultimate myth of Marxism is what Alexander Berkman called
*"The Bolshevik Myth,"* namely the idea that the Russian Revolution was
a success. However, given the scope of this revolution, we will not
discuss it fully here except when it provides useful empirical evidence
for our critique (see [section H.6](secH6.html) for more on the Russian
Revolution). Our discussion here will concentrate for the most part on
Marxist theory, showing its inadequacies, its problems, where it
appropriated anarchist ideas and how anarchism and Marxism differ. This
is a big task and this section of the FAQ can only be a small
contribution to it.

As noted above, there are minority trends in Marxism which are
libertarian in nature (i.e. close to anarchism). As such, it would be
simplistic to say that anarchists are *"anti-Marxist"* and we generally
do differentiate between the (minority) libertarian element and the
authoritarian mainstream of Marxism (i.e. Social-Democracy and Leninism
in its many forms). Without doubt, Marx contributed immensely to the
enrichment of socialist ideas and analysis (as acknowledged by Bakunin,
for example). His influence, as to be expected, was both positive and
negative. For this reason he must be read and discussed critically. This
FAQ is a contribution to this task of transcending the work of Marx. As
with anarchist thinkers, we must take what is useful from Marx and
reject the rubbish. But never forget that anarchists are anarchists
precisely because we think that anarchist thinkers have got more right
than wrong and we reject the idea of tying our politics to the name of a
long dead thinker.

H.3.1 Do Anarchists and Marxists want the same thing?
-----------------------------------------------------

Ultimately, the greatest myth of Marxism is the idea that anarchists and
most Marxists want the same thing. Indeed, it could be argued that it is
anarchist criticism of Marxism which has made them stress the similarity
of long term goals with anarchism. *"Our polemics against [the
Marxists],"* Bakunin argued, *"have forced them to recognise that
freedom, or anarchy - that is, the voluntary organisation of the workers
from below upward - is the ultimate goal of social development."* He
stressed that the means to this apparently similar end were different.
The Marxists *"say that [a] state yoke, [a] dictatorship, is a necessary
transitional device for achieving the total liberation of the people:
anarchy, or freedom, is the goal, and the state, or dictatorship, is the
means . . . We reply that no dictatorship can have any other objective
than to perpetuate itself, and that it can engender and nurture only
slavery in the people who endure it. Liberty can be created only by
liberty, by an insurrection of all the people and the voluntary
organisation of the workers from below upwards."* [**Statism and
Anarchy**, p. 179]

As such, it is commonly taken for granted that the ends of both Marxists
and Anarchists are the same, we just disagree over the means. However,
within this general agreement over the ultimate end (a classless and
stateless society), the details of such a society are somewhat
different. This, perhaps, is to be expected given the differences in
means. As is obvious from Bakunin's argument, anarchists stress the
unity of means and goals, that the means which are used affect the goal
reached. This unity between means and ends is expressed well by Martin
Buber's observation that *"[o]ne cannot in the nature of things expect a
little tree that has been turned into a club to put forth leaves."*
[**Paths in Utopia**, p. 127] In summary, we cannot expect to reach our
end destination if we take a path going in the opposite direction. As
such, the agreement on ends may not be as close as often imagined.

So when it is stated that anarchists and state socialists want the same
thing, the following should be borne in mind. Firstly, there are key
differences on the question of current tactics. Secondly, there is the
question of the immediate aims of a revolution. Thirdly, there is the
long term goals of such a revolution. These three aspects form a
coherent whole, with each one logically following on from the last. As
we will show, the anarchist and Marxist vision of each aspect are
distinctly different, so suggesting that the short, medium **and** long
term goals of each theory are, in fact, different. We will discuss each
aspect in turn.

First, there is the question of the nature of the revolutionary
movement. Here anarchists and most Marxists have distinctly opposing
ideas. The former argue that both the revolutionary organisation (i.e.
an anarchist federation) and the wider labour movement should be
organised in line with the vision of society which inspires us. This
means that it should be a federation of self-managed groups based on the
direct participation of its membership in the decision making process.
Power, therefore, is decentralised and there is no division between
those who make the decisions and those who execute them. We reject the
idea of others acting on our behalf or on behalf of the people and so
urge the use of direct action and solidarity, based upon working class
self-organisation, self-management and autonomy. Thus, anarchists apply
their ideas in the struggle against the current system, arguing what is
"efficient" from a hierarchical or class position is deeply inefficient
from a revolutionary perspective.

Marxists disagree. Most Marxists are also Leninists. They argue that we
must form a *"vanguard"* party based on the principles of *"democratic
centralism"* complete with institutionalised and hierarchical
leadership. They argue that how we organise today is independent of the
kind of society we seek and that the party should aim to become the
recognised leadership of the working class. Every thing they do is
subordinated to this end, meaning that no struggle is seen as an end in
itself but rather as a means to gaining membership and influence for the
party until such time as it gathers enough support to seize power. As
this is a key point of contention between anarchists and Leninists, we
discuss this in some detail in [section H.5](secH5.html) and its related
sections and so not do so here.

Obviously, in the short term anarchists and Leninists cannot be said to
want the same thing. While we seek a revolutionary movement based on
libertarian (i.e. revolutionary) principles, the Leninists seek a party
based on distinctly bourgeois principles of centralisation, delegation
of power and representative over direct democracy. Both, of course,
argue that only their system of organisation is effective and efficient
(see [section H.5.8](secH5.html#sech58) on a discussion why anarchists
argue that the Leninist model is not effective from a revolutionary
perspective). The anarchist perspective is to see the revolutionary
organisation as part of the working class, encouraging and helping those
in struggle to clarify the ideas they draw from their own experiences
and its role is to provide a lead rather than a new set of leaders to be
followed (see [section J.3.6](secJ3.html#secj36) for more on this). The
Leninist perspective is to see the revolutionary party as the leadership
of the working class, introducing socialist consciousness into a class
which cannot generate itself (see [section H.5.1](secH5.html#sech51)).

Given the Leninist preference for centralisation and a leadership role
by hierarchical organisation, it will come as no surprise that their
ideas on the nature of post-revolutionary society are distinctly
different from anarchists. While there is a tendency for Leninists to
deny that anarchists have a clear idea of what will immediately be
created by a revolution (see [section H.1.4](secH1.html#sech14)), we do
have concrete ideas on the kind of society a revolution will immediately
create. This vision is in almost every way different from that proposed
by most Marxists.

Then there is the question of the state. Anarchists, unsurprisingly
enough, seek to destroy it. Simply put, while anarchists want a
stateless and classless society and advocate the means appropriate to
those ends, most Marxists argue that in order to reach a stateless
society we need a new "workers'" state, a state, moreover, in which
their party will be in charge. Trotsky, writing in 1906, made this
clear: *"Every political party deserving of the name aims at seizing
governmental power and thus putting the state at the service of the
class whose interests it represents."* [quoted by Israel Getzler,
**Marxist Revolutionaries and the Dilemma of Power**, p. 105] This fits
in with Marx's and Engels's repeated equation of universal suffrage with
the political power or political supremacy of the working class. In
other words, *"political power"* simply means the ability to nominate a
government (see [section H.3.10](secH3.html#sech310)).

While Marxists like to portray this new government as *"the dictatorship
of the proletariat,"* anarchist argue that, in fact, it will be the
dictatorship **over** the proletariat. This is because if the working
class **is** the ruling class (as Marxists claim) then, anarchists
argue, how can they delegate their power to a government and remain so?
Either the working class directly manages its own affairs (and so
society) or the government does. Any state is simply rule by a few and
so is incompatible with socialism (we discuss this issue in [section
H.3.7](secH3.html#sech37)). The obvious implication of this is that
Marxism seeks party rule, not working class direct management of society
(as we discuss in [section H.3.8](secH3.html#sech38), the Leninist
tradition is extremely clear on this matter).

Then there is the question of the building blocks of socialism. Yet
again, there is a clear difference between anarchism and Marxism.
Anarchists have always argued that the basis of socialism is working
class organisations, created in the struggle against capitalism and the
state. This applies to both the social and economic structure of a
post-revolutionary society. For most forms of Marxism, a radically
different picture has been the dominant one. As we discuss in [section
H.3.10](secH3.html#sech310), Marxists only reached a similar vision for
the political structure of socialism in 1917 when Lenin supported the
soviets as the framework of his workers' state. However, as we prove in
[section H.3.11](secH3.html#sech311), he did so for instrumental
purposes only, namely as the best means of assuring Bolshevik power. If
the soviets clashed with the party, it was the latter which took
precedence. Unsurprisingly, the Bolshevik mainstream moved from *"All
Power to the Soviets"* to *"dictatorship of the party"* rather quickly.
Thus, unlike anarchism, most forms of Marxism aim for party power, a
"revolutionary" government above the organs of working class
self-management.

Economically, there are also clear differences. Anarchists have
consistently argued that the workers *"ought to be the real managers of
industries."* [Peter Kropotkin, **Fields, Factories and Workshops
Tomorrow**, p. 157] To achieve this, we have pointed to various
organisations over time, such as factory committees and labour unions.
As we discuss in more detail in [section H.3.12](secH3.html#sech312),
Lenin, in contrast, saw socialism as being constructed on the basis of
structures and techniques (including management ones) developed under
capitalism. Rather than see socialism as being built around new, working
class organisations, Lenin saw it being constructed on the basis of
developments in capitalist organisation. *"The Leninist road to
socialism,"* notes one expert on Lenin, *"emphatically ran through the
terrain of monopoly capitalism. It would, according to Lenin, abolish
neither its advanced technological base nor its institutionalised means
for allocating resources or structuring industry. . . The
institutionalised framework of advanced capitalism could, to put it
shortly, be utilised for realisation of specifically socialist goals.
They were to become, indeed, the principal (almost exclusive)
instruments of socialist transformation."* [Neil Harding, **Leninism**,
p.145]

The role of workers' in this vision was basically unchanged. Rather than
demand, like anarchists, workers' self-management of production in 1917,
Lenin raised the demand for *"country-wide, all-embracing workers'
control over the capitalists"* (and this is the *"important thing"*,
**not** *"confiscation of the capitalists' property"*) [**The Lenin
Anthology**, p. 402] Once the Bolsheviks were in power, the workers' own
organs (the factory committees) were integrated into a system of state
control, losing whatever power they once held at the point of
production. Lenin then modified this vision by replacing capitalists
with (state appointed) *"one-man management"* over the workers (see
[section H.3.14](secH3.html#sech314)). In other words, a form of
**state** capitalism in which workers would still be wage slaves under
bosses appointed by the state. Unsurprisingly, the *"control"* workers
exercised over their bosses (i.e. those with **real** power in
production) proved to be as elusive in production as it was in the
state. In this, Lenin undoubtedly followed the lead of the **Communist
Manifesto** which stressed state ownership of the means of production
without a word about workers' self-management of production. As we
discuss in [section H.3.13](secH3.html#sech313), state "socialism"
cannot help being *"state capitalism"* by its very nature.

Needless to say, as far as means go, few anarchists and syndicalists are
complete pacifists. As syndicalist Emile Pouget argued, *"[h]istory
teaches that the privileged have never surrendered their privileges
without having been compelled so to do and forced into it by their
rebellious victims. It is unlikely that the bourgeoisie is blessed with
an exceptional greatness of soul and will abdicate voluntarily"* and so
*"[r]ecourse to force . . . will be required."* [**The Party Of
Labour**] This does not mean that libertarians glorify violence or argue
that all forms of violence are acceptable (quite the reverse!), it
simply means that for self-defence against violent opponents violence
is, unfortunately, sometimes required.

The way an anarchist revolution would defend itself also shows a key
difference between anarchism and Marxism. As we discussed in [section
H.2.1](secH2.html#sech21), anarchists (regardless of Marxist claims)
have always argued that a revolution needs to defend itself. This would
be organised in a federal, bottom-up way as the social structure of a
free society. It would be based on voluntary working class militias.
This model of working class self-defence was applied successfully in
both the Spanish and Ukrainian revolutions (by the CNT-FAI and the
Makhnovists, respectively). In contrast, the Bolshevik method of
defending a revolution was the top-down, hierarchical and centralised
"Red Army". As the example of the Makhnovists showed, the "Red Army" was
not the only way the Russian Revolution could have been defended
although it was the only way Bolshevik power could be.

So while Anarchists have consistently argued that socialism must be
based on working class self-management of production and society based
on working class organisations, the Leninist tradition has not supported
this vision (although it has appropriated some of its imagery to gain
popular support). Clearly, in terms of the immediate aftermath of a
revolution, anarchists and Leninists do not seek the same thing. The
former want a free society organised and run from below-upwards by the
working class based on workers self-management of production while the
latter seek party power in a new state structure which would preside
over an essentially state capitalist economy.

Lastly, there is the question of the long term goal. Even in this vision
of a classless and stateless society there is very little in common
between anarchist communism and Marxist communism, beyond the similar
terminology used to describe it. This is blurred by the differences in
terminology used by both theories. Marx and Engels had raised in the
1840s the (long term) goal of *"an association, in which the free
development of each is the condition for the free development of all"*
replacing *"the old bourgeois society, with its classes and class
antagonisms,"* in the **Communist Manifesto**. Before this *"vast
association of the whole nation"* was possible, the proletariat would be
*"raise[d] . . . to the position of ruling class"* and *"all capital"*
would be *"centralise[d] . . . in the hands of the State, i.e. of the
proletariat organised as the ruling class."* As economic classes would
no longer exist, *"the public power would lose its political character"*
as political power *"is merely the organised power of one class for
oppressing another."* [**Selected Works**, p. 53]

It was this, the means to the end, which was the focus of much debate
(see [section H.1.1](secH1.html#sech11) for details). However, it cannot
be assumed that the ends desired by Marxists and anarchists are
identical. The argument that the *"public power"* could stop being
*"political"* (i.e. a state) is a tautology, and a particularly
unconvincing one at that. After all, if *"political power"* is defined
as being an instrument of class rule it automatically follows that a
classless society would have a non-political *"public power"* and so be
without a state! This does not imply that a *"public power"* would no
longer exist as a structure within (or, more correctly, over) society,
it just implies that its role would no longer be *"political"* (i.e. an
instrument of class rule). Given that, according to the Manifesto, the
state would centralise the means of production, credit and
transportation and then organise it *"in accordance with a common plan"*
using *"industrial armies, especially for agriculture"* this would
suggest that the state structure would remain even after its
*"political"* aspects had, to use Engels words, *"die[d] out."* [Marx
and Engels, **Op. Cit.**, pp. 52-3 and p. 424]

From this perspective, the difference between anarchist communism and
Marxist-communism is clear. *"While both,"* notes John Clark, *"foresee
the disappearance of the state, the achievement of social management of
the economy, the end of class rule, and the attainment of human
equality, to mention a few common goals, significant differences in ends
still remain. Marxist thought has inherited a vision which looks to high
development of technology with a corresponding degree of centralisation
of social institutions which will continue even after the coming of the
social revolution. . . . The anarchist vision sees the human scale as
essential, both in the techniques which are used for production, and for
the institutions which arise from the new modes of association . . . In
addition, the anarchist ideal has a strong hedonistic element which has
seen Germanic socialism as ascetic and Puritanical."* [**The Anarchist
Moment**, p. 68] Thus Marx presents *"a formulation that calls not for
the ultimate abolition of the State but suggests that it will continue
to exist (however differently it is reconstituted by the proletariat) as
a 'nonpolitical' (i.e., administrative) source of authority."* [Murray
Bookchin, **The Ecology of Freedom**, p. 196fn]

Moreover, it is unlikely that such a centralised system could become
stateless and classless in actuality. As Bakunin argued, in the Marxist
state *"there will be no privileged class. Everybody will be equal, not
only from the judicial and political but also from the economic
standpoint. This is the promise at any rate . . . So there will be no
more class, but a government, and, please note, an extremely complicated
government which, not content with governing and administering the
masses politically . . . will also administer them economically, by
taking over the production and **fair** sharing of wealth, agriculture,
the establishment and development of factories, the organisation and
control of trade, and lastly the injection of capital into production by
a single banker, the State."* Such a system would be, in reality, *"the
reign of the **scientific mind,** the most aristocratic, despotic,
arrogant and contemptuous of all regimes"* base on *"a new class, a new
hierarchy of real or bogus learning, and the world will be divided into
a dominant, science-based minority and a vast, ignorant majority."*
[**Michael Bakunin: Selected Writings**, p. 266]

George Barrett's words also seem appropriate:

> *"The modern Socialist . . . have steadily worked for centralisation,
> and complete and perfect organisation and control by those in
> authority above the people. The anarchist, on the other hand, believes
> in the abolition of that central power, and expects the free society
> to grow into existence from below, starting with those organisations
> and free agreements among the people themselves. It is difficult to
> see how, by making a central power control everything, we can be
> making a step towards the abolition of that power."* [**Objections to
> Anarchism**, p. 348]

Indeed, by giving the state increased economic activities it ensures
that this so-called "transitional" state grows with the implementation
of the Marxist programme. Moreover, given the economic tasks the state
now does it hardly makes much sense to assert it will "wither away" -
unless you think that the centralised economic planning which this
regime does also "withers away." Marx argued that once the *"abolition
of classes"* has *"been attained"* then *"the power of the State . . .
disappears, and the functions of government are transformed into simple
administrative functions."* [Marx, Engels and Lenin, **Anarchism and
Anarcho-Syndicalism**, p. 76] In other words, the state apparatus does
not "wither away" rather its function as an instrument of class rule
does. This is an automatic result of classes themselves withering away
as private property is nationalised. Yet as class is defined as being
rooted in ownership of the means of production, this becomes a
meaningless tautology. Obviously, as the state centralises the means of
production into its own hands then (the existing) economic classes cease
to exist and, as a result, the state "disappears." Yet the power and
size of the State is, in fact, increased by this process and so the
elimination of economic classes actually increases the power and size of
the state machine.

As Brain Morris notes, *"Bakunin's fears that under Marx's kind of
socialism the workers would continue to labour under a regimented,
mechanised, hierarchical system of production, without direct control
over their labour, has been more than confirmed by the realities of the
Bolshevik system. Thus, Bakunin's critique of Marxism has taken on an
increasing relevance in the age of bureaucratic State capitalism."*
[**Bakunin: The Philosophy of Freedom**, p. 132] Thus the *"central
confusions of Marxist political theorists"* are found in the discussion
on the state in **The Communist Manifesto**. If class is *"an
exclusively economic category, and if the old conditions of production
are changed so that there is no longer any private ownership of the
means of production, then classes no longer exist by definition when
they are defined in terms of . . . the private ownership of the means of
production . . . If Marx also defines 'political power' as 'the
organised power of one [economic] class for oppressing another', then
the . . . argument is no more than a tautology, and is trivially true."*
Unfortunately, as history has confirmed, *"we cannot conclude . . . if
it is a mere tautology, that with a condition of no private ownership of
the means of production there could be no . . . dominant and subordinate
strata."* [Alan Carter, **Marx: A Radical Critique**, p. 221 and pp.
221-2]

Unsurprisingly, therefore, anarchists are not convinced that a highly
centralised structure (as a state is) managing the economic life of
society can be part of a truly classless society. While economic class
as defined in terms of ownership of the means of production may not
exist, social classes (defined in terms of inequality of power,
authority and control) will continue simply because the state is
designed to create and protect minority rule (see [section
H.3.7](secH3.html#sech37)). As Bolshevik and Stalinist Russia showed,
nationalising the means of production does not end class society. As
Malatesta argued:

> "When F. Engels, perhaps to counter anarchist criticisms, said that
> once classes disappear the State as such has no **raison d'être** and
> transforms itself from a government of men into an administration of

> [**Errico Malatesta: His Life and Ideas**, p. 145]

The anarchist vision of the future society, therefore, does not exactly
match the state communist vision, as much as the latter would like to
suggest it does. The difference between the two is authority, which
cannot be anything but the largest difference possible. Anarchist
economic and organisational theories are built around an
anti-authoritarian core and this informs both our means and aims. For
anarchists, the Leninist vision of socialism is unattractive. Lenin
continually stressed that his conception of socialism and *"state
capitalism"* were basically identical. Even in **State and Revolution**,
allegedly Lenin's most libertarian work, we discover this particularly
unvisionary and uninspiring vision of "socialism":

> *"**All** citizens are transformed into the salaried employees of the
> state . . . **All** citizens become employees and workers of a
> **single** national state 'syndicate' . . . The whole of society will
> have become a single office and a single factory with equality of work
> and equality of pay."* [**Essential Works of Lenin**, p. 348]

To which, anarchists point to Engels and his comments on the tyrannical
and authoritarian character of the modern factory (as we discuss in
[section H.4.4](secH4.html#sech44)). Clearly, Lenin's idea of turning
the world into one big factory takes on an extremely frightening nature
given Engels' lovely vision of the lack of freedom in the workplace.

For these reasons anarchists reject the simplistic Marxist analysis of
inequality being rooted simply in economic class. Such an analysis, as
the comments of Lenin and Engels prove, show that social inequality can
be smuggled in by the backdoor of a proposed classless and stateless
society. Thus Bookchin:

> *"Basic to anti-authoritarian Socialism --specifically, to Anarchist
> Communism - is the notion that hierarchy and domination cannot be
> subsumed by class rule and economic exploitation, indeed, that they
> are more fundamental to an understanding of the modern revolutionary
> project . . . Power of human over human long antedates **the very
> formation of classes and economic modes of social oppression.** . . .
> This much is clear: it will no longer do to insist that a classless
> society, freed from material exploitation, will necessarily be a
> liberated society. There is nothing in the social future to suggest
> that bureaucracy is incompatible with a classless society, the
> domination of women, the young, ethnic groups or even professional
> strata."* [**Toward an Ecological Society**, pp. 208-9]

Ultimately, anarchists see that *"there is a realm of domination that is
broader than the realm of material exploitation. The tragedy of the
socialist movement is that, steeped in the past, it uses the methods of
domination to try to 'liberate' us from material exploitation."*
Needless to say, this is doomed to failure. Socialism *"will simply mire
us in a world we are trying to overcome. A non-hierarchical society,
self-managed and free of domination in all its forms, stands on the
agenda today, not a hierarchical system draped in a red flag."*
[Bookchin, **Op. Cit.**, p. 272 and pp. 273-4]

In summary, it cannot be said that anarchists and most Marxists want the
same thing. While they often use the same terms, these terms often hide
radically different concepts. Just because, say, anarchists and
mainstream Marxists talk about *"social revolution,"* *"socialism,"*
*"all power to the soviets"* and so on, it does not mean that we mean
the same thing by them. For example, the phrase *"all power to the
soviets"* for anarchists means exactly that (i.e. that the revolution
must be directly managed by working class organs). Leninists mean *"all
power to a central government elected by a national soviet congress."*
Similarly with other similar phrases (which shows the importance of
looking at the details of any political theory and its history).

We have shown that discussion over ends is as important as discussion
over means as they are related. As Kropotkin once pointed out, those who
downplay the importance of discussing the *"order of things which . . .
should emerge from the coming revolution"* in favour of concentrating on
*"practical things"* are being less than honest as *"far from making
light of such theories, they propagate them, and all that they do now is
a logical extension of their ideas. In the end those words 'Let us not
discuss theoretical questions' really mean: 'Do not subject our theory
to discussion, but help us to put it into execution.'"* [**Words of a
Rebel**, p. 200]

Hence the need to critically evaluate both ends and means. This shows
the weakness of the common argument that anarchists and Leftists share
some common visions and so we should work with them to achieve those
common things. Who knows what happens after that? As can be seen, this
is not the case. Many aspects of anarchism and Marxism are in opposition
and cannot be considered similar (for example, what a Leninist considers
as socialism is extremely different to what an anarchist thinks it is).
If you consider "socialism" as being a "workers' state" presided over by
a "revolutionary" government, then how can this be reconciled with the
anarchist vision of a federation of self-managed communes and workers'
associations? As the Russian Revolution shows, only by the armed might
of the *"revolutionary"* government crushing the anarchist vision.

The only thing we truly share with these groups is a mutual opposition
to existing capitalism. Having a common enemy does not make someone
friends. Hence anarchists, while willing to work on certain mutual
struggles, are well aware there is substantial differences in both terms
of means and goals. The lessons of revolution in the 20th Century is
that once in power, Leninists will repress anarchists, their current
allies against the capitalist system. This is does not occur by
accident, it flows from the differences in vision between the two
movements, both in terms of means and goals.

H.3.2 Is Marxism *"socialism from below"*?
------------------------------------------

Some Marxists, such as the **International Socialist Tendency**, like to
portray their tradition as being *"socialism from below."* Under
*"socialism from below,"* they place the ideas of Marx, Engels, Lenin
and Trotsky, arguing that they and they alone have continued this, the
true, ideal of socialism (Hal Draper's essay *"The Two Souls of
Socialism"* seems to have been the first to argue along these lines).
They contrast this idea of socialism *"from below"* with *"socialism
from above,"* in which they place reformist socialism (social democracy,
Labourism, etc.), elitist socialism (Lassalle and others who wanted
educated and liberal members of the middle classes to liberate the
working class) and Stalinism (bureaucratic dictatorship over the working
class). Anarchism, it is argued, should be placed in the latter camp,
with Proudhon and Bakunin showing that anarchist libertarianism simply a
*"myth"*.

For those who uphold this idea, *"Socialism from below"* is simply the
self-emancipation of the working class by its own efforts. To anarchist
ears, the claim that Marxism (and in particular Leninism) is socialism
*"from below"* sounds paradoxical, indeed laughable. This is because
anarchists from Proudhon onwards have used the imagery of socialism
being created and run from below upwards. They have been doing so for
far longer than Marxists have. As such, *"socialism from below"* simply
sums up the ***anarchist*** ideal!

Thus we find Proudhon in 1848 talking about being a *"revolutionary
**from below**"* and that every *"serious and lasting Revolution"* was
*"made **from below,** by the people."* A *"Revolution **from above**"*
was *"pure governmentalism,"* *"the negation of collective activity, of
popular spontaneity"* and is *"the oppression of the wills of those
below."* [quoted by George Woodcock, **Pierre-Joseph Proudhon**, p. 143]
For Proudhon, the means of this revolution *"from below"* would be
federations of working class associations for both credit (mutual banks)
and production (workers' associations or co-operatives) as well as
federations of communes (democratically organised communities). The
workers, *"organised among themselves, without the assistance of the
capitalist"* would march by *"[w]ork to the conquest of the world"* by
the *"force of principle."* Thus capitalism would be reformed away by
the actions of the workers themselves. The *"problem of association,"*
Proudhon argued, *"consists in organising . . . the **producers,** and
by this subjecting capital and subordinating power. Such is the war of
liberty against authority, a war of the producer against the
non-producer; a war of equality against privilege . . . An agricultural
and industrial combination must be found by means of which power, today
the ruler of society, shall become its slave."* [quoted by K. Steven
Vincent, **Pierre-Joseph Proudhon and the Rise of French Republican
Socialism**, p. 148 and p. 157] Ultimately, *"any revolution, to be
effective, must be spontaneous and emanate, not from the heads of
authorities, but from the bowels of the people . . . the only connection
between government and labour is that labour, in organising itself, has
the abrogation of governments as its mission."* [Proudhon, **No Gods, No
Masters**, vol. 1, p. 52]

Similarly, Bakunin saw an anarchist revolution as coming *"from below."*
As he put it, *"liberty can be created only by liberty, by an
insurrection of all the people and the voluntary organisation of the
workers from below upward."* [**Statism and Anarchy**, p. 179] Elsewhere
he wrote that *"popular revolution"* would *"create its own organisation
from the bottom upwards and from the circumference inwards, in
accordance with the principle of liberty, and not from the top downwards
and from the centre outwards, as in the way of authority."* [**Michael
Bakunin: Selected Writings**, p. 170] His vision of revolution and
revolutionary self-organisation and construction from below was a core
aspect of his anarchist ideas and he argued repeatedly for *"the free
organisation of the people's lives in accordance with their needs - not
from the top down, as we have it in the State, but from the bottom up,
an organisation formed by the people themselves . . . a free union of
associations of agricultural and factory workers, of communes, regions,
and nations."* He stressed that *"the politics of the Social
Revolution"* was *"the abolition of the State"* and *"the economic,
altogether free organisation of the people, an organisation from below
upward, by means of federation."* [**The Political Philosophy of
Bakunin**, pp. 297-8]

While Proudhon wanted to revolutionise society, he rejected
revolutionary means to do so (i.e. collective struggle, strikes,
insurrection, etc.). Bakunin, however, was a revolutionary in this, the
popular, sense of the word. Yet he shared with Proudhon the idea of
socialism being created by the working class itself. As he put it, in
*"a social revolution, which in everything is diametrically opposed to a
political revolution, the actions of individuals hardly count at all,
whereas the spontaneous action of the masses is everything. All that
individuals can do is clarify, propagate and work out the ideas
corresponding to the popular instinct, and, what is more, to contribute
their incessant efforts to revolutionary organisation of the natural
power of the masses - but nothing else beyond that; the rest can and
should be done by the people themselves . . . revolution can be waged
and brought to its full development only through the spontaneous and
continued mass action of groups and associations of the people."* [**Op.
Cit.**, pp. 298-9]

Therefore, the idea of *"socialism from below"* is a distinctly
anarchist notion, one found in the works of Proudhon and Bakunin and
repeated by anarchists ever since. As such, to hear Marxists appropriate
this obviously anarchist terminology and imagery appears to many
anarchists as opportunistic and attempt to cover the authoritarian
reality of mainstream Marxism with anarchist rhetoric. Moreover, the
attempt to suggest that anarchism is part of the elitist *"socialism
from above"* school rests on little more that selective quoting of
Proudhon and Bakunin (including from Bakunin's pre-anarchist days) to
present a picture of their ideas distinctly at odds with reality.
However, there are "libertarian" strains of Marxism which are close to
anarchism. Does this mean that there are no elements of a *"socialism
from below"* to be found in Marx and Engels?

If we look at Marx, we get contradictory impressions. On the one hand,
he argued that freedom *"consists in converting the state from an organ
superimposed upon society into one completely subordinate to it."*
Combine this with his comments on the Paris Commune (see his *"The Civil
War in France"*), we can say that there are clearly elements of
*"socialism from below"* in Marx's work. On the other hand, he often
stresses the need for strict centralisation of power. In 1850, for
example, he argued that the workers must *"not only strive for a single
and indivisible German republic, but also within this republic for the
most determined centralisation of power in the hands of the state
authority."* This was because *"the path of revolutionary activity"* can
*"proceed only from the centre."* This meant that the workers must be
opposed to the *"federative republic"* planned by the democrats and
*"must not allow themselves to be misguided by the democratic talk of
freedom for the communities, of self-government, etc."* This
centralisation of power was essential to overcome local autonomy, which
would allow *"every village, every town and every province"* to put *"a
new obstacle in the path"* the revolution due to *"local and provincial
obstinacy."* Decades later, Marx dismissed Bakunin's vision of *"the
free organisation of the worker masses from bottom to top"* as
*"nonsense."* [**Marx-Engels Reader**, p. 537, p. 509 and p. 547]

Thus we have a contradiction. While arguing that the state must become
subordinate to society, we have a central power imposing its will on
*"local and provincial obstinacy."* This implies a vision of revolution
in which the centre (indeed, *"the state authority"*) forces its will on
the population, which (by necessity) means that the centre power is
*"superimposed upon society"* rather than *"subordinate"* to it. Given
his dismissal of the idea of organisation from bottom to top, we cannot
argue that by this he meant simply the co-ordination of local
initiatives. Rather, we are struck by the *"top-down"* picture of
revolution Marx presents. Indeed, his argument from 1850 suggests that
Marx favoured centralism not only in order to prevent the masses from
creating obstacles to the revolutionary activity of the *"centre,"* but
also to prevent them from interfering with their own liberation.

Looking at Engels, we discover him writing that *"[a]s soon as our Party
is in possession of political power it has simply to expropriate the big
landed proprietors just like the manufacturers in industry . . . thus
restored to the community [they] are to be turned over by us to the
rural workers who are already cultivating them and are to be organised
into co-operatives."* He even states that this expropriation may *"be
compensated,"* depending on *"the circumstances which we obtain power,
and particularly by the attitude adopted by these gentry."* [**Selected
Writings**, pp. 638-9] Thus we have the party taking power, then
expropriating the means of life **for the workers** and, lastly,
*"turning over"* these to them. While this fits into the general scheme
of the **Communist Manifesto**, it cannot be said to be *"socialism from
below"* which can only signify the direct expropriation of the means of
production by the workers themselves, organising themselves into free
producer associations to do so.

It may be argued that Marx and Engels did not exclude such a solution to
the social question. For example, we find Engels stating that *"the
question is not whether the proletariat when it comes to power will
simply seize by force the tools of production, the raw materials and
means of subsistence"* or *"whether it will redeem property therein by
instalments spread over a long period."* To attempt to predict this
*"for all cases would be utopia-making."* [**Collected Works**, vol. 23,
p. 386] However, Engels is assuming that the social revolution (the
proletariat *"com[ing] to power"*) comes **before** the social
revolution (the seizure of the means of production). In this, we can
assume that it is the "revolutionary" government which does the seizing
(or redeeming) rather than rebel workers.

This vision of revolution as the party coming to power can be seen from
Engels' warning that the *"worse thing that can befall the leader of an
extreme party is to be compelled to assume power at a time when the
movement is not yet ripe for the domination of the class he represents
and for the measures this domination implies."* [**Op. Cit.**, vol. 10,
p. 469] Needless to say, such a vision is hard to equate with
*"socialism from below"* which implies the active participation of the
working class in the direct management of society from the bottom-up. If
the leaders *"assume power"* then **they** have the real power, not the
class they claim to *"represent."* Equally, it seems strange that
socialism can be equated with a vision which equates *"domination"* of a
class being achieved by the fact a leader *"represents"* it. Can the
working class really be said to be the ruling class if its role in
society is to select those who exercise power on its behalf (i.e. to
elect representatives)? Bakunin quite rightly answered in the negative.
While representative democracy may be acceptable to ensure bourgeois
rule, it cannot be assumed that it can be utilised to create a socialist
society. It was designed to defend class society and its centralised and
top-down nature reflects this role.

Moreover, Marx and Engels had argued in **The Holy Family** that the
*"question is not what this or that proletarian, or even the whole of
the proletariat at the moment **considers** as its aim. The question is
**what the proletariat is**, and what, consequent on that **being**, it
will be compelled to do."* [quoted by Murray Bookchin, **The Spanish
Anarchists**, p. 280] As Murray Bookchin argued:

> *"These lines and others like them in Marx's writings were to provide
> the rationale for asserting the authority of Marxist parties and their
> armed detachments over and even against the proletariat. Claiming a
> deeper and more informed comprehension of the situation than 'even the
> whole of the proletariat at the given moment,' Marxist parties went on
> to dissolve such revolutionary forms of proletarian organisation as
> factory committees and ultimately to totally regiment the proletariat
> according to lines established by the party leadership."* [**Op.
> Cit.**, p. 289]

Thus the ideological underpinning of a *"socialism from above"* is
expounded, one which dismisses what the members of the working class
actually want or desire at a given point (a position which Trotsky, for
one, explicitly argued). A few years later, they argued in **The
Communist Manifesto** that *"a portion of the bourgeois goes over to the
proletariat, and in particular, a portion of the bourgeois ideologists,
who have raised themselves to the level of comprehending theoretically
the historical movement as a whole."* They also noted that the
Communists are *"the most advanced and resolute section of the
working-class parties"* and *"they have over the great mass of the
proletariat the advantage of clearly understanding the line of march,
the conditions, and the general results of the proletarian movement."*
This gives a privileged place to the party (particularly the *"bourgeois
ideologists"* who join it), a privileged place which their followers had
no problem abusing in favour of party power and hierarchical leadership
from above. As we discuss in [section H.5](secH5.html), Lenin was just
expressing orthodox Social-Democratic (i.e. Marxist) policy when he
argued that socialist consciousness was created by bourgeois
intellectuals and introduced into the working class from outside.
Against this, we have to note that the Manifesto states that the
proletarian movement was *"the self-conscious, independent movement of
the immense majority, in the interests of the immense majority"*
(although, as discussed in [section H.1.1](secH1.html#sech11), when they
wrote this the proletariat was a **minority** in all countries bar
Britain). [**Selected Works**, p. 44, p. 46 and p. 45]

Looking at the tactics advocated by Marx and Engels, we see a strong
support for *"political action"* in the sense of participating in
elections. This support undoubtedly flows from Engels's comments that
universal suffrage *"in an England two-thirds of whose inhabitants are
industrial proletarians means the exclusive political rule of the
working class with all the revolutionary changes in social conditions
which are inseparable from it."* [**Collected Works**, vol. 10, p. 298]
Marx, likewise, repeatedly argued along identical lines. For example, in
1855, he stated that *"universal suffrage . . . implies the assumption
of political power as means of satisfying [the workers'] social means"*
and, in Britain, *"revolution is the direct content of universal
suffrage."* [**Op. Cit.**, vol. 11, pp. 335-6] Yet how could an entire
class, the proletariat organised as a *"movement"* exercise its power
under such a system? While the atomised voting to nominate
representatives (who, in reality, held the real power in society) may be
more than adequate to ensure bourgeois, i.e. minority, power, could it
be used for working class, i.e. majority, power?

This seems highly unlikely because such institutions are designed to
place policy-making in the hands of representatives and were created
explicitly to **exclude** mass participation in order to ensure
bourgeois control (see [section B.2.5](secB2.html#secb25)). They do not
(indeed, cannot) constitute a *"proletariat organised as a ruling
class."* If public policy, as distinguished from administrative
activities, is not made by the people themselves, in federations of
self-managed assemblies, then a movement of the vast majority does not,
cannot, exist. For people to acquire real power over their lives and
society, they must establish institutions organised and run, as Bakunin
constantly stressed, from below. This would necessitate that they
themselves directly manage their own affairs, communities and workplaces
and, for co-ordination, mandate federal assemblies of revocable and
strictly controllable delegates, who will execute their decisions. Only
in this sense can a majority class, especially one committed to the
abolition of all classes, organise as a class to manage society.

As such, Marx and Engels tactics are at odds with any idea of
*"socialism from below."* While, correctly, supporting strikes and other
forms of working class direct action (although, significantly, Engels
dismissed the general strike) they placed that support within a general
political strategy which emphasised electioneering and representative
forms. This, however, is a form of struggle which can only really be
carried out by means of leaders. The role of the masses is minor, that
of voters. The focus of the struggle is at the top, in parliament, where
the duly elected leaders are. As Luigi Galleani argued, this form of
action involved the *"ceding of power by all to someone, the delegate,
the representative, individual or group."* This meant that rather than
the anarchist tactic of *"direct pressure put against the ruling classes
by the masses,"* the Socialist Party *"substituted representation and
the rigid discipline of the parliamentary socialists,"* which inevitably
resulted in it *"adopt[ing] class collaboration in the legislative
arena, without which all reforms would remain a vain hope."* It also
resulted in the socialists needing *"authoritarian organisations"*, i.e.
ones which are centralised and disciplined from above down. [**The End
of Anarchism?**, p. 14, p. 12 and p. 14] The end result was the
encouragement of a viewpoint that reforms (indeed, the revolution) would
be the work of leaders acting on behalf of the masses whose role would
be that of voters and followers, not active participants in the struggle
(see [section J.2](secJ2.html) for a discussion on direct action and why
anarchists reject electioneering).

By the 1890s, the top-down and essentially reformist nature of these
tactics had made their mark in both Engels' politics and the practical
activities of the Social-Democratic parties. Engels *"introduction"* to
Marx's **The Class Struggles in France** indicated how far Marxism had
progressed and undoubtedly influenced by the rise of Social-Democracy as
an electoral power, it stressed the use of the ballot box as the ideal
way, if not the only way, for the party to take power. He noted that
*"[w]e, the 'revolutionists', the 'overthrowers'"* were *"thriving far
better on legal methods than on illegal methods and overthrow"* and the
bourgeoisie *"cry despairingly . . . legality is the death of us"* and
were *"much more afraid of the legal than of the illegal action of the
workers' party, of the results of elections than of those of
rebellion."* He argued that it was essential *"not to fitter away this
daily increasing shock force [of party voters] in vanguard skirmishes,
but to keep it intact until the decisive day."* [**Selected Writings**,
p. 656, p. 650 and p. 655]

The net effect of this would simply be keeping the class struggle within
the bounds decided upon by the party leaders, so placing the emphasis on
the activities and decisions of those at the top rather than the
struggle and decisions of the mass of working class people themselves.
As we noted in [section H.1.1](secH1.html#sech11), when the party was
racked by the *"revisionism"* controversy after Engels death, it was
fundamentally a conflict between those who wanted the party's rhetoric
to reflect its reformist tactics and those who sought the illusion of
radical words to cover the reformist practice. The decision of the Party
leadership to support their state in the First World War simply proved
that radical words cannot defeat reformist tactics.

Needless to say, from this contradictory inheritance Marxists had two
ways of proceeding. Either they become explicitly anti-state (and so
approach anarchism) or become explicitly in favour of party and state
power and so, by necessity, *"revolution from above."* The council
communists and other libertarian Marxists followed the first path, the
Bolsheviks and their followers the second. As we discuss in the [next
section](secH3.html#sech33), Lenin explicitly dismissed the idea that
Marxism proceeded *"only from below,"* stating that this was an
anarchist principle. Nor was he shy in equating party power with working
class power. Indeed, this vision of socialism as involving party power
was not alien to the mainstream social-democracy Leninism split from.
The leading left-wing Menshevik Martov argued as follows:

> *"In a class struggle which has entered the phase of civil war, there
> are bound to be times when the advance guard of the revolutionary
> class, representing the interests of the broad masses but ahead of
> them in political consciousness, is obliged to exercise state power by
> means of a dictatorship of the revolutionary minority. Only a
> short-sighted and doctrinaire viewpoint would reject this prospect as
> such. The real question at stake is whether this dictatorship, which
> is unavoidable at a certain stage of any revolution, is exercised in
> such a way as to consolidate itself and create a system of
> institutions enabling it to become a permanent feature, or whether, on
> the contrary, it is replaced as soon as possible by the organised
> initiative and autonomy of the revolutionary class or classes as a
> whole. The second of these methods is that of the revolutionary
> Marxists who, for this reason, style themselves Social Democrats; the
> first is that of the Communists."* [**The Mensheviks in the Russian
> Revolution**, Abraham Ascher (ed.), p. 119]

All this is to be expected, given the weakness of the Marxist theory of
the state. As we discuss in [section H.3.7](secH3.html#sech37), Marxists
have always had an a-historic perspective on the state, considering it
as purely an instrument of class rule rather than what it is, an
instrument of **minority** class rule. For anarchists, the *"State is
the minority government, from the top downward, of a vast quantity of
men."* This automatically means that a socialism, like Marx's, which
aims for a socialist government and a workers' state automatically
becomes, against the wishes of its best activists, *"socialism from
above."* As Bakunin argued, Marxists are *"worshippers of State power,
and necessarily also prophets of political and social discipline and
champions of order established from the top downwards, always in the
name of universal suffrage and the sovereignty of the masses, for whom
they save the honour and privilege of obeying leaders, elected
masters."* [**Michael Bakunin: Selected Writings**, p. 265 and pp.
237-8]

For this reason anarchists from Bakunin onwards have argued for a
bottom-up federation of workers' councils as the basis of revolution and
the means of managing society after capitalism and the state have been
abolished. If these organs of workers' self-management are co-opted into
a state structure (as happened in Russia) then their power will be
handed over to the real power in any state - the government and its
bureaucracy. The state is the delegation of power - as such, it means
that the idea of a *"workers' state"* expressing *"workers' power"* is a
logical impossibility. If workers are running society then power rests
in their hands. If a state exists then power rests in the hands of the
handful of people at the top, not in the hands of all. The state was
designed for minority rule. No state can be an organ of working class
(i.e. majority) self-management due to its basic nature, structure and
design.

So, while there are elements of *"socialism from below"* in the works of
Marx and Engels they are placed within a distinctly centralised and
authoritarian context which undermines them. As John Clark summarises,
*"in the context of Marx's consistent advocacy of centralist programmes,
and the part these programmes play in his theory of social development,
the attempt to construct a **libertarian** Marxism by citing Marx's own
proposals for social change would seem to present insuperable
difficulties."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 93]

H.3.3 Is Leninism *"socialism from below"*?
-------------------------------------------

As discussed in the [last section](secH3.html#sech32), Marx and Engels
left their followers with an ambiguous legacy. On the one hand, there
**are** elements of *"socialism from below"* in their politics (most
explicitly in Marx's comments on the libertarian influenced Paris
Commune). On the other, there are distinctly centralist and statist
themes in their work.

From this legacy, Leninism took the statist themes. This explains why
anarchists think the idea of Leninism being *"socialism from below"* is
incredible. Simply put, the actual comments and actions of Lenin and his
followers show that they had no commitment to a *"socialism from
below."* As we will indicate, Lenin disassociated himself repeatedly
from the idea of politics *"from below,"* considering it (quite rightly)
an anarchist idea. In contrast, he stressed the importance of a politics
which somehow combined action *"from above"* and *"from below."* For
those Leninists who maintain that their tradition is *"socialism from
below"* (indeed, the only *"real"* socialism *"from below"*), this is a
major problem and, unsurprisingly, they generally fail to mention it.

So what was Lenin's position on *"from below"*? In 1904, during the
debate over the party split into Bolsheviks and Mensheviks, Lenin stated
that the argument *"[b]ureaucracy **versus** democracy is in fact
centralism **versus** autonomism; it is the organisational principle of
revolutionary Social-Democracy as opposed to the organisational
principle of opportunist Social-Democracy. The latter strives to proceed
from the bottom upward, and, therefore, wherever possible . . . upholds
autonomism and 'democracy,' carried (by the overzealous) to the point of
anarchism. The former strives to proceed from the top downward."*
[**Collected Works**, vol. 7, pp. 396-7] Thus it is the non-Bolshevik
(*"opportunist"*) wing of Marxism which bases itself on the
*"organisational principle"* of *"from the bottom upward,"* not the
Bolshevik tradition (as we note in [section H.5.5](secH5.html#sech55),
Lenin also rejected the *"primitive democracy"* of mass assemblies as
the basis of the labour and revolutionary movements). Moreover, this
vision of a party run from the top down was enshrined in the Bolshevik
ideal of *"democratic centralism"*. How you can have *"socialism from
below"* when your *"organisational principle"* is *"from the top
downward"* is not explained by Leninist exponents of *"socialism from
below."*

Lenin repeated this argument in his discussion on the right tactics to
apply during the near revolution of 1905. He mocked the Mensheviks for
only wanting *"pressure from below"* which was *"pressure by the
citizens on the revolutionary government."* Instead, he argued for
*"pressure . . . from above as well as from below,"* where *"pressure
from above"* was *"pressure by the revolutionary government on the
citizens."* He notes that Engels *"appreciated the importance of action
from above"* and that he saw the need for *"the utilisation of the
revolutionary governmental power."* Lenin summarised his position (which
he considered as being in line with that of orthodox Marxism) by
stating: *"Limitation, in principle, of revolutionary action to pressure
from below and renunciation of pressure also from above is
**anarchism.**"* [**Op. Cit.**, vol. 8, p. 474, p. 478, p. 480 and p.
481] This seems to have been a common Bolshevik position at the time,
with Stalin stressing in the same year that *"action only from 'below'"*
was *"an anarchist principle, which does, indeed, fundamentally
contradict Social-Democratic tactics."* [**Collected Works**, vol. 1, p.
149]

It is in this context of *"above and below"* in which we must place
Lenin's comments in 1917 that socialism was *"democracy from below,
without a police, without a standing army, voluntary social duty by a
**militia** formed from a universally armed people."* [**Op. Cit.**,
vol. 24, p. 170] Given that Lenin had rejected the idea of *"only from
below"* as an anarchist principle (which it is), we need to bear in mind
that this *"democracy from below"* was **always** placed in the context
of a Bolshevik government. Lenin always stressed that the *"Bolsheviks
must assume power."* The Bolsheviks *"can and **must** take state power
into their own hands."* He raised the question of *"will the Bolsheviks
dare take over full state power alone?"* and answered it: *"I have
already had occasion . . . to answer this question in the affirmative."*
Moreover, *"a political party . . . would have no right to exist, would
be unworthy of the name of party . . . if it refused to take power when
opportunity offers."* [**Op. Cit.**, vol. 26, p. 19 and p. 90] Lenin's
*"democracy from below"* always meant representative government, **not**
popular power or self-management. The role of the working class was that
of voters and so the Bolsheviks' first task was *"to convince the
majority of the people that its programme and tactics are correct."* The
second task *"that confronted our Party was to capture political
power."* The third task was for *"the Bolshevik Party"* to
*"**administer** Russia,"* to be the *"governing party."* [**Op. Cit.**,
vol. 27, pp. 241-2] Thus Bolshevik power was equated with working class
power.

Towards the end of 1917, he stressed this vision of a Bolshevik run
*"democracy from below"* by arguing that since *"the 1905 revolution
Russia has been governed by 130,000 landowners . . . Yet we are told
that the 240,000 members of the Bolshevik party will not be able to
govern Russia, govern her in the interests of the poor."* He even
equated rule by the party with rule by the class, noting that
*"proletarian revolutionary power"* and *Bolshevik power"* are *"now one
the same thing."* He admitted that the proletariat could not actually
govern itself for *"[w]e know that an unskilled labourer or a cook
cannot immediately get on with the job of state administration . . . We
demand that **training** in th[is] work . . . be conducted by the
class-conscious workers and soldiers."* The *"class-conscious workers
must lead, but for the work of administration they can enlist the vast
mass of the working and oppressed people."* Thus democratic sounding
rhetoric, in reality, hide the fact that the party would govern (i.e.,
have power) and working people would simply administer the means by
which its decisions would be implemented. Lenin also indicated that once
in power, the Bolsheviks *"shall be fully and unreservedly in favour of
a strong state power and of centralism."* [**Op. Cit.**, vol. 26, p.
111, p. 179, p. 113, p. 114 and p. 116]

Clearly, Lenin's position had not changed. The goal of the revolution
was simply a Bolshevik government, which, if it were to be effective,
had to have the real power in society. Thus, socialism would be
implemented from above, by the *"strong"* and centralised government of
the *"class-conscious workers"* who would *"lead"* and so the party
would *"govern"* Russia, in the *"interests"* of the masses. Rather than
govern themselves, they would be subject to *"the power of the
Bolsheviks"*. While, eventually, the *"working"* masses would take part
in the administration of state decisions, their role would be the same
as under capitalism as, we must note, there is a difference between
making policy and carrying it out, between the *"work of
administration"* and governing, a difference Lenin obscures. In fact,
the name of this essay clearly shows who would be in control under
Lenin: *"Can the Bolsheviks retain State Power?"*

As one expert noted, the Bolsheviks made *"a distinction between the
execution of policy and the making of policy. The 'broad masses' were to
be the executors of state decrees, not the formulators of legislation."*
However, by *"claiming to draw 'all people' into [the state]
administration, the Bolsheviks claimed also that they were providing a
greater degree of democracy than the parliamentary state."* [Frederick
I. Kaplan, **Bolshevik Ideology and the Ethics of Soviet Labor**, p.
212] The difference is important. Ante Ciliga, once a political prisoner
under Stalin, once noted how the secret police *"liked to boast of the
working class origin of its henchmen."* He quoted a fellow prisoner, and
ex-Tsarist convict, who retorted: *"You are wrong if you believe that in
the days of the Tsar the gaolers were recruited from among dukes and the
executioners from among the princes!"* [**The Russian Enigma**, pp.
255-6]

All of which explains the famous leaflet addressed to the workers of
Petrograd immediately after the October Revolution, informing them that
*"the revolution has won."* The workers were called upon to *"show . . .
**the greatest firmness and endurance,** in order to facilitate the
execution of all the aims of the new People's Government."* They were
asked to *"cease immediately all economic and political strikes, to take
up your work, and do it in perfect order . . . All to your places"* as
the *"best way to support the new Government of Soviets in these days"*
was *"by doing your job."* [quoted by John Read, **Ten Days that Shook
the World**, pp. 341-2] Which smacks far more of *"socialism from
above"* than *"socialism from below"*!

The implications of Lenin's position became clearer after the Bolsheviks
had taken power. Now it was the concrete situation of a "revolutionary"
government exercising power *"from above"* onto the very class it
claimed to represent. As Lenin explained to his political police, the
Cheka, in 1920:

> *"Without revolutionary coercion directed against the avowed enemies
> of the workers and peasants, it is impossible to break down the
> resistance of these exploiters. On the other hand, revolutionary
> coercion is bound to be employed towards the wavering and unstable
> elements among the masses themselves."* [**Op. Cit.**, vol. 42, p.
> 170]

It could be argued that this position was forced on Lenin by the
problems facing the Bolsheviks in the Civil War, but such an argument is
flawed. This is for two main reasons. Firstly, according to Lenin
himself civil war was inevitable and so, unsurprisingly, Lenin
considered his comments as universally applicable. Secondly, this
position fits in well with the idea of pressure *"from above"* exercised
by the "revolutionary" government against the masses (and nothing to do
with any sort of *"socialism from below"*). Indeed, *"wavering"* and
*"unstable"* elements is just another way of saying *"pressure from
below,"* the attempts by those subject to the "revolutionary" government
to influence its policies. As we noted in [section
H.1.2](secH1.html#sech12), it was in this period (1919 and 1920) that
the Bolsheviks openly argued that the *"dictatorship of the
proletariat"* was, in fact, the *"dictatorship of the party"* (see
[section H.3.8](secH3.html#sech38) on how the Bolsheviks modified the
Marxist theory of the state in line with this). Rather than the result
of the problems facing Russia at the time, Lenin's comments simply
reflect the unfolding of certain aspects of his ideology when his party
held power (as we make clear in [section H.6"](secH6.html) the ideology
of the ruling party and the ideas held by the masses are also factors in
history).

To show that Lenin's comments were not caused by circumstantial factors,
we can turn to his infamous work **Left-Wing Communism**. In this 1920
tract, written for the Second Congress of the Communist International,
Lenin lambasted those Marxists who argued for direct working class power
against the idea of party rule (i.e. the various council communists
around Europe). We have already noted in [section
H.1.2](secH1.html#sech12) that Lenin had argued in that work that it was
*"ridiculously absurd, and stupid"* to *"a contrast, **in general**,
between the dictatorship of the masses and the dictatorship of the
leaders."* [**The Lenin Anthology**, p. 568] Here we provide his
description of the *"top-down"* nature of Bolshevik rule:

> "In Russia today, the connection between leaders, party, class and
> masses . . . are concretely as follows: the dictatorship is exercised
> by the proletariat organised in the Soviets and is guided by the
> Communist Party . . . The Party, which holds annual congresses . . .,
> is directed by a Central Committee of nineteen elected at the
> congress, while the current work in Moscow has to be carried on by
> [two] still smaller bodies . . . which are elected at the plenary
> sessions of the Central Committee, five members of the Central
> Committee to each bureau. This, it would appear, is a full-fledged
> 'oligarchy.' No important political or organisational question is
> decided by any state institution in our republic [sic!] without the
> guidance of the Party's Central Committee.
> "In its work, the Party relies directly on the **trade unions**, which
> . . .have a membership of over four million and are formally
> **non-Party**. Actually, all the directing bodies of the vast majority
> of the unions . . . are made up of Communists, and carry out of all
> the directives of the Party. Thus . . . we have a formally
> non-communist . . . very powerful proletarian apparatus, by means of
> which the Party is closely linked up with the **class** and **the
> masses,** and by means of which, under the leadership of the Party,
> the **class dictatorship** of the class is exercised." [**Op. Cit.**,
> pp. 571-2]

This was *"the general mechanism of the proletarian state power viewed
'from above,' from the standpoint of the practical realisation of the
dictatorship"* and so *"all this talk about 'from above' **or** 'from
below,' about 'the dictatorship of leaders' **or** 'the dictatorship of
the masses,'"* is *"ridiculous and childish nonsense."* [**Op. Cit.**,
p. 573] Lenin, of course, did not bother to view *"proletarian"* state
power *"from below,"* from the viewpoint of the proletariat. If he had,
perhaps he would have recounted the numerous strikes and protests broken
by the Cheka under martial law, the gerrymandering and disbanding of
soviets, the imposition of *"one-man management"* onto the workers in
production, the turning of the unions into agents of the state/party and
the elimination of working class freedom by party power? Which suggests
that there are fundamental differences, at least for the masses, between
*"from above"* and *"from below."*

At the Comintern congress itself, Zinoviev announced that *"the
dictatorship of the proletariat is at the same time the dictatorship of
the Communist Party."* [**Proceedings and Documents of the Second
Congress 1920**, vol. 1, p. 152] Trotsky also universalised Lenin's
argument when he pondered the important decisions of the revolution and
who would make them in his reply to the delegate from the Spanish
anarcho-syndicalist union the CNT:

> *"Who decides this question [and others like it]? We have the Council
> of People's Commissars but it has to be subject to some supervision.
> Whose supervision? That of the working class as an amorphous, chaotic
> mass? No. The Central Committee of the party is convened to discuss .
> . . and to decide . . . Who will solve these questions in Spain? The
> Communist Party of Spain."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 174]

As is obvious, Trotsky was drawing general lessons from the Russian
Revolution for the international revolutionary movement. Needless to
say, he still argued that the *"working class, represented and led by
the Communist Party, [was] in power here"* in spite of it being *"an
amorphous, chaotic mass"* which did not make any decisions on important
questions affecting the revolution!

Incidentally, his and Lenin's comments of 1920 disprove Trotsky's later
assertion that it was *"[o]nly after the conquest of power, the end of
the civil war, and the establishment of a stable regime"* when *"the
Central Committee little by little begin to concentrate the leadership
of Soviet activity in its hands. Then would come Stalin's turn."*
[**Stalin**, vol. 1, p. 328] While it was definitely the *"conquest of
power"* by the Bolsheviks which lead to the marginalisation of the
soviets, this event cannot be shunted to after the civil war as Trotsky
would like (particularly as Trotsky admitted that in 1917 *"[a]fter
eight months of inertia and of democratic chaos, came the dictatorship
of the Bolsheviks."* [**Op. Cit.**, vol. 2, p. 242]). We must note
Trotsky argued for the *"objective necessity"* of the *"revolutionary
dictatorship of a proletarian party"* well into the 1930s (see [section
H.1.2](secH1.html#sech12)) .

Clearly, the claim that Leninism (and its various off-shoots like
Trotskyism) is *"socialism from below"* is hard to take seriously. As
proven above, the Leninist tradition is explicitly against the idea of
*"only from below,"* with Lenin explicitly stating that it was an
*"anarchist stand"* to be for *"'action only from below', not 'from
below and from above'"* which was the position of Marxism. [**Collected
Works**, vol. 9, p. 77] Once in power, Lenin and the Bolsheviks
implemented this vision of *"from below and from above,"* with the
highly unsurprising result that *"from above"* quickly repressed *"from
below"* (which was dismissed as *"wavering"* by the masses). This was to
be expected, for a government to enforce its laws, it has to have power
over its citizens and so socialism *"from above"* is a necessary
side-effect of Leninist theory.

Ironically, Lenin's argument in **State and Revolution** comes back to
haunt him. In that work he had argued that the *"dictatorship of the
proletariat"* meant *"democracy for the people"* which *"imposes a
series of restrictions on the freedom of the oppressors, the exploiters,
the capitalists."* These must be crushed *"in order to free humanity
from wage-slavery; their resistance must be broken by force; it is clear
that where there is suppression there is also violence, there is no
freedom, no democracy."* [**Essential Works of Lenin**, pp. 337-8] If
the working class itself is being subject to *"suppression"* then,
clearly, there is *"no freedom, no democracy"* for that class - and the
people *"will feel no better if the stick with which they are being
beaten is labelled 'the people's stick'."* [Bakunin, **Bakunin on
Anarchism**, p. 338]

So when Leninists argue that they stand for the *"principles of
socialism from below"* and state that this means the direct and
democratic control of society by the working class then, clearly, they
are being less than honest. Looking at the tradition they place
themselves, the obvious conclusion which must be reached is that
Leninism is **not** based on *"socialism from below"* in the sense of
working class self-management of society (i.e. the only condition when
the majority can *"rule"* and decisions truly flow from below upwards).
At best, they subscribe to the distinctly bourgeois vision of
*"democracy"* as being simply the majority designating (and trying to
control) its rulers. At worse, they defend politics which have
eliminated even this form of democracy in favour of party dictatorship
and *"one-man management"* armed with *"dictatorial"* powers in industry
(most members of such parties do not know how the Bolsheviks
gerrymandered and disbanded soviets to maintain power, raised the
dictatorship of the party to an ideological truism and wholeheartedly
advocated *"one-man management"* rather than workers' self-management of
production). As we discuss in [section H.5](secH5.html), this latter
position flows easily from the underlying assumptions of vanguardism
which Leninism is based on.

So, Lenin, Trotsky and so on simply cannot be considered as exponents of
*"socialism from below."* Any one who makes such a claim is either
ignorant of the actual ideas and practice of Bolshevism or they seek to
deceive. For anarchists, *"socialism from below"* can only be another
name, like libertarian socialism, for anarchism (as Lenin, ironically
enough, acknowledged). This does not mean that *"socialism from below,"*
like *"libertarian socialism,"* is identical to anarchism, it simply
means that libertarian Marxists and other socialists are far closer to
anarchism than mainstream Marxism.

H.3.4 Don't anarchists just quote Marxists selectively?
-------------------------------------------------------

No, far from it. While it is impossible to quote everything a person or
an ideology says, it is possible to summarise those aspects of a theory
which influenced the way it developed in practice. As such, **any**
account is *"selective"* in some sense, the question is whether this
results in a critique rooted in the ideology and its practice or whether
it presents a picture at odds with both. As Maurice Brinton put it in
the introduction to his classic account of workers' control in the
Russian Revolution:

> *"Other charges will also be made. The quotations from Lenin and
> Trotsky will not be denied but it will be stated that they are
> 'selective' and that 'other things, too' were said. Again, we plead
> guilty. But we would stress that there are hagiographers enough in the
> trade whose 'objectivity' . . . is but a cloak for sophisticated
> apologetics . . . It therefore seems more relevant to quote those
> statements of the Bolshevik leaders of 1917 which helped determine
> Russia's evolution [towards Stalinism] rather those other statements
> which, like the May Day speeches of Labour leaders, were forever to
> remain in the realm of rhetoric."* [**The Bolsheviks and Workers'
> Control**, p. xv]

Hence the need to discuss all aspects of Marxism rather than take what
its adherents like to claim for it as granted. In this, we agree with
Marx himself who argued that we cannot judge people by what they say
about themselves but rather what they do. Unfortunately while many
self-proclaimed Marxists (like Trotsky) may quote these comments, fewer
apply them to their own ideology or actions (again, like Trotsky).

This can be seen from the almost ritualistic way many Marxists response
to anarchist (or other) criticisms of their ideas. When they complain
that anarchists *"selectively"* quote from the leading proponents of
Marxism, they are usually at pains to point people to some document
which they have selected as being more *"representative"* of their
tradition. Leninists usually point to Lenin's **State and Revolution**,
for example, for a vision of what Lenin *"really"* wanted. To this
anarchists reply by, as we discussed in [section
H.1.7](secH1.html#sech17), pointing out that much of that passes for
'Marxism' in **State and Revolution** is anarchist and, equally
important, it was not applied in practice. This explains an apparent
contradiction. Leninists point to the Russian Revolution as evidence for
the democratic nature of their politics. Anarchists point to it as
evidence of Leninism's authoritarian nature. Both can do this because
there is a substantial difference between Bolshevism before it took
power and afterwards. While the Leninists ask you to judge them by their
manifesto, anarchists say judge them by their record!

Simply put, Marxists quote selectively from their own tradition,
ignoring those aspects of it which would be unappealing to potential
recruits. While the leaders may know their tradition has skeletons in
its closet, they try their best to ensure no one else gets to know.
Which, of course, explains their hostility to anarchists doing so! That
there is a deep divide between aspects of Marxist rhetoric and its
practice and that even its rhetoric is not consistent we will now prove.
By so doing, we can show that anarchists do not, in fact, quote
Marxist's *"selectively."*

As an example, we can point to the leading Bolshevik Grigorii Zinoviev.
In 1920, as head of the Communist International he wrote a letter to the
**Industrial Workers of the World**, a revolutionary labour union, which
stated that the *"Russian Soviet Republic . . . is the most highly
centralised government that exists. It is also the most democratic
government in history. For all the organs of government are in constant
touch with the working masses, and constantly sensitive to their will."*
The same year he explained to the Second Congress of the Communist
International that *"[t]oday, people like Kautsky come along and say
that in Russia you do not have the dictatorship of the working class but
the dictatorship of the party. They think this is a reproach against us.
Not in the least! We have a dictatorship of the working class and that
is precisely why we also have a dictatorship of the Communist Party. The
dictatorship of the Communist Party is only a function, an attribute, an
expression of the dictatorship of the working class . . . [T]he
dictatorship of the proletariat is at the same time the dictatorship of
the Communist Party."* [**Proceedings and Documents of the Second
Congress 1920**, vol. 2, p. 928 and pp. 151-2]

It seems redundant to note that the second quote is the accurate one,
the one which matches the reality of Bolshevik Russia. Therefore it is
hardly *"selective"* to quote the latter and not the former, as it
expresses the reality of Bolshevism rather than its rhetoric.

This duality and the divergence between practice and rhetoric comes to
the fore when Trotskyists discuss Stalinism and try to counter pose the
Leninist tradition to it. For example, we find the British SWP's Chris
Harman arguing that the *"whole experience of the workers' movement
internationally teaches that only by regular elections, combined with
the right of recall by shop-floor meetings can rank-and-file delegates
be made really responsible to those who elect them."* [**Bureaucracy and
Revolution in Eastern Europe**, pp. 238-9] Significantly, Harman does
not mention that both Lenin and Trotsky rejected this experience once in
power. As we discuss in [section H.3.8](secH3.html#sech38), Leninism
came not only to practice but to argue theoretically for state power
explicitly to eliminate such control from below. How can the numerous
statements of leading Leninists (including Lenin and Trotsky) on the
necessity of party dictatorship be reconciled with it?

The ironies do not stop there, of course. Harman correctly notes that
under Stalinism, the *"bureaucracy is characterised, like the private
capitalist class in the West, by its control over the means of
production."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 147] However, he fails to note that it
was **Lenin,** in early 1918, who had raised and then implemented such
*"control"* in the form of *"one-man management."* As he put it:
*"Obedience, and unquestioning obedience at that, during work to the
one-man decisions of Soviet directors, of the dictators elected or
appointed by Soviet institutions, vested with dictatorial powers."*
[**Collected Works**, vol. 27, p. 316] To **fail** to note this link
between Lenin and the Stalinist bureaucracy on this issue is quoting
*"selectively."*

The contradictions pile up. Harman argues that *"people who seriously
believe that workers at the height of revolution need a police guard to
stop them handing their factories over to capitalists certainly have no
real faith in the possibilities of a socialist future."* [**Op. Cit.**,
p. 144] Yet this does not stop him praising the regime of Lenin and
Trotsky and contrasting it with Stalinism, in spite of the fact that
this was precisely what the Bolsheviks **did** from 1918 onwards! Indeed
this tyrannical practice played a role in provoking the strikes in
Petrograd which preceded the Kronstadt revolt in 1921, when *"the
workers wanted the special squads of armed Bolsheviks, who carried out a
purely police function, withdrawn from the factories."* [Paul Avrich,
**Kronstadt 1921**, p. 42] It seems equally strange that Harman
denounces the Stalinist suppression of the Hungarian revolution for
workers' democracy and genuine socialism while he defends the Bolshevik
suppression of the Kronstadt revolt for the same goals. Similarly, when
Harman argues that if by *"political party"* it is *"meant a party of
the usual sort, in which a few leaders give orders and the masses merely
obey . . . then certainly such organisations added nothing to the
Hungarian revolution."* However, as we discuss in [section
H.5](secH5.html), such a party was **precisely** what Leninism argued
for and applied in practice. Simply put, the Bolsheviks were never a
party *"that stood for the councils taking power."* [**Op. Cit.**, p.
186 and p. 187] As Lenin repeatedly stressed, its aim was for the
Bolshevik party to take power **through** the councils (see [section
H.3.11](secH3.html#sech311)). Once in power, the councils were quickly
marginalised and became little more than a fig-leaf for party rule.

This confusion between what was promised and what was done is a common
feature of Leninism. Felix Morrow, for example, wrote what is usually
considered the definitive Trotskyist work on the Spanish Revolution (in
spite of it being, as we discuss in the appendix *["Marxists and Spanish
Anarchism,"](append32.html)* deeply flawed). Morrow stated that the
*"essential points of a revolutionary program [are] all power to the
working class, and democratic organs of the workers, peasants and
combatants, as the expression of the workers' power."* [**Revolution and
Counter-Revolution in Spain**, p. 133] How this can be reconciled with,
say, Trotsky's opinion of ten years previously that *"[w]ith us the
dictatorship of the party (quite falsely disputed theoretically by
Stalin) is the expression of the socialist dictatorship of the
proletariat . . . The dictatorship of a party is a part of the socialist
revolution"*? [**Leon Trotsky on China**, p. 251] Or with Lenin's and
Trotsky's repeated call for the party to seize and exercise power? Or
their opinion that an organisation taking in the whole proletariat
cannot directly exercise the proletarian dictatorship? How can the
working class *"have all power"* if power is held not by mass
organisations but rather by a vanguard party? Particularly, as we note
in [section H.1.2](secH1.html#sech12) when party dictatorship is placed
at the heart of Leninist ideology.

Given all this, who is quoting who *"selectively"*? The Marxists who
ignore what the Bolsheviks did when in power and repeatedly point to
Lenin's **The State and Revolution** or the anarchists who link what
they did with what they said outside of that holy text? Considering this
absolutely contradictory inheritance, anarchists feel entitled to ask
the question *"Will the real Leninist please stand up?"* What is it to
be, popular democracy or party rule? If we look at Bolshevik practice,
the answer is the latter anarchists argue. Ironically, the likes of
Lenin and Trotsky concurred, incorporating the necessity of party power
into their ideology as a key lesson of the Russian revolution. As such,
anarchists do not feel they are quoting Leninism *"selectively"* when
they argue that it is based on party power, not working class
self-management. That Leninists often publicly deny this aspect of their
own ideology or, at best, try to rationalise and justify it, suggests
that when push comes to shove (as it does in every revolution) they will
make the same decisions and act in the same way.

In addition there is the question of what could be called the *"social
context."* Marxists often accuse anarchists of failing to place the
quotations and actions of, say, the Bolsheviks into the circumstances
which generated them. By this they mean that Bolshevik authoritarianism
can be explained purely in terms of the massive problems facing them
(i.e. the rigours of the Civil War, the economic collapse and chaos in
Russia and so on). As we discuss this question in [section
H.6](secH6.html), we will simply summarise the anarchist reply by noting
that this argument has three major problems with it. Firstly, there is
the problem that Bolshevik authoritarianism started **before** the start
of the Civil War and, moreover, intensified **after** its end. As such,
the Civil War cannot be blamed. The second problem is simply that Lenin
continually stressed that civil war and economic chaos was inevitable
during a revolution. If Leninist politics cannot handle the inevitable
then they are to be avoided. Equally, if Leninists blame what they
should **know** is inevitable for the degeneration of the Bolshevik
revolution it would suggest their understanding of what revolution
entails is deeply flawed. The last problem is simply that the Bolsheviks
did not care. As Samuel Farber notes, *"there is no evidence indicating
that Lenin or any of the mainstream Bolshevik leaders lamented the loss
of workers' control or of democracy in the soviets, or at least referred
to these losses as a retreat, as Lenin declared with the replacement of
War Communism by NEP in 1921. In fact . . . the very opposite is the
case."* [**Before Stalinism**, p. 44] Hence the continuation (indeed,
intensification) of Bolshevik authoritarianism after their victory in
the civil war. Given this, it is significant that many of the quotes
from Trotsky given above date from the late 1930s. To argue, therefore,
that "social context" explains the politics and actions of the
Bolsheviks seems incredulous.

Lastly, it seems ironic that Marxists accuse anarchists of quoting
*"selectively."* After all, as proven in [section H.2](secH2.html), this
is **exactly** what Marxists do to anarchism!

In summary, rather than quote *"selectively"* from the works and
practice of Marxism, anarchists summarise those tendencies of both
which, we argue, contribute to its continual failure in practice as a
revolutionary theory. Moreover, Marxists themselves are equally as
*"selective"* as anarchists in this respect. Firstly, as regards
anarchist theory and practice and, secondly, as regards their own.

H.3.5 Has Marxist appropriation of anarchist ideas changed it?
--------------------------------------------------------------

As is obvious in any account of the history of socialism, Marxists (of
various schools) have appropriated key anarchist ideas and (often)
present them as if Marxists thought of them first.

For example, as we discuss in [section H.3.10](secH3.html#sech310), it
was anarchists who first raised the idea of smashing the bourgeois state
and replacing it with the fighting organisations of the working class
(such as unions, workers' councils, etc.). It was only in 1917, decades
after anarchists had first raised the idea, that Marxists started to
argue these ideas but, of course, with a twist. While anarchists meant
that working class organisations would be the basis of a free society,
Lenin saw these organs as the best means of achieving Bolshevik party
power.

Similarly with the libertarian idea of the *"militant minority."* By
this, anarchists and syndicalists meant groups of workers who gave an
example by their direct action which their fellow workers could imitate
(for example by leading wildcat strikes which would use flying pickets
to get other workers to join in). This "militant minority" would be at
the forefront of social struggle and would show, by example, practice
and discussion, that their ideas and tactics were the correct ones.
After the Russian Revolution of 1917, Bolsheviks argued that this idea
was similar to their idea of a vanguard party. This ignored two key
differences. Firstly that the libertarian *"militant minority"* did not
aim to take power on behalf of the working class but rather to encourage
it, by example, to manage its own struggles and affairs (and,
ultimately, society). Secondly, that *"vanguard parties"* are organised
in hierarchical ways alien to the spirit of anarchism. While both the
*"militant minority"* and *"vanguard party"* approaches are based on an
appreciation of the uneven development of ideas within the working
class, vanguardism transforms this into a justification for party rule
**over** the working class by a so-called *"advanced"* minority (see
[section H.5](secH5.html) for a full discussion). Other concepts, such
as *"workers' control,"* direct action, and so on have suffered a
similar fate.

A classic example of this appropriation of anarchist ideas into Marxism
is provided by the general strike. In 1905, Russia had a near revolution
in which the general strike played a key role. Unsurprisingly, as
anarchists had been arguing for the general strike since the 1870s, we
embraced these events as a striking confirmation of our long held ideas
on revolutionary change. Marxists had a harder task as such ideas were
alien to mainstream Social Democracy. Yet faced with the success and
power of the general strike in practice, the more radical Marxists, like
Rosa Luxemburg, had to incorporate it into their politics.

Yet they faced a problem. The general strike was indelibly linked with
such hearsays as anarchism and syndicalism. Had not Engels himself
proclaimed the nonsense of the general strike in his diatribe *"The
Bakuninists at work"*? Had his words not been repeated ad infinitum
against anarchists (and radical socialists) who questioned the wisdom of
social democratic tactics, its reformism and bureaucratic inertia? The
Marxist radicals knew that Engels would again be invoked by the
bureaucrats and reformists in the Social Democratic movement to throw
cold water over any attempt to adjust Marxist politics to the economic
power of the masses as expressed in mass strikes. The Social Democratic
hierarchy would simply dismiss them as "anarchists." This meant that
Luxemburg was faced with the problem of proving Engels was right, even
when he was wrong.

She did so in an ingenious way. Like Engels himself, she simply
distorted what the anarchists thought about the general strike in order
to make it acceptable to Social Democracy. Her argument was simple. Yes,
Engels had been right to dismiss the "general strike" idea of the
anarchists in the 1870s. But today, thirty years later, Social Democrats
should support the general strike (or mass strike, as she called it)
because the concepts were different. The anarchist "general strike" was
utopian. The Marxist "mass strike" was practical.

To discover why, we need to see what Engels had argued in the 1870s.
Engels, mocked the anarchists (or "Bakuninists") for thinking that *"a
general strike is the lever employed by which the social revolution is
started."* He accusing them of imagining that *"[o]ne fine morning, all
the workers in all the industries of a country, or even of the whole
world, stop work, thus forcing the propertied classes either humbly to
submit within four weeks at most, or to attack the workers, who would
then have the right to defend themselves and use the opportunity to pull
down the entire old society."* He stated that at the September 1 1873
Geneva congress of the anarchist Alliance of Social Democracy, it was
*"universally admitted that to carry out the general strike strategy,
there had to be a perfect organisation of the working class and a
plentiful funds."* He noted that that was *"the rub"* as no government
would stand by and *"allow the organisation or funds of the workers to
reach such a level."* Moreover, the revolution would happen long before
*"such an ideal organisation"* was set up and if they had been *"there
would be no need to use the roundabout way of a general strike"* to
achieve it. [**Collected Works**, vol. 23, pp. 584-5]

Rosa Luxemburg repeated Engels arguments in her essay *"The Mass Strike,
the Political Party and the Trade Unions"* in order to show how her
support for the general strike was in no way contrary to Marxism.
[**Rosa Luxemburg Speaks**, pp. 153-218] Her "mass strike" was different
from the anarchist "general strike" as mocked by Engels as it was
dynamic process and could not be seen as one act, one isolated action
which overthrows the bourgeoisie. Rather, the mass strike to the product
of the everyday class struggle within society, leads to a direct
confrontation with the capitalist state and so it was inseparable from
the revolution.

The only problem with all this is that the anarchists did not actually
argue along the lines Engels and Luxemburg claimed. Most obviously, as
we indicated in [section H.2.8](secH2.html#sech28), Bakunin saw the
general strike as a **dynamic** process which would **not** be set for a
specific date and did **not** need all workers to be organised before
hand. As such, Bakunin's ideas are totally at odds with Engels
assertions on what anarchist ideas on the general strike were about
(they, in fact, reflect what actually happened in 1905).

But what of the "Bakuninists"? Again, Engels account leaves a lot to be
desired. Rather than the September 1873 Geneva congress being, as he
claimed, of the (disbanded) Alliance of Social Democracy, it was in fact
a meeting of the non-Marxist federations of the First International.
Contra Engels, anarchists did not see the general strike as requiring
all workers to be perfectly organised and then passively folding arms
*"one fine morning."* The Belgian libertarians who proposed the idea at
the congress saw it as a tactic which could mobilise workers for
revolution, *"a means of bringing a movement onto the street and leading
the workers to the barricades."* Moreover, leading anarchist James
Guillaume explicitly rejected the idea that it had *"to break out
everywhere at an appointed day and hour"* with a resounding *"No!"* In
fact, he stressed that they did *"not even need to bring up this
question and suppose things could be like this. Such a supposition could
lead to fatal mistakes. The revolution has to be contagious."* [quoted
by Caroline Cahm, **Kropotkin and the Rise of Revolutionary Anarchism
1872-1886**, p. 223 and p. 224]

Another account of this meeting notes that how the general strike was to
start was *"left unsaid"*, with Guillaume *"recognis[ing] that it as
impossible for the anarchists simply to set the hour for the general
strike."* Another anarchist did *"not believe that the strike was a
sufficient means to win the social revolution"* but could *"set the
stage for the success of an armed insurrection."* Only one delegate,
regardless of Engels' claims, thought it *"demanded the utmost
organisation of the working class"* and if that were the case *"then the
general strike would not be necessary."* This was the delegate from the
reformist British trade unions and he was *"attack[ing]"* the general
strike as *"an absurd and impractical proposition."* [Phil H. Goodstein,
**The Theory of the General Strike**, pp. 43-5]

Perhaps this is why Engels did not bother to quote a single anarchist
when recounting their position on this matter? Needless to say,
Leninists continue to parrot Engels assertions to this day. The facts
are somewhat different. Clearly, the "anarchist" strategy of
overthrowing the bourgeoisie with one big general strike set for a
specific date exists only in Marxist heads, nowhere else. Once we remove
the distortions promulgated by Engels and repeated by Luxemburg, we see
that the 1905 revolution and *"historical dialectics"* did not, as
Luxemburg claim, validate Engels and disprove anarchism. Quite the
reverse as the general strikes in Russia followed the anarchist ideas of
a what a general strike would be like quite closely. Little wonder,
then, that Kropotkin argued that the 1905 general strike
*"demonstrated"* that the Latin workers who had been advocating the
general strike *"as a weapon which would irresistible in the hands of
labour for imposing its will"* had been *"right.*" [**Selected Writings
on Anarchism and Revolution**, p. 288]

So, contra Luxemburg, *"the fatherland of Bakunin"* was **not** *"the
burial-place of [anarchism's] teachings."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 157] As
Nicholas Walter argued, while the numbers of actual anarchists was
small, *"the 1905 Revolution was objectively an anarchist revolution.
The military mutinies, peasant uprisings and workers' strikes
(culminating in a general strike), led to the establishment of soldiers'
and workers' councils . . . and peasants' communes, and the beginning of
agrarian and industrial expropriation - all along the lines suggested by
anarchist writers since Bakunin."* [**The Anarchist Past and Other
Essays**, p. 122] The real question must be when will Marxists realise
that quoting Engels does not make it true?

Moreover, without becoming an insurrection, as anarchists had stressed,
the limits of the general strike were exposed in 1905. Unlike the some
of the syndicalists in the 1890s and 1900s, this limitation was
understood by the earliest anarchists. Consequently, they saw the
general strike as the start of a revolution and not as the revolution
itself. So, for all the Leninist accounts of the 1905 revolution
claiming it for their ideology, the facts suggest that it was anarchism,
not Marxism, which was vindicated by it. Luxemburg was wrong. The *"land
of Bakunin's birth"* provided an unsurpassed example of how to make a
revolution precisely because it applied (and confirmed) anarchist ideas
on the general strike (and, it should be added, workers' councils).
Marxists (who had previously quoted Engels to dismiss such things) found
themselves repudiating aspect upon aspect of their dogma to remain
relevant. Luxemburg, as Bookchin noted, *"grossly misrepresented the
anarchist emphasis on the general strike after the 1905 revolution in
Russia in order to make it acceptable to Social Democracy."* (he added
that Lenin *"was to engage in the same misrepresentation on the issue of
popular control in **State and Revolution**"*). [**Towards an Ecological
Society**, p. 227fn]

As such, while Marxists have appropriated certain anarchist concepts, it
does not automatically mean that they mean exactly the same thing by
them. Rather, as history shows, radically different concepts can be
hidden behind similar sounding rhetoric. As Murray Bookchin argued, many
Marxist tendencies *"attach basically alien ideas to the withering
conceptual framework of Marxism - not to say anything new but to
preserve something old with ideological formaldehyde - to the detriment
of any intellectual growth that the distinctions are designed to foster.
This is mystification at its worst, for it not only corrupts ideas but
the very capacity of the mind to deal with them. If Marx's work can be
rescued for our time, it will be by dealing with it as an invaluable
part of the development of ideas, not as pastiche that is legitimated as
a 'method' or continually 'updated' by concepts that come from an alien
zone of ideas."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 242f]

This is not some academic point. The ramifications of Marxists
appropriating such *"alien ideas"* (or, more correctly, the rhetoric
associated with those ideas) has had negative impacts on actual
revolutionary movements. For example, Lenin's definition of *"workers'
control"* was radically different than that current in the factory
committee movement during the Russian Revolution (which had more in
common with anarchist and syndicalist use of the term). The similarities
in rhetoric allowed the factory committee movement to put its weight
behind the Bolsheviks. Once in power, Lenin's position was implemented
while that of the factory committees was ignored. Ultimately, Lenin's
position was a key factor in creating state capitalism rather than
socialism in Russia (see [section H.3.14](secH3.html#sech314) for more
details).

This, of course, does not stop modern day Leninists appropriating the
term workers' control *"without bating an eyelid. Seeking to capitalise
on the confusion now rampant in the movement, these people talk of
'workers' control' as if a) they meant by those words what the
politically unsophisticated mean (i.e. that working people should
themselves decide about the fundamental matters relating to production)
and b) as if they - and the Leninist doctrine to which they claim to
adhere - had always supported demands of this kind, or as if Leninism
had always seen in workers' control the universally valid foundation of
a new social order, rather than just a **slogan** to be used for
manipulatory purposes in specific and very limited historical
contexts."* [Maurice Brinton, **The Bolsheviks and Workers' Control**,
p. iv] This clash between the popular idea of workers' control and the
Leninist one was a key reason for the failure of the Russian Revolution
precisely because, once in power, the latter was imposed.

Thus the fact that Leninists have appropriated libertarian (and working
class) ideas and demands does not, in fact, mean that we aim for the
same thing (as we discussed in [section H.3.1](secH3.html#sech31), this
is far from the case). The use of anarchist/popular rhetoric and slogans
means little and we need to look at the content of the ideas proposed.
Given the legacy of the appropriation of libertarian terminology to
popularise authoritarian parties and its subsequent jettison in favour
of authoritarian policies once the party is in power, anarchists have
strong grounds to take Leninist claims with a large pinch of salt!

Equally with examples of actual revolutions. As Martin Buber noted,
while *"Lenin praises Marx for having 'not yet, in 1852, put the
concrete question as to what should be set up in place of the State
machinery after it had been abolished,'"* Lenin argued that *"it was
only the Paris Commune that taught Marx this."* However, as Buber
correctly pointed out, the Paris Commune *"was the realisation of the
thoughts of people who had put this question very concretely indeed . .
. the historical experience of the Commune became possible only because
in the hearts of passionate revolutionaries there lived the picture of a
decentralised, very much 'de-Stated' society, which picture they
undertook to translate into reality. The spiritual fathers of the
Commune had such that ideal aiming at decentralisation which Marx and
Engels did not have, and the leaders of the Revolution of 1871 tried,
albeit with inadequate powers, to begin the realisation of that idea in
the midst of revolution."* [**Paths in Utopia**, pp. 103-4] Thus, while
the Paris Commune and other working class revolts are praised, their
obvious anarchistic elements (which were usually often predicted by
anarchist thinkers) are not mentioned. This results in some strange
dichotomies. For example, Bakunin's vision of revolution is based on a
federation of workers' councils, predating Marxist support for such
bodies by decades, yet Marxists argue that Bakunin's ideas have nothing
to teach us. Or, the Paris Commune being praised by Marxists as the
first *"dictatorship of the proletariat"* when it implements federalism,
delegates being subjected to mandates and recall and raises the vision
of a socialism of associations while anarchism is labelled
"petit-bourgeois" in spite of the fact that these ideas can be found in
works of Proudhon and Bakunin which predate the 1871 revolt!

From this, we can draw two facts. Firstly, anarchism has successfully
predicted certain aspects of working class revolution. Anarchist K.J.
Kenafick stated the obvious when he argues that any *"comparison will
show that the programme set out [by the Paris Commune] is . . . the
system of Federalism, which Bakunin had been advocating for years, and
which had first been enunciated by Proudhon. The Proudhonists . . .
exercised considerable influence in the Commune. This 'political form'
was therefore not 'at last' discovered; it had been discovered years
ago; and now it was proven to be correct by the very fact that in the
crisis the Paris workers adopted it almost automatically, under the
pressure of circumstance, rather than as the result of theory, as being
the form most suitable to express working class aspirations."*
[**Michael Bakunin and Karl Marx**, pp. 212-3] Rather than being somehow
alien to the working class and its struggle for freedom, anarchism in
fact bases itself on the class struggle. This means that it should come
as no surprise when the ideas of anarchism are developed and applied by
those in struggle, for those ideas are just generalisations derived from
past working class struggles! If anarchism ideas are applied
spontaneously by those in struggle, it is because those involved are
themselves drawing similar conclusions from their own experiences.

The other fact is that while mainstream Marxism often appropriated
certain aspects of libertarian theory and practice, it does so
selectively and places them into an authoritarian context which
undermines their libertarian nature. Hence anarchist support for workers
councils becomes transformed by Leninists into a means to ensure party
power (i.e. state authority) rather than working class power or
self-management (i.e. no authority). Similarly, anarchist support for
leading by example becomes transformed into support for party rule (and
often dictatorship). Ultimately, the practice of mainstream Marxism
shows that libertarian ideas cannot be transplanted selectively into an
authoritarian ideology and be expected to blossom.

Significantly, those Marxists who **do** apply anarchist ideas honestly
are usually labelled by their orthodox comrades as *"anarchists."* As an
example of Marxists appropriating libertarian ideas honestly, we can
point to the council communist and currents within Autonomist Marxism.
The council communists broke with the Bolsheviks over the question of
whether the party would exercise power or whether the workers' councils
would. Needless to say, Lenin labelled them an *"anarchist deviation."*
Currents within Autonomist Marxism have built upon the council communist
tradition, stressing the importance of focusing analysis on working
class struggle as the key dynamic in capitalist society.

In this they go against the mainstream Marxist orthodoxy and embrace a
libertarian perspective. As libertarian socialist Cornelius Castoriadis
argued, *"the economic theory expounded [by Marx] in **Capital** is
based on the postulate that capitalism has managed completely and
effectively to transform the worker - who appears there only as labour
power - into a commodity; therefore the use value of labour power - the
use the capitalist makes of it - is, as for any commodity, completely
determined by the use, since its exchange value - wages - is determined
solely by the laws of the market . . . This postulate is necessary for
there to be a 'science of economics' along the physico-mathematical
model Marx followed . . . But he contradicts the most essential fact of
capitalism, namely, that the use value and exchange value of labour
power are objectively indeterminate; they are determined rather by the
struggle between labour and capital both in production and in society.
Here is the ultimate root of the 'objective' contradictions of
capitalism . . . The paradox is that Marx, the 'inventor' of class
struggle, wrote a monumental work on phenomena determined by this
struggle in which the struggle itself was entirely absent."*
[**Political and Social Writings**, vol. 2, pp. 202-3] Castoriadis
explained the limitations of Marx's vision most famously in his *"Modern
Capitalism and Revolution."* [**Op. Cit.**, pp. 226-343]

By rejecting this heritage which mainstream Marxism bases itself on and
stressing the role of class struggle, Autonomist Marxism breaks
decisively with the Marxist mainstream and embraces a position
previously associated with anarchists and other libertarian socialists.
The key role of class struggle in invalidating all deterministic
economic *"laws"* was expressed by French syndicalists at the start of
the twentieth century. This insight predated the work of Castoriadis and
the development of Autonomist Marxism by over 50 years and is worth
quoting at length:

> "the keystone of socialism . . . proclaimed that 'as a general rule,
> the average wage would be no more than what the worker strictly
> required for survival'. And it was said: 'That figure is governed by
> capitalist pressure alone and this can even push it below the minimum

And Marx, indeed, had compared the worker to a commodity, stating that
labour power *"is a commodity, neither more nor less than sugar. The
former is measured by the clock, the latter by the scale."* [**Selected
Works**, p. 72] However, as Castoridias argued, unlike sugar the
extraction of the use value of labour power *"is not a technical
operation; it is a process of bitter struggle in which half the time, so
to speak, the capitalists turn out to be losers."* [**Op. Cit.**, p.
248] A fact which Pouget stressed in his critique of the mainstream
socialist position:

> "A novel factor has appeared on the labour market: the will of the
> worker! And this factor, not pertinent when it comes to setting the
> price of a bushel of potatoes, has a bearing upon the setting of
> wages; its impact may be large or small, according to the degree of

> weak, there is no denying it.
> "Thus, worker cohesion conjures up against capitalist might a might

> proletarian resistance, be it latent or acute, is an everyday
> phenomenon: disputes between labour and capital quicken and become
> more acute. Labour does not always emerge victorious from these
> partial struggles: however, even when defeated, the struggle workers
> still reap some benefit: resistance from them has obstructed pressure
> from the employers and often forced the employer to grant some of the
> demands put." [**Op. Cit.**, p. 10]

The best currents of Autonomist Marxism share this anarchist stress on
the power of working people to transform society and to impact on how
capitalism operates. Unsurprisingly, most Autonomist Marxists reject the
idea of the vanguard party and instead, like the council communists,
stress the need for **autonomist** working class self-organisation and
self-activity (hence the name!). They agree with Pouget when he argued
that direct action *"spells liberation for the masses of humanity"*, it
*"puts paid to the age of miracles - miracles from Heaven, miracles from
the State - and, in contraposition to hopes vested in 'providence' (no
matter what they may be) it announces that it will act upon the maxim:
salvation lies within ourselves!"* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 3] As such, they
draw upon anarchistic ideas and rhetoric (for many, undoubtedly
unknowingly) and draw anarchistic conclusions. This can be seen from the
works of the leading US Autonomist Marxist Harry Cleaver. His excellent
essay *"Kropotkin, Self-Valorisation and the Crisis of Marxism"* is by
far the best Marxist account of Kropotkin's ideas and shows the
similarities between communist-anarchism and Autonomist Marxism.
[**Anarchist Studies**, vol.2 , no. 2, pp. 119-36] Both, he points out,
share a *"common perception and sympathy for the power of workers to act
autonomously"* regardless of the *"substantial differences"* on other
issues. [**Reading Capital Politically**, p. 15]

As such, the links between the best Marxists and anarchism can be
substantial. This means that some Marxists have taken on board many
anarchist ideas and have forged a version of Marxism which is basically
libertarian in nature. Unfortunately, such forms of Marxism have always
been a minority current within it. Most cases have seen the
appropriation of anarchist ideas by Marxists simply as part of an
attempt to make mainstream, authoritarian Marxism more appealing and
such borrowings have been quickly forgotten once power has been seized.

Therefore appropriation of rhetoric and labels should not be confused
with similarity of goals and ideas. The list of groupings which have
used inappropriate labels to associate their ideas with other, more
appealing, ones is lengthy. Content is what counts. If libertarian
sounding ideas **are** being raised, the question becomes one of whether
they are being used simply to gain influence or whether they signify a
change of heart. As Bookchin argued:

> *"Ultimately, a line will have to be drawn that, by definition,
> excludes any project that can tip decentralisation to the side of
> centralisation, direct democracy to the side of delegated power,
> libertarian institutions to the side of bureaucracy, and spontaneity
> to the side of authority. Such a line, like a physical barrier, must
> irrevocably separate a libertarian zone of theory and practice from
> the hybridised socialisms that tend to denature it. This zone must
> build its anti-authoritarian, utopian, and revolutionary commitments
> into the very recognition it has of itself, in short, into the very
> way it defines itself. . . . to admit of domination is to cross the
> line that separates the libertarian zone from the [state] socialist."*
> [**Op. Cit.**, pp. 223-4]

Unless we know exactly what we aim for, how to get there and who our
**real** allies are we will get a nasty surprise once our
self-proclaimed "allies" take power. As such, any attempt to appropriate
anarchist rhetoric into an authoritarian ideology will simply fail and
become little more than a mask obscuring the real aims of the party in
question. As history shows.

H.3.6 Is Marxism the only revolutionary politics which have worked?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Some Marxists will dismiss our arguments, and anarchism, out of hand.
This is because anarchism has not lead a "successful" revolution while
Marxism has. The fact, they assert, that there has never been a serious
anarchist revolutionary movement, let alone a successful anarchist
revolution, in the whole of history proves that Marxism works. For some
Marxists, practice determines validity. Whether something is true or not
is not decided intellectually in wordy publications and debates, but in
reality.

For Anarchists, such arguments simply show the ideological nature of
most forms of Marxism. The fact is, of course, that there has been many
anarchistic revolutions which, while ultimately defeated, show the
validity of anarchist theory (the ones in Spain and in the Ukraine being
the most significant). Moreover, there have been serious revolutionary
anarchist movements across the world, the majority of them crushed by
state repression (usually fascist or communist based). However, this is
not the most important issue, which is the fate of these "successful"
Marxist movements and revolutions. The fact that there has never been a
"Marxist" revolution which has not become a party dictatorship proves
the need to critique Marxism.

So, given that Marxists argue that Marxism is **the** revolutionary
working class political theory, its actual track record has been
appalling. After all, while many Marxist parties have taken part in
revolutions and even seized power, the net effect of their "success"
have been societies bearing little or no relationship to socialism.
Rather, the net effect of these revolutions has been to discredit
socialism by associating it with one-party states presiding over state
capitalist economies.

Equally, the role of Marxism in the labour movement has also been less
than successful. Looking at the first Marxist movement, social
democracy, it ended by becoming reformist, betraying socialist ideas by
(almost always) supporting their own state during the First World War
and going so far as crushing the German revolution and betraying the
Italian factory occupations in 1920. Indeed, Trotsky stated that the
Bolshevik party was *"the only revolutionary"* section of the Second
International, which is a damning indictment of Marxism. [**Stalin**,
vol. 1, p. 248] Just as damning is the fact that neither Lenin or
Trotsky noticed it before 1914! In fact, Lenin praised the
*"fundamentals of parliamentary tactics"* of German and International
Social Democracy, expressing the opinion that they were *"at the same
time implacable on questions of principle and always directed to the
accomplishment of the final aim"* in his obituary of August Bebel in
1913! [**Collected Works**, vol. 19, p. 298] For those that way
inclined, some amusement can be gathered comparing Engels glowing
predictions for these parties and their actual performance (in the case
of Spain and Italy, his comments seem particularly ironic).

As regards Bolshevism itself, the one "revolutionary" party in the
world, it avoided the fate of its sister parties simply because there no
question of applying social democratic tactics within bourgeois
institutions as these did not exist in Tsarist Russia. Moreover, the net
result of its seizure of power was, first, a party dictatorship and
state capitalism under Lenin, then their intensification under Stalin
and the creation of a host of Trotskyist sects who spend a considerable
amount of time justifying and rationalising the ideology and actions of
the Bolsheviks which helped create the Stalinism. Given the fate of
Bolshevism in power, Bookchin simply stated the obviously:

> *"None of the authoritarian technics of change has provided successful
> 'paradigms', unless we are prepared to ignore the harsh fact that the
> Russian, Chinese, and Cuban 'revolutions' were massive
> counterrevolutions that blight our entire century."* [**The Ecology of
> Freedom**, p. 446]

Clearly, a key myth of Marxism is the idea that it has been a successful
movement. In reality, its failures have been consistent and devastating
so suggesting it is time to re-evaluate the whole ideology and embrace a
revolutionary theory like anarchism. Indeed, it would be no exaggeration
to argue that every *"success"* of Marxism has, in fact, proved that the
anarchist critique of Marxism was correct. Thus, as Bakunin predicted,
the Social-Democratic parties became reformist and the *"dictatorship of
the proletariat"* became the *"dictatorship **over** the proletariat."*
With "victories" like these, Marxism does not need failures! Thus Murray
Bookchin:

> *"A theory which is so readily 'vulgarised,' 'betrayed,' or, more
> sinisterly, institutionalised into bureaucratic power by nearly all
> its adherents may well be one that lends itself to such
> 'vulgarisations,' 'betrayals,' and bureaucratic forms **as a normal
> condition of its existence.** What may seem to be 'vulgarisations,
> 'betrayals,' and bureaucratic manifestations of its tenets in the
> heated light of doctrinal disputes may prove to be the fulfilment of
> its tenets in the cold light of historical development."* [**Toward an
> Ecological Society**, p. 196]

Hence the overwhelming need to critically evaluate Marxist ideas and
history (such as the Russian Revolution - see [section
H.6](secH6.html)). Unless we honestly discuss and evaluate all aspects
of revolutionary ideas, we will never be able to build a positive and
constructive revolutionary movement. By seeking the roots of Marxism's
problems, we can enrich anarchism by avoiding possible pitfalls and
recognising and building upon its strengths (e.g., where anarchists have
identified, however incompletely, problems in Marxism which bear on
revolutionary ideas, practice and transformation).

If this is done, anarchists are sure that Marxist claims that Marxism is
**the** revolutionary theory will be exposed for the baseless rhetoric
they are.

H.3.7 What is wrong with the Marxist theory of the state?
---------------------------------------------------------

For anarchists, the idea that a state (any state) can be used for
socialist ends is simply ridiculous. This is because of the nature of
the state as an instrument of minority class rule. As such, it precludes
the mass participation required for socialism and would create a new
form of class society.

As we discussed in [section B.2](secB2.html), the state is defined by
certain characteristics (most importantly, the centralisation of power
into the hands of a few). Thus, for anarchists, *"the word 'State' . . .
should be reserved for those societies with the hierarchical system and
centralisation."* [Peter Kropotkin, **Ethics**, p. 317f] This defining
feature of the state has not come about by chance. As Kropotkin argued
in his classic history of the state, *"a social institution cannot lend
itself to **all** the desired goals, since, as with every organ, [the
state] developed according to the function it performed, in a definite
direction and not in all possible directions."* This means, by *"seeing
the State as it has been in history, and as it is in essence today"* the
conclusion anarchists *"arrive at is for the abolition of the State."*
Thus the state has *"developed in the history of human societies to
prevent the direct association among men [and women] to shackle the
development of local and individual initiative, to crush existing
liberties, to prevent their new blossoming - all this in order to
subject the masses to the will of minorities."* [**The State: Its
Historic Role**, p. 56]

So if the state, as Kropotkin stressed, is defined by *"the existence of
a power situated above society, but also of a **territorial
concentration** as well as the concentration **in the hands of a few of
many functions in the life of societies**"* then such a structure has
not evolved by chance. Therefore *"the pyramidal organisation which is
the essence of the State"* simply *"cannot lend itself to a function
opposed to the one for which it was developed in the course of
history,"* such as the popular participation from below required by
social revolution and socialism. [**Op. Cit.**, p. 10, p. 59 and p. 56]
Based on this evolutionary analysis of the state, Kropotkin, like all
anarchists, drew the conclusion *"that the State organisation, having
been the force to which the minorities resorted for establishing and
organising their power over the masses, cannot be the force which will
serve to destroy these privileges."* [**Evolution and Environment**, p.
82]

This does **not** mean that anarchists dismiss differences between types
of state, think the state has not changed over time or refuse to see
that different states exist to defend different ruling minorities. Far
from it. Anarchists argue that *"[e]very economic phase has a political
phase corresponding to it, and it would be impossible to touch private
property unless a new mode of political life be found at the same
time."* *"A society founded on serfdom,"* Kropotkin explained, *"is in
keeping with absolute monarchy; a society based on the wage system, and
the exploitation of the masses by the capitalists finds it political
expression in parliamentarianism."* As such, the state form changes and
evolves, but its basic function (defender of minority rule) and
structure (delegated power into the hands of a few) remains. Which means
that *"a free society regaining possession of the common inheritance
must seek, in free groups and free federations of groups, a new
organisation, in harmony with the new economic phase of history."*
[**The Conquest of Bread**, p. 54]

As with any social structure, the state has evolved to ensure that it
carries out its function. In other words, the state is centralised
because it is an instrument of minority domination and oppression.
Insofar as a social system is based on decentralisation of power,
popular self-management, mass participation and free federation from
below upwards, it is not a state. If a social system is, however, marked
by delegated power and centralisation it is a state and cannot be,
therefore, a instrument of social liberation. Rather it will become,
slowly but surely, *"whatever title it adopts and whatever its origin
and organisation may be"* what the state has always been, a instrument
for *"oppressing and exploiting the masses, of defending the oppressors
and the exploiters."* [Malatesta, **Anarchy**, p. 23] Which, for obvious
reasons, is why anarchists argue for the destruction of the state by a
free federation of self-managed communes and workers' councils (see
[section H.1.4](secH1.html#sech14) for further discussion).

This explains why anarchists reject the Marxist definition and theory of
the state. For Marxists, *"the state is nothing but a machine for the
oppression of one class by another."* While it has been true that,
historically, it is *"the state of the most powerful, economically
dominant class, which, through the medium of the state, becomes also the
politically dominant class, and this acquires the means of holding down
and exploiting the oppressed class,"* this need not always be the case.
The state is *"at best an evil inherited by the proletariat after its
victorious struggle for class supremacy,"* although it *"cannot avoid
having to lop off at once as much as possible"* of it *"until such time
as a generation reared in new, free social conditions is able to throw
the entire lumber of the state on the scrap heap."* This new state,
often called the *"dictatorship of the proletariat,"* would slowly
*"wither away"* (or *"dies out"*) as classes disappear and the state
*"at last . . . becomes the real representative of the whole of
society"* and so *"renders itself unnecessary."* Engels is at pains to
differentiate this position from that of the anarchists, who demand
*"the abolition of the state out of hand."* [**Selected Works**, p. 258,
pp. 577-8, p. 528 and p. 424]

For anarchists, this argument has deep flaws. Simply put, unlike the
anarchist one, this is not an empirically based theory of the state.
Rather, we find such a theory mixed up with a metaphysical,
non-empirical, a-historic definition which is based not on what the
state **is** but rather what it **could** be. Thus the argument that the
state *"is nothing but a machine for the oppression of one class by
another"* is trying to draw out an abstract essence of the state rather
than ground what the state is on empirical evidence and analysis. This
perspective, anarchists argue, simply confuses two very different
things, namely the state and popular social organisation, with
potentially disastrous results. By calling the popular self-organisation
required by a social revolution the same name as a hierarchical and
centralised body constructed for, and evolved to ensure, minority rule,
the door is wide open to confuse popular power with party power, to
confuse rule by the representatives of the working class with working
class self-management of the revolution and society.

Indeed, at times, Marx seemed to suggest that **any** form of social
organisation is a state. At one point he complained that the French
mutualists argued that *"[e]verything [was] to broken down into small
'**groupes**' or '**communes**', which in turn form an 'association',
but not a state."* [**Collected Works**, vol. 42, p. 287]
Unsurprisingly, then, that Kropotkin noted *"the German school which
takes pleasure in confusing **State** with **Society**."* This was a
*"confusion"* made by those *"who cannot visualise Society without a
concentration of the State."* Yet this *"is to overlook the fact that
Man lived in Societies for thousands of years before the State had been
heard of"* and that *"communal life"* had *"been destroyed by the
State."* So *"large numbers of people [have] lived in communes and free
federations"* and these were not states as the state *"is only one of
the forms assumed by society in the course of history. Why then make no
distinction between what is permanent and what is accidental?"* [**The
State: Its Historic Role**, pp. 9-10]

As we discussed in [section H.2.1](secH2.html#sech21), anarchist
opposition to the idea of a "dictatorship of the proletariat" should not
be confused with idea that anarchists do not think that a social
revolution needs to be defended. Rather, our opposition to the concept
rests on the confusion which inevitably occurs when you mix up
scientific analysis with metaphysical concepts. By drawing out an
a-historic definition of the state, Engels helped ensure that the
*"dictatorship of the proletariat"* became the *"dictatorship over the
proletariat"* by implying that centralisation and delegated power into
the hands of the few can be considered as an expression of popular
power.

To explain why, we need only to study the works of Engels himself.
Engels, in his famous account of the **Origin of the Family, Private
Property and the State**, defined the state as follows:

> *"The state is . . . by no means a power forced on society from
> without . . . Rather, it is a product of society at a certain stage of
> development; it is an admission . . . that it has split into
> irreconcilable antagonisms . . . in order that these antagonisms and
> classes with conflicting economic interests might not consume
> themselves and society in fruitless struggle, it became necessary to
> have power seemingly standing above society that would alleviate the
> conflict . . . this power, arisen out of society but placing itself
> above it, and alienating itself more and more from it, is the state."*
> [**Selected Writings**, p. 576]

The state has two distinguishing features, firstly (and least
importantly) it *"divides its subjects **according to territory.**"* The
second *"is the establishment of a **public power** which no longer
directly coincides with the population organising itself as an armed
force. This special public power is necessary because a self-acting
armed organisation of the population has become impossible since the
split into classes . . . This public power exists in every state; it
consists not merely of armed men but also of material adjuncts, prisons
and institutions of coercion of all kinds."* Thus *"an essential feature
of the state is a public power distinct from the mass of the people."*
[**Op. Cit.**, pp. 576-7 and pp. 535-6]

In this, the Marxist position concurs with the anarchist. Engels
discussed the development of numerous ancient societies to prove his
point. Talking of Greek society, he argued that it was based on a
popular assembly which was *"sovereign"* plus a council. This social
system was not a state because *"when every adult male member of the
tribe was a warrior, there was as yet no public authority separated from
the people that could have been set up against it. Primitive democracy
was still in full bloom, and this must remain the point of departure in
judging power and the status of the council."* Discussing the descent of
this society into classes, he argued that this required *"an institution
that would perpetuate, not only the newly-rising class division of
society, but the right of the possessing class to exploit the
non-possessing class and the rule of the former over the latter."*
Unsurprisingly, *"this institution arrived. The **state** was
invented."* The original communal organs of society were *"superseded by
real governmental authorities"* and the defence of society (*"the actual
'people in arms'"*) was *"taken by an armed 'public power' at the
service of these authorities and, therefore, also available against the
people."* With the rise of the state, the communal council was
*"transformed into a senate."* [**Op. Cit.**, pp. 525-6, p. 528 and p.
525]

Thus the state arises specifically to exclude popular self-government,
replacing it with minority rule conducted via a centralised,
hierarchical top-down structure (*"government . . . is the natural
protector of capitalism and other exploiters of popular labour."*
[Bakunin, **Michael Bakunin: Selected Writings**, p. 239]).

This account of the rise of the state is at direct odds with Engels
argument that the state is simply an instrument of class rule. For the
*"dictatorship of the proletariat"* to be a state, it would have to
constitute a power above society, be different from the people armed,
and so be *"a public power distinct from the mass of the people."*
However, Marx and Engels are at pains to stress that the *"dictatorship
of the proletariat"* will not be such a regime. However, how can you
have something (namely *"a public power distinct from the mass of the
people"*) you consider as *"an essential feature"* of a state missing in
an institution you call the same name? It is a bit like calling a mammal
a *"new kind of reptile"* in spite of the former not being cold-blooded,
something you consider as *"an essential feature"* of the latter!

This contradiction helps explains Engels comments that *"[w]e would
therefore propose to replace **state** everywhere by **Gemeinwesen,** a
good old German word which can very well convey the meaning of the
French word '**commune'**"* He even states that the Paris Commune *"was
no longer a state in the proper sense of the word."* However, this
comment does not mean that Engels sought to remove any possible
confusion on the matter, for he still talked of *"the state"* as *"only
a transitional institution which is used in the struggle, in the
revolution, to hold down's one's adversaries by force . . . so long as
the proletariat still **uses** the state, it does not use it the
interests of freedom but in order to hold down its adversaries, and as
soon as it becomes possible to speak of freedom the state as such ceases
to exist."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 335] Thus the state would still exist and,
furthermore, is **not** identified with the working class as a whole
(*"a self-acting armed organisation of the population"*), rather it is
an institution standing apart from the *"people armed"* which is used,
by the proletariat, to crush its enemies.

(As an aside, we must stress that to state that it only becomes possible
to *"speak of freedom"* after the state and classes cease to exist is a
serious theoretical error. Firstly, it means to talk about *"freedom"*
in the abstract, ignoring the reality of class and hierarchical society.
To state the obvious, in class society working class people have their
freedom restricted by the state, wage labour and other forms of social
hierarchy. The aim of social revolution is the conquest of liberty by
the working class by overthrowing hierarchical rule. Freedom for the
working class, by definition, means stopping any attempts to restrict
that freedom by its adversaries. To state the obvious, it is not a
*"restriction"* of the freedom of would-be bosses to resist their
attempts to impose their rule! As such, Engels failed to consider
revolution from a working class perspective - see [section
H.4.7](secH4.html#sech47) for another example of this flaw. Moreover his
comments have been used to justify restrictions on working class
freedom, power and political rights by Marxist parties once they have
seized power. *"Whatever power the State gains,"* correctly argued
Bookchin, *"it always does so at the expense of popular power.
Conversely, whatever power the people gain, they always acquire at the
expense of the State. To legitimate State power, in effect, is to
delegitimate popular power."* [**Remaking Society**, p. 160])

Elsewhere, we have Engels arguing that *"the characteristic attribute of
the former state"* is that while society *"had created its own organs to
look after its own special interests"* in the course of time *"these
organs, at whose head was the state power, transformed themselves from
the servants of society into the masters of society."* [**Op. Cit.**, p.
257] Ignoring the obvious contradiction with his earlier claims that the
state and communal organs were different, with the former destroying the
latter, we are struck yet again by the idea of the state as being
defined as an institution above society. Thus, if the post revolutionary
society is marked by *"the state"* being dissolved into society, placed
under its control, then it is not a state. To call it a *"new and truly
democratic"* form of *"state power"* makes as little sense as calling a
motorcar a *"new"* form of bicycle. As such, when Engels argues that the
Paris Commune *"was no longer a state in the proper sense of the word"*
or that when the proletariat seizes political power it *"abolishes the
state as state"* we may be entitled to ask what it is, a state or not a
state. [**Op. Cit.**, p. 335 and p. 424] It cannot be both, it cannot be
a *"public power distinct from the mass of the people"* **and** *"a
self-acting armed organisation of the population."* If it is the latter,
then it does not have what Engels considered as *"an essential feature
of the state"* and cannot be considered one. If it is the former, then
any claim that such a regime is the rule of the working class is
automatically invalidated. That Engels mocked the anarchists for seeking
a revolution *"without a provisional government and in the total absence
of any state or state-like institution, which are to be destroyed"* we
can safely say that it is the former. [Marx, Engels and Lenin,
**Anarchism and Anarcho-Syndicalism**, p. 156]

Given that *"primitive democracy,"* as Engels noted, defended itself
against its adversaries without such an institution shows that to equate
the defence of working class freedom with the state is not only
unnecessary, it simply leads to confusion. For this reason anarchists do
not confuse the necessary task of defending and organising a social
revolution with creating a state. Thus, the problem for Marxism is that
the empirical definition of the state collides with the metaphysical,
the actual state with its Marxist essence. As Italian Anarchist Camillo
Berneri argued: *"'The Proletariat' which seizes the state, bestowing on
it the complete ownership of the means of production and destroying
itself as proletariat and the state 'as the state' is a metaphysical
fantasy, a political hypostasis of social abstractions."* [*"The
Abolition and Extinction of the State,"* pp. 50-1, **Cienfuegos Press
Anarchist Review**, no. 4, p. 50]

This is no academic point, as we explain in the [next
section](secH3.html#sech38) this confusion has been exploited to justify
party power **over** the proletariat. Thus, as Berneri argued, Marxists
*"do not propose the armed conquest of the commune by the whole
proletariat, but they propose the conquest of the State by the party
which imagines it represents the proletariat. The Anarchists allow the
use of direct power by the proletariat, but they understand the organ of
this power to be formed by the entire corpus of systems of communist
administration - corporate organisations [i.e. industrial unions],
communal institutions, both regional and national - freely constituted
outside and in opposition to all political monopoly by parties and
endeavouring to a minimum administrational centralisation."* Thus *"the
Anarchists desire the destruction of the classes by means of a social
revolution which eliminates, with the classes, the State."*
[*"Dictatorship of the Proletariat and State Socialism"*, pp 51-2, **Op.
Cit.**, p. 52] Anarchists are opposed to the state because it is not
neutral, it cannot be made to serve our interests. The structures of the
state are only necessary when a minority seeks to rule over the
majority. We argue that the working class can create our own structures,
organised and run from below upwards, to ensure the efficient running of
everyday life.

By confusing two radically different things, Marxism ensures that
popular power is consumed and destroyed by the state, by a new ruling
elite. In the words of Murray Bookchin:

> *"Marx, in his analysis of the Paris Commune of 1871, has done radical
> social theory a considerable disservice. The Commune's combination of
> delegated policy-making with the execution of policy by its own
> administrators, a feature of the Commune which Marx celebrated, is a
> major failing of that body. Rousseau quite rightly emphasised that
> popular power cannot be delegated without being destroyed. One either
> has a fully empowered popular assembly or power belongs to the
> State."* [*"Theses on Libertarian Municipalism"*, pp. 9-22, **The
> Anarchist Papers**, Dimitrios Roussopoulos (ed.), p. 14]

If power belongs to the state, then the state is a public body distinct
from the population and, therefore, not an instrument of working class
power. Rather, as an institution designed to ensure minority rule, it
would ensure its position within society and become either the ruling
class itself or create a new class which instrument it would be. As we
discuss in [section H.3.9](secH3.html#sech39) the state cannot be
considered as a neutral instrument of economic class rule, it has
specific interests in itself which can and does mean it can play an
oppressive and exploitative role in society independently of an
economically dominant class.

Which brings us to the crux of the issue whether this "new" state will,
in fact, be unlike any other state that has ever existed. Insofar as
this "new" state is based on popular self-management and
self-organisation, anarchists argue that such an organisation cannot be
called a state as it is **not** based on delegated power. *"As long
as,"* as Bookchin stressed, *"the institutions of power consisted of
armed workers and peasants as distinguished from a professional
bureaucracy, police force, army, and cabal of politicians and judges,
they were no[t] a State . . . These institutions, in fact comprised a
revolutionary people in arms . . . not a professional apparatus that
could be regarded as a State in any meaningful sense of the term."*
[*"Looking Back at Spain,"* pp. 53-96, **The Radical Papers**, Dimitrios
I. Roussopoulos (ed.), p. 86] This was why Bakunin was at pains to
emphasis that a *"federal organisation, from below upward, of workers'
associations, groups, communes, districts, and ultimately, regions and
nations"* could not be considered as the same as *"centralised states"*
and were *"contrary to their essence."* [**Statism and Anarchy**, p. 13]

So when Lenin argued in **State and Revolution** that in the
*"dictatorship of the proletariat"* the *"organ of suppression is now
the majority of the population, and not the minority"* and that *"since
the majority of the people **itself** suppresses its oppressors, a
'special force' for the suppression [of the bourgeoisie] is **no longer
necessary**"* he is confusing two fundamentally different things. As
Engels made clear, such a social system of *"primitive democracy"* is
not a state. However, when Lenin argued that *"the more the functions of
state power devolve upon the people generally, the less need is there
for the existence of this power,"* he was implicitly arguing that there
would be, in fact, a *"public power distinct from mass of the people"*
and so a state in the normal sense of the word based on delegated power,
*"special forces"* separate from the armed people and so on.
[**Essential Works of Lenin**, p. 301]

That such a regime would not *"wither away"* has been proven by history.
The state machine does not (indeed, **cannot**) represent the interests
of the working classes due to its centralised, hierarchical and elitist
nature - all it can do is represent the interests of the party in power,
its own bureaucratic needs and privileges and slowly, but surely, remove
itself from popular control. This, as anarchists have constantly
stressed, is why the state is based on the delegation of power, on
hierarchy and centralisation. The state is organised in this way to
facilitate minority rule by excluding the mass of people from taking
part in the decision making processes within society. If the masses
actually did manage society directly, it would be impossible for a
minority class to dominate it. Hence the need for a state. Which shows
the central fallacy of the Marxist theory of the state, namely it argues
that the rule of the proletariat will be conducted by a structure, the
state, which is designed to exclude the popular participation such a
concept demands!

Considered another way, *"political power"* (the state) is simply the
power of minorities to enforce their wills. This means that a social
revolution which aims to create socialism cannot use it to further its
aims. After all, if the state (i.e. *"political power"*) has been
created to further minority class rule (as Marxists and anarchists
agree) then, surely, this function has determined how the organ which
exercises it has developed. Therefore, we would expect organ and
function to be related and impossible to separate. So when Marx argued
that the conquest of political power had become the great duty of the
working class because landlords and capitalists always make use of their
political privileges to defend their economic monopolies and enslave
labour, he drew the wrong conclusion.

Building on a historically based (and so evolutionary) understanding of
the state, anarchists concluded that it was necessary not to seize
political power (which could only be exercised by a minority within any
state) but rather to destroy it, to dissipate power into the hands of
the working class, the majority. By ending the regime of the powerful by
destroying their instrument of rule, the power which was concentrated
into their hands automatically falls back into the hands of society.
Thus, working class power can only be concrete once *"political power"*
is shattered and replaced by the social power of the working class based
on its own class organisations (such as factory committees, workers'
councils, unions, neighbourhood assemblies and so on). As Murray
Bookchin put it:

> *"the slogan 'Power to the people' can only be put into practice when
> the power exercised by social elites is dissolved into the people.
> Each individual can then take control of his [or her] daily life. If
> 'Power to the people' means nothing more than power to the 'leaders'
> of the people, then the people remain an undifferentiated, manipulated
> mass, as powerless after the revolution as they were before."*
> [**Post-Scarcity Anarchism**, p. xif]

In practice, this means that any valid social revolution needs to break
the state and **not** replace it with another one. This is because, in
order to be a state, any state structure must be based on delegated
power, hierarchy and centralisation (*"every State, even the most
Republican and the most democratic . . . . are in essence only machines
governing the masses from above"* and *"[i]f there is a State, there
must necessarily be domination, and therefore slavery; a State without
slavery, overt or concealed, is unthinkable - and that is why we are
enemies of the State."* [Bakunin, **The Political Philosophy of
Bakunin**, p. 211 and p. 287]). If power is devolved to the working
class then the state no longer exists as its *"essential feature"* (of
delegated power) is absent. What you have is a new form of the
*"primitive democracy"* which existed before the rise of the state.
While this new, modern, form of self-management will have to defend
itself against those seeking to recreate minority power, this does not
mean that it becomes a state. After all, the tribes with *"primitive
democracy"* had to defend themselves against their adversaries and so
that, in itself, does not means that these communities had a state (see
[section H.2.1](secH2.html#sech21)). Thus defence of a revolution, as
anarchists have constantly stressed, does not equate to a state as it
fails to address the key issue, namely who has **power** in the system -
the masses or their leaders.

This issue is fudged by Marx. When Bakunin, in *"Statism and Anarchy"*,
asked the question *"Will the entire proletariat head the government?"*,
Marx argued in response:

> *"Does in a trade union, for instance, the whole union constitute the
> executive committee? Will all division of labour in a factory
> disappear and also the various functions arising from it? And will
> everybody be at the top in Bakunin's construction built from the
> bottom upwards? There will in fact be no below then. Will all members

As Alan Carter argues, *"this might have seemed to Marx [over] a century
ago to be satisfactory rejoinder, but it can hardly do today. In the
infancy of the trade unions, which is all Marx knew, the possibility of
the executives of a trade union becoming divorced from the ordinary
members may not have seemed to him to be a likely outcome, We, however,
have behind us a long history of union leaders 'selling out' and being
out of touch with their members. Time has ably demonstrated that to
reject Bakunin's fears on the basis of the practice of trade union
officials constitutes a woeful complacency with regard to power and
privilege - a complacency that was born ample fruit in the form of
present Marxist parties and 'communist' societies . . . [His] dispute
with Bakunin shows quite clearly that Marx did not stress the continued
control of the revolution by the mass of the people as a prerequisite
for the transcendence of all significant social antagonisms."* [**Marx:
A Radical Critique**, pp. 217-8] Non-anarchists have also noticed the
poverty of Marx's response. For example, as David W. Lovell puts it,
*"[t]aken as a whole, Marx's comments have dodged the issue. Bakunin is
clearly grappling with the problems of Marx's transition period, in
particular the problem of leadership, while Marx refuses to discuss the
political form of what must be (at least in part) class rule by the
proletariat."* [**From Marx to Lenin**, p. 64]

As we discussed in [section H.3.1](secH3.html#sech31), Marx's *"Address
to the Communist League,"* with its stress on *"the most determined
centralisation of power in the hands of the state authority"* and that
*"the path of revolutionary activity . . . can only proceed with full
force from the centre,"* suggests that Bakunin's fears were valid and
Marx's answer simply inadequate. [**Marx-Engels Reader**, p. 509] Simply
put, if, as Engels argued, *"an essential feature of the state is a
public power distinct from the mass of the people,"* then, clearly
Marx's argument of 1850 (and others like it) signifies a state in the
usual sense of the word, one which has to be *"distinct"* from the mass
of the population in order to ensure that the masses are prevented from
interfering with their own revolution. This was not, of course, the
desire of Marx and Engels but this result flows from their theory of the
state and its fundamental flaws. These flaws can be best seen from their
repeated assertion that the capitalist democratic state could be
captured via universal suffrage and used to introduce socialism (see
[section H.3.10](secH3.html#sech310)) but it equally applies to notions
of creating new states based on the centralisation of power favoured by
ruling elites since class society began.

As Kropotkin stressed, *"one does not make an historical institution
follow in the direction to which one points - that is in the opposite
direction to the one it has taken over the centuries."* To expect this
would be a *"a sad and tragic mistake"* simply because *"the old
machine, the old organisation, [was] slowly developed in the course of
history to crush freedom, to crush the individual, to establish
oppression on a legal basis, to create monopolists, to lead minds astray
by accustoming them to servitude"*. [**The State: Its Historic Role**,
pp. 57-8] A social revolution needs new, non-statist, forms of social
organisation to succeed:

> "To give full scope to socialism entails rebuilding from top to bottom
> a society dominated by the narrow individualism of the shopkeeper. It
> is not as has sometimes been said by those indulging in metaphysical
> wooliness just a question of giving the worker 'the total product of

> this immense transformation. They want to direct the renewal of a
> society by means of decrees and electoral majorities... How
> ridiculous!" [Kropotkin, **Op. Cit.**, pp. 58-9]

Ultimately, the question, of course, is one of power. Does the
*"executive committee"* have the fundamental decision making power in
society, or does that power lie in the mass assemblies upon which a
federal socialist society is built? If the former, we have rule by a few
party leaders and the inevitable bureaucratisation of the society and a
state in the accepted sense of the word. If the latter, we have a basic
structure of a free and equal society and a new organisation of popular
self-management which eliminates the existence of a public power above
society. This is not playing with words. It signifies the key issue of
social transformation, an issue which Marxism tends to ignore or confuse
matters about when discussing. Bookchin clarified what is at stake:

> *"To some neo-Marxists who see centralisation and decentralisation
> merely as difference of degree, the word 'centralisation' may merely
> be an awkward way of denoting means for **co-ordinating** the
> decisions made by decentralised bodies. Marx, it is worth noting,
> greatly confused this distinction when he praised the Paris Commune as
> a 'working, not a parliamentary body, executive and legislative at the
> same time.' In point of fact, the consolidation of 'executive and
> legislative' functions in a single body was regressive. It simply
> identified the process of policy-making, a function that rightly
> should belong to the people in assembly, with the technical execution
> of these policies, a function that should be left to strictly
> administrative bodies subject to rotation, recall, limitations of
> tenure . . . Accordingly, the melding of policy formation with
> administration placed the institutional emphasis of classical
> [Marxist] socialism on centralised bodies, indeed, by an ironical
> twist of historical events, bestowing the privilege of formulating
> policy on the 'higher bodies' of socialist hierarchies and their
> execution precisely on the more popular 'revolutionary committees'
> below."* [**Toward an Ecological Society**, pp. 215-6]

By confusing co-ordination with the state (i.e. with delegation of
power), Marxism opens the door wide open to the *"dictatorship of the
proletariat"* being a state *"in the proper sense."* In fact, not only
does Marxism open that door, it even invites the state *"in the proper
sense"* in! This can be seen from Engels comment that just as *"each
political party sets out to establish its rule in the state, so the
German Social-Democratic Workers' Party is striving to establish **its**
rule, the rule of the working class."* [**Collected Works**, vol. 23, p.
372] By confusing rule by the party *"in the state"* with *"rule of the
working class,"* Engels is confusing party power and popular power. For
the party to *"establish **its** rule,"* the state in the normal sense
(i.e. a structure based on the delegation of power) has to be
maintained. As such, the *"dictatorship of the proletariat"* signifies
the delegation of power by the proletariat into the hands of the party
and that implies a *"public power distinct from the mass of the people"*
and so minority rule. This aspect of Marxism, as we argue in the [next
section](secH3.html#sech38), was developed under the Bolsheviks and
became *"the dictatorship of the party"* (i.e. the dictatorship **over**
the proletariat):

> "since Marx vigorously opposed Bakunin's efforts to ensure that only
> libertarian and decentralist means were employed by revolutionaries so
> as to facilitate the revolution remaining in the hands of the mass of
> workers, he must accept a fair measure of culpability for the
> authoritarian outcome of the Russian Revolution . . .
> "Bakunin was not satisfied with trusting revolutionary leaders to
> liberate the oppressed . . . The oppressed people had to made aware
> that the only security against replacing one repressive structure with
> another was the deliberate retaining of control of the revolution by
> the whole of the working classes, and not naively trusting it to some
> vanguard." [Alan Carter, **Marx: A Radical Critique** pp. 218-9]

It is for this reason why anarchists are extremely critical of Marxist
ideas of social revolution. As Alan Carter argues:

> *"It is to argue not against revolution, but against 'revolutionary'
> praxis employing central authority. It is to argue that any revolution
> must remain in the hands of the mass of people and that they must be
> aware of the dangers of allowing power to fall into the hands of a

> revolutionary circles as long as the Marxist theory of the state and
> the corresponding theory of power remain above criticism within
> them."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 231]

In summary, the Marxist theory of the state is simply a-historic and
postulates some kind of state "essence" which exists independently of
actual states and their role in society. To confuse the organ required
by a minority class to execute and maintain its rule and that required
by a majority class to manage society is to make a theoretical error of
great magnitude. It opens the door to the idea of party power and even
party dictatorship. As such, the Marxism of Marx and Engels is confused
on the issue of the state. Their comments fluctuate between the
anarchist definition of the state (based, as it is, on generalisations
from historical examples) and the a-historic definition (based not on
historical example but rather derived from a supra-historical analysis).
Trying to combine the metaphysical with the scientific, the
authoritarian with the libertarian, could only leave their followers
with a confused legacy and that is what we find.

Since the death of the founding fathers of Marxism, their followers have
diverged into two camps. The majority have embraced the metaphysical and
authoritarian concept of the state and proclaimed their support for a
*"workers' state."* This is represented by social-democracy and it
radical offshoot, Leninism. As we discuss in the [next
section](secH3.html#sech38), this school has used the Marxist conception
of the state to allow for rule over the working class by the
*"revolutionary"* party. The minority has become increasingly and
explicitly anti-state, recognising that the Marxist legacy is
contradictory and that for the proletarian to directly manage society
then there can be no power above them. To this camp belongs the
libertarian Marxists of the council communist, Situationist and other
schools of thought which are close to anarchism.

H.3.8 What is wrong with the Leninist theory of the state?
----------------------------------------------------------

As discussed in the [last section](secH3.html#sech37), there is a
contradiction at the heart of the Marxist theory of the state. On the
one hand, it acknowledges that the state, historically, has always been
an instrument of minority rule and is structured to ensure this. On the
other, it argues that you can have a state (the *"dictatorship of the
proletariat"*) which transcends this historical reality to express an
abstract essence of the state as an *"instrument of class rule."* This
means that Marxism usually confuses two very different concepts, namely
the state (a structure based on centralisation and delegated power) and
the popular self-management and self-organisation required to create and
defend a socialist society.

This confusion between two fundamentally different concepts proved to be
disastrous when the Russian Revolution broke out. Confusing party power
with working class power, the Bolsheviks aimed to create a "workers'
state" in which their party would be in power (see [section
H.3.3](secH3.html#secH.3.3)). As the state was an instrument of class
rule, it did not matter if the new "workers' state" was centralised,
hierarchical and top-down like the old state as the structure of the
state was considered irrelevant in evaluating its role in society. Thus,
while Lenin seemed to promise a radical democracy in which the working
class would directly manage its own affairs in his **State and
Revolution**, in practice he implemented a *"dictatorship of the
proletariat"* which was, in fact, *"the organisation of the vanguard of
the oppressed as the ruling class."* [**Essential Works of Lenin**, p.
337] In other words, the vanguard party in the position of head of the
state, governing on behalf of the working class which, in turn, meant
that the new "workers' state" was fundamentally a state in the usual
sense of the word. This quickly lead to a dictatorship **over**, not of,
the proletariat (as Bakunin had predicted). This development did not
come as a surprise to anarchists, who had long argued that a state is an
instrument of minority rule and cannot change its nature. To use the
state to affect socialist change is impossible, simply because it is not
designed for such a task. As we argued in [section B.2](secB2.html), the
state is based on centralisation of power explicitly to ensure minority
rule and for this reason has to be abolished during a social revolution.

As Voline summarised, there is *"an explicit, irreconcilable
contradiction between the very essence of State Socialist power (if it
triumphs) and that of the true Social Revolutionary process."* This was
because *"**the basis of State Socialism** and delegated power is **the
explicit non-recognition of [the] principles of the Social Revolution.**
The characteristic traits of Socialist ideology and practice . . . do
not belong to the future, but are wholly a part of the bourgeois past .
. . Once this model has been applied, the true principles of the
Revolution are fatally abandoned. Then follows, inevitably, the rebirth,
under another name, of the exploitation of the labouring masses, with
all its consequences."* Thus *"the forward march of the revolutionary
masses towards real emancipation, towards the creation of new forms of
social life, is incompatible with the very principle of State power . .
. the authoritarian principle and the revolutionary principle are
diametrically opposed and mutually exclusive."* [**The Unknown
Revolution**, p. 247 and p. 248]

Ironically, the theoretical lessons Leninists gained from the experience
of the Russian Revolution confirm the anarchist analysis that the state
structure exists to facilitate minority rule and marginalise and
disempower the majority to achieve that rule. This can be seen from the
significant revision of the Marxist position which occurred once the
Bolshevik party become the ruling party. Simply put, after 1917 leading
representatives of Leninism stressed that state power was **not**
required to repress resistance by the ex-ruling class as such, but, in
fact, was also necessitated by the divisions within the working class.
In other words, state power was required because the working class was
not able to govern itself and so required a grouping (the party) above
it to ensure the success of the revolution and overcome any *"wavering"*
within the masses themselves.

While we have discussed this position in [section
H.1.2](secH1.html#sech12) and so will be repeating ourselves to some
degree, it is worth summarising again the arguments put forward to
justify this revision. This is because they confirm what anarchists have
always argued, namely that the state is an instrument of minority rule
and **not** one by which working class people can manage their own
affairs directly. As the quotations from leading Leninists make clear,
it is **precisely** this feature of the state which recommends it for
party (i.e. minority) power. The contradiction at the heart of the
Marxist theory of the state we pointed out in the [section
H.3.7](secH3.html#sech37) has been resolved in Leninism. It supports the
state precisely because it is *"a public power distinct from the mass of
the people,"* rather than an instrument of working class self-management
of society.

Needless to say, his latter day followers point to Lenin's apparently
democratic, even libertarian, sounding 1917 work, **The State and
Revolution** when asked about the Leninist theory of the state. As our
discussion in [section H.1.7](secH1.html#sech17) proved, the ideas
expounded in his pamphlet were rarely, if at all, applied in practice by
the Bolsheviks. Moreover, it was written before the seizure of power. In
order to see the validity of his argument we must compare it to his and
his fellow Bolshevik leaders opinions once the revolution had
"succeeded." What lessons did they generalise from their experiences and
how did these lessons relate to **State and Revolution**?

The change can be seen from Trotsky, who argued quite explicitly that
*"the proletariat can take power only through its vanguard"* and that
*"the necessity for state power arises from an insufficient cultural
level of the masses and their heterogeneity."* Only with *"support of
the vanguard by the class"* can there be the *"conquest of power"* and
it was in *"this sense the proletarian revolution and dictatorship are
the work of the whole class, but only under the leadership of the
vanguard."* Thus, rather than the working class as a whole seizing
power, it is the *"vanguard"* which takes power - *"a revolutionary
party, even after seizing power . . . is still by no means the sovereign
ruler of society."* Thus state power is required to **govern the
masses,** who cannot exercise power themselves. As Trotsky put it,
*"[t]hose who propose the abstraction of Soviets to the party
dictatorship should understand that only thanks to the Bolshevik
leadership were the Soviets able to lift themselves out of the mud of
reformism and attain the state form of the proletariat."* [**Writings
1936-37**, p. 490, p. 488 and p. 495]

Logically, though, this places the party in a privileged position. So
what happens if the working class no longer supports the vanguard? Who
takes priority? Unsurprisingly, in both theory and practice, the party
is expected to rule over the masses. This idea that state power was
required due to the limitations within the working class is reiterated a
few years later in 1939. Moreover, the whole rationale for party
dictatorship came from the fundamental rationale for democracy, namely
that any government should reflect the changing opinions of the masses:

> *"The very same masses are at different times inspired by different
> moods and objectives. It is just for this reason that a centralised
> organisation of the vanguard is indispensable. Only a party, wielding
> the authority it has won, is capable of overcoming the vacillation of
> the masses themselves . . . if the dictatorship of the proletariat
> means anything at all, then it means that the vanguard of the
> proletariat is armed with the resources of the state in order to repel
> dangers, including those emanating from the backward layers of the
> proletariat itself."* [*"The Moralists and Sycophants against
> Marxism"*, pp. 53-66, **Their Morals and Ours**, p. 59]

Needless to say, **by definition** everyone is *"backward"* when
compared to the *"vanguard of the proletariat."* Moreover, as it is this
*"vanguard"* which is *"armed with the resources of the state"* and
**not** the proletariat as a whole we are left with one obvious
conclusion, namely party dictatorship rather than working class
democracy. How Trotsky's position is compatible with the idea of the
working class as the "ruling class" is not explained. However, it fits
in well with the anarchist analysis of the state as an instrument
designed to ensure minority rule.

Thus the possibility of party dictatorship exists if popular support
fades. Which is, significantly, precisely what **had** happened when
Lenin and Trotsky were in power. In fact, these arguments built upon
other, equally elitist statement which had been expressed by Trotsky
when he held the reins of power. In 1920, for example, he argued that
while the Bolsheviks have *"more than once been accused of having
substituted for the dictatorship of the Soviets the dictatorship of the
party,"* in fact *"it can be said with complete justice that the
dictatorship of the Soviets became possible only by means of the
dictatorship of the party."* This, just to state the obvious, was his
argument seventeen years later. *"In this 'substitution' of the power of
the party for the power of the working class,"* Trotsky added, *"there
is nothing accidental, and in reality there is no substitution at all.
The Communists express the fundamental interests of the working class."*
[**Terrorism and Communism**, p. 109] In early 1921, he argued again for
Party dictatorship at the Tenth Party Congress:

> *"The Workers' Opposition has come out with dangerous slogans, making
> a fetish of democratic principles! They place the workers' right to
> elect representatives above the Party, as if the party were not
> entitled to assert its dictatorship even if that dictatorship
> temporarily clashed with the passing moods of the workers' democracy.
> It is necessary to create amongst us the awareness of the
> revolutionary birthright of the party, which is obliged to maintain
> its dictatorship, regardless of temporary wavering even in the working
> classes. This awareness is for us the indispensable element. The
> dictatorship does not base itself at every given moment on the formal
> principle of a workers' democracy."* [quoted by Samuel Farber,
> **Before Stalinism**, p. 209]

The similarities with his arguments of 1939 are obvious. Unsurprisingly,
he maintained this position in the intervening years. He stated in 1922
that *"we maintain the dictatorship of our party!"* [**The First Five
Years of the Communist International**, vol. 2, p. 255] The next year
saw him arguing that *"[i]f there is one question which basically not
only does not require revision but does not so much as admit the thought
of revision, it is the question of the dictatorship of the Party."* He
stressed that *"[o]ur party is the ruling party"* and that *"[t]o allow
any changes whatever in this field"* meant *"bring[ing] into question
all the achievements of the revolution and its future."* He indicated
the fate of those who **did** question the party's position: *"Whoever
makes an attempt on the party's leading role will, I hope, be
unanimously dumped by all of us on the other side of the barricade."*
[**Leon Trotsky Speaks**, p. 158 and p. 160]

By 1927, when Trotsky was in the process of being *"dumped"* on the
*"other side of the barricade"* by the ruling bureaucracy, he **still**
argued for *"the Leninist principle, inviolable for every Bolshevik,
that the dictatorship of the proletariat is and can be realised only
through the dictatorship of the party."* It was stressed that the
*"dictatorship of the proletariat [sic!] demands as its very core a
single proletarian party."* [**The Challenge of the Left Opposition
(1926-7)**, p. 395 and p. 441] As we noted in [section
H.1.2](secH1.html#sech12), ten years later, he was still explicitly
arguing for the *"revolutionary dictatorship of a proletarian party"*.

Thus, for Trotsky over a twenty year period, the *"dictatorship of the
proletariat"* was fundamentally a *"dictatorship of the party."* While
the working class may be allowed some level of democracy, the rule of
the party was repeatedly given precedence. While the party may be placed
into power by a mass revolution, once there the party would maintain its
position of power and dismiss attempts by the working class to replace
it as *"wavering"* or *"vacillation"* due to the *"insufficient cultural
level of the masses and their heterogeneity."* In other words, the party
dictatorship was required to protect working class people from
themselves, their tendency to change their minds based on changing
circumstances, evaluating the results of past decisions, debates between
different political ideas and positions, make their own decisions,
reject what is in their best interests (as determined by the party), and
so on. Thus the underlying rationale for democracy (namely that it
reflects the changing will of the voters, their *"passing moods"* so to
speak) is used to justify party dictatorship!

The importance of party power **over** the working class was not limited
to Trotsky. It was considered of general validity by all leading
Bolsheviks and, moreover, quickly became mainstream Bolshevik ideology.
In March 1923, for example, the Central Committee of the Communist Party
in a statement issued to mark the 25th anniversary of the founding of
the Bolshevik Party. This statement summarised the lessons gained from
the Russian revolution. It stated that *"the party of the Bolsheviks
proved able to stand out fearlessly against the vacillations within its
own class, vacillations which, with the slightest weakness in the
vanguard, could turn into an unprecedented defeat for the proletariat."*
Vacillations, of course, are expressed by workers' democracy. Little
wonder the statement rejects it: *"The dictatorship of the working class
finds its expression in the dictatorship of the party."* [*"To the
Workers of the USSR"* in G. Zinoviev, **History of the Bolshevik
Party**, p. 213 and p. 214]

Trotsky and other leading Bolsheviks were simply following Lenin's lead,
who had admitted at the end of 1920 that while *"the dictatorship of the
proletariat"* was *"inevitable"* in the *"transition of socialism,"* it
is *"not exercised by an organisation which takes in all industrial
workers."* The reason *"is given in the theses of the Second Congress of
the Communist International on the role of political parties"* (more on
which later). This means that *"the Party, shall we say, absorbs the
vanguard of the proletariat, and this vanguard exercises the
dictatorship of the proletariat."* This was required because *"in all
capitalist countries . . . the proletariat is still so divided, so
degraded, and so corrupted in parts"* that it *"can be exercised only by
a vanguard . . . the dictatorship of the proletariat cannot be exercised
by a mass proletarian organisation."* [**Collected Works**, vol. 32, p.
20 and p. 21] For Lenin, *"revolutionary coercion is bound to be
employed towards the wavering and unstable elements among the masses
themselves."* [**Op. Cit.**, vol. 42, p. 170] Needless to say, Lenin
failed to mention this aspect of his system in **The State and
Revolution** (a failure usually repeated by his followers). It is,
however, a striking confirmation of Bakunin's comments *"the State
cannot be sure of its own self-preservation without an armed force to
defend it against its own **internal enemies,** against the discontent
of its own people."* [**Michael Bakunin: Selected Writings**, p. 265]

Looking at the lessons leading leaders of Leninism gained from the
experience of the Russian Revolution, we have to admit that the Leninist
*"workers' state"* will not be, in fact, a *"new"* kind of state, a
*"semi-state,"* or, to quote Lenin, a *"new state"* which *"is **no
longer** a state in the proper sense of the word."* If, as Lenin argued
in early 1917, the state *"in the proper sense of the term is domination
over the people by contingents of armed men divorced from the people,"*
then Bolshevism in power quickly saw the need for a state *"in the
proper sense."* [**Op. Cit.**, vol. 24, p. 85] While this state *"in the
proper sense"* had existed from the start of Bolshevik rule, it was only
from early 1919 onwards (at the latest) that the leaders of Bolshevism
had openly brought what they said into line with what they did. It was
only by being a *"state in the proper sense"* could the Bolshevik party
rule and exercise *"the dictatorship of the party"* over the
*"wavering"* working class.

So when Lenin stated that *"Marxism differs from anarchism in that it
recognises **the need for a state** for the purpose of the transition to
socialism,"* anarchists agree. [**Op. Cit.**, vol. 24, p. 85] Insofar as
"Marxism" aims for, to quote Lenin, the party to *"take state power into
[its] own hands,"* to become *"the governing party"* and considers one
of its key tasks for *"our Party to capture political power"* and to
*"administer"* a country, then we can safely say that the state needed
is a state *"in the proper sense,"* based on the centralisation and
delegation of power into the hands of a few (see our discussion of
Leninism as ***"socialism from above"*** in [section
H.3.3](secH3.html#sech33) for details).

This recreation of the state *"in the proper sense"* did not come about
by chance or simply because of the *"will to power"* of the leaders of
Bolshevism. Rather, there are strong institutional pressures at work
within any state structure (even a so-called *"semi-state"*) to turn it
back into a *"proper"* state. We discuss this in more detail in [section
H.3.9](secH3.html#sech39). However, we should not ignore that many of
the roots of Bolshevik tyranny can be found in the contradictions of the
Marxist theory of the state. As noted in the [last
section](secH3.html#sech37), for Engels, the seizure of power by the
party meant that the working class was in power. The Leninist tradition
builds on this confusion between party and class power. It is clear that
the *"dictatorship of the proletariat"* is, in fact, rule by the party.
In Lenin's words:

> *"Engels speaks of **a government that is required for the domination
> of a class** . . . Applied to the proletariat, it consequently means a
> government **that is required for the domination of the proletariat,**
> i.e. the dictatorship of the proletariat for the effectuation of the
> socialist revolution."* [**Op. Cit.**, vol. 8, p. 279]

The role of the working class in this state was also indicated, as
*"only a revolutionary dictatorship supported by the vast majority of
the people can be at all durable."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 291] In other
words the *"revolutionary government"* has the power, not the working
class in whose name it governs. In 1921 he made this explicit: *"To
govern you need an army of steeled revolutionary Communists. We have it,
and it is called the Party."* The *"Party is the leader, the vanguard of
the proletariat, which rules directly."* For Lenin, as *"long as we, the
Party's Central Committee and the whole Party, continue to run things,
that is govern we shall never - we cannot - dispense with . . .
removals, transfers, appointments, dismissals, etc."* of workers,
officials and party members from above. [**Op. Cit.**, vol. 32, p. 62,
p. 98 and p. 99] Unsurprisingly, these powers were used by Lenin, and
then Stalin, to destroy opposition (although the latter applied coercive
measures **within** the party which Lenin only applied to non-party
opponents).

So much for *"workers' power,"* *"socialism from below"* and other such
rhetoric.

This vision of "socialism" being rooted in party power over the working
class was the basis of the Communist International's resolution of the
role of the party. This resolution is, therefore, important and worth
discussing. It argues that the Communist Party *"is **part** of the
working class,"* namely its *"most advanced, most class-conscious, and
therefore most revolutionary part."* It is *"distinguished from the
working class as a whole in that it grasps the whole historic path of
the working class in its entirety and at every bend in that road
endeavours to defend not the interests of individual groups or
occupations but the interests of the working class as a whole."*
[**Proceedings and Documents of the Second Congress 1920**, vol. 1, p.
191] However, in response it can be argued that this simply means the
*"interests of the party"* as only it can understand what *"the
interests of the working class as a whole"* actually are. Thus we have
the possibility of the party substituting its will for that of the
working class simply because of what Leninists term the *"uneven
development"* of the working class. As Alan Carter argues, these
*"conceptions of revolutionary organisation maintain political and
ideological domination by retaining supervisory roles and notions of
privileged access to knowledge . . . the term 'class consciousness' is
employed to facilitate such domination over the workers. It is not what
the workers think, but what the party leaders think they ought to think
that constitutes the revolutionary consciousness imputed to the
workers."* The ideological basis for a new class structure is created as
the *"Leninist revolutionary praxis . . . is carried forward to
post-revolutionary institutions,"* [**Marx: A Radical Critique**, p.
175]

The resolution stresses that before the revolution, the party *"will
encompass . . . only a minority of the workers."* Even after the
*"seizure of power,"* it will still *"not be able to unite them all into
its ranks organisationally."* It is only after the *"final defeat of the
bourgeois order"* will *"all or almost all workers begin to join"* it.
Thus the party is a **minority** of the working class. The resolution
then goes on to state that *"[e]very class struggle is a political
struggle. This struggle, which inevitably becomes transformed into civil
war, has as its goal the conquest of political power. Political power
cannot be seized, organised, and directed other than by some kind of
political party."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 192, p. 193] And as the party is a
*"part"* of the working class which cannot *"unite"* all workers *"into
its ranks,"* this means that political power can only be *"seized,
organised, and directed"* by a **minority.**

Thus we have minority rule, with the party (or more correctly its
leaders) exercising political power. The idea that the party *"must
**dissolve** into the councils, that the councils can **replace** the
Communist Party"* is *"fundamentally wrong and reactionary."* This is
because, to *"enable the soviets to fulfil their historic tasks, there
must . . . be a strong Communist Party, one that does not simply 'adapt'
to the soviets but is able to make them renounce 'adaptation' to the
bourgeoisie."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 196] Thus rather than the workers'
councils exercising power, their role is simply that of allowing the
Communist Party to seize political power.

As we indicated in [section H.3.4](secH3.html#sech34), the underlying
assumption behind this resolution was made clear by Zinoviev during his
introductory speech to the congress meeting which finally agreed the
resolution: the dictatorship of the party **was** the dictatorship of
the proletariat. Little wonder that Bertrand Russell, on his return from
Lenin's Russia in 1920, wrote that:

> *"Friends of Russia here [in Britain] think of the dictatorship of the
> proletariat as merely a new form of representative government, in
> which only working men and women have votes, and the constituencies
> are partly occupational, not geographical. They think that
> 'proletariat' means 'proletariat,' but 'dictatorship' does not quite
> mean 'dictatorship.' This is the opposite of the truth. When a Russian
> Communist speak of a dictatorship, he means the word literally, but
> when he speaks of the proletariat, he means the word in a Pickwickian
> sense. He means the 'class-conscious' part of the proletariat, i.e.
> the Communist Party. He includes people by no means proletarian (such
> as Lenin and Tchicherin) who have the right opinions, and he excludes
> such wage-earners as have not the right opinions, whom he classifies
> as lackeys of the **bourgeoisie.**"* [**The Practice and Theory of
> Bolshevism**, pp. 26-27]

Significantly, Russell pointed, like Lenin, to the Comintern resolution
on the role of the Communist Party. In addition, he noted the reason why
this party dictatorship was required: *"No conceivable system of free
elections would give majorities to the Communists, either in the town or
country."* [**Op. Cit.**, pp. 40-1]

Nor are followers of Bolshevism shy in repeating its elitist
conclusions. Founder and leader of the British SWP, Tony Cliff, for
example, showed his lack of commitment to working class democracy when
he opined that the *"actual level of democracy, as well as centralism,
[during a revolution] depends on three basic factors: 1. the strength of
the proletariat; 2. the material and cultural legacy left to it by the
old regime; and 3. the strength of capitalist resistance. The level of
democracy feasible must be in direct proportion to the first two
factors, and in inverse proportion to the third. The captain of an ocean
liner can allow football to be played on his vessel; on a tiny raft in a
stormy sea the level of tolerance is far lower."* [**Lenin**, vol. 3, p.
179] That Cliff compares working class democracy to football says it
all. Rather than seeing it as the core gain of a revolution, he
relegates it to the level of a **game,** which may or may not be
*"tolerated"*! And need we speculate who the paternalistic *"captain"*
in charge of the ship of the state would be?

Replacing Cliff's revealing analogies we get the following: *"The party
in charge of a workers' state can allow democracy when the capitalist
class is not resisting; when it is resisting strongly, the level of
tolerance is far lower."* So, democracy will be *"tolerated"* in the
extremely unlikely situation that the capitalist class will not resist a
revolution! That the party has no right to *"tolerate"* democracy or not
is not even entertained by Cliff, its right to negate the basic rights
of the working class is taken as a given. Clearly the key factor is that
the party is in power. It **may** *"tolerate"* democracy, but ultimately
his analogy shows that Bolshevism considers it as an added extra whose
(lack of) existence in no way determines the nature of the *"workers'
state"* (unless, of course, he is analysing Stalin's regime rather than
Lenin's then it becomes of critical importance!). Perhaps, therefore, we
may add another *"basic factor"* to Cliff's three; namely *"4. the
strength of working class support for the party."* The level of
democracy feasible must be in direct proportion to this factor, as the
Bolsheviks made clear. As long as the workers vote for the party, then
democracy is wonderful. If they do not, then their *"wavering"* and
*"passing moods"* cannot be *"tolerated"* and democracy is replaced by
the dictatorship of the party. Which is no democracy at all.

Obviously, then, if, as Engels argued, *"an essential feature of the
state is a public power distinct from the mass of the people"* then the
regime advocated by Bolshevism is not a *"semi-state"* but, in fact, a
normal state. Trotsky and Lenin are equally clear that said state exists
to ensure that the *"mass of the people"* do not participate in public
power, which is exercised by a minority, the party (or, more correctly,
the leaders of the party). One of the key aims of this new state is to
repress the *"backward"* or *"wavering"* sections of the working class
(although, by definition, all sections of the working class are
*"backward"* in relation to the *"vanguard"*). Hence the need for a
*"public power distinct from the people"* (as the suppression of the
strike wave and Kronstadt in 1921 shows, elite troops are always needed
to stop the army siding with their fellow workers). And as proven by
Trotsky's comments after he was squeezed out of power, this perspective
was **not** considered as a product of *"exceptional circumstances."*
Rather it was considered a basic lesson of the revolution, a position
which was applicable to all future revolutions. In this, Lenin and other
leading Bolsheviks concurred.

The irony (and tragedy) of all this should not be lost. In his 1905
diatribe against anarchism, Stalin had denied that Marxists aimed for
party dictatorship. He stressed that there was *"a dictatorship of the
minority, the dictatorship of a small group . . . which is directed
against the people . . . Marxists are the enemies of such a
dictatorship, and they fight such a dictatorship far more stubbornly and
self-sacrificingly than do our noisy Anarchists."* The practice of
Bolshevism and the ideological revisions it generated easily refutes
Stalin's claims. The practice of Bolshevism showed that his claim that
*"[a]t the head"* of the *"dictatorship of the proletarian majority . .
. stand the masses"* is in sharp contradiction with Bolshevik support
for *"revolutionary"* governments. Either you have (to use Stalin's
expression) *"the dictatorship of the streets, of the masses, a
dictatorship directed against all oppressors"* or you have party power
**in the name of the street, of the masses.** [**Collected Works**, vol.
1, p. 371-2] The fundamental flaw in Leninism is that it confuses the
two and so lays the ground for the very result anarchists predicted and
Stalin denied.

While anarchists are well aware of the need to defend a revolution (see
[section H.2.1](secH2.html#sech21)), we do not make the mistake of
equating this with a state. Ultimately, the state cannot be used as an
instrument of liberation - it is not designed for it. Which,
incidentally, is why we have not discussed the impact of the Russian
Civil War on the development of Bolshevik ideology. Simply put, the
*"workers' state"* is proposed, by Leninists, as the means to defend a
revolution. As such, you cannot blame what it is meant to be designed to
withstand (counter-revolution and civil war) for its *"degeneration."*
If the *"workers' state"* cannot handle what its advocates claim it
exists for, then its time to look for an alternative and dump the
concept in the dustbin of history.

In summary, Bolshevism is based on a substantial revision of the Marxist
theory of the state. While Marx and Engels were at pains to stress the
accountability of their new state to the population under it, Leninism
has made a virtue of the fact that the state has evolved to exclude that
mass participation in order to ensure minority rule. Leninism has done
so explicitly to allow the party to overcome the *"wavering"* of the
working class, the very class it claims is the "ruling class" under
socialism! In doing this, the Leninist tradition exploited the confused
nature of the state theory of traditional Marxism. The Leninist theory
of the state is flawed simply because it is based on creating a *"state
in the proper sense of the word,"* with a public power distinct from the
mass of the people. This was the major lesson gained by the leading
Bolsheviks (including Lenin and Trotsky) from the Russian Revolution and
has its roots in the common Marxist error of confusing party power with
working class power. So when Leninists point to Lenin's **State and
Revolution** as the definitive Leninist theory of the state, anarchists
simply point to the lessons Lenin himself gained from actually
conducting a revolution. Once we do, the slippery slope to the Leninist
solution to the contradictions inherit in the Marxist theory of the
state can be seen, understood and combated.

H.3.9 Is the state simply an agent of economic power?
-----------------------------------------------------

As we discussed in [section H.3.7](secH3.html#sech37), the Marxist
theory of the state confuses an empirical analysis of the state with a
metaphysical one. While Engels is aware that the state developed to
ensure minority class rule and, as befits its task, evolved specific
characteristics to execute that role, he also raised the idea that the
state (*"as a rule"*) is *"the state of the most powerful, economically
dominant class"* and *"through the medium of the state, becomes also the
politically dominant class."* Thus the state can be considered, in
essence, as *"nothing but a machine for the oppression of one class by
another."* *"At a certain stage of economic development"*, Engels
stressed, *"which was necessarily bound up with the split in society
into classes, the state became a necessity owning to this split."*
[**Selected Works**, pp. 577-8, p. 579 and p. 258] For Lenin, this was
*"the basic idea of Marxism on the question of the historical role and
meaning of the state,"* namely that *"the state is an organ of class
**rule**, the organ for the **oppression** of one class by another."*
[**Essential Works of Lenin**, p. 273 and p. 274]

The clear implication is that the state is simply an instrument, without
special interests of its own. If this is the case, the use of a state by
the proletariat is unproblematic (and so the confusion between working
class self-organisation and the state we have discussed in various
sections above is irrelevant). This argument can lead to simplistic
conclusions, such as once a "revolutionary" government is in power in a
"workers state" we need not worry about abuses of power or even civil
liberties (this position was commonplace in Bolshevik ranks during the
Russian Civil War, for example). It also is at the heart of Trotsky's
contortions with regards to Stalinism, refusing to see the state
bureaucracy as a new ruling class simply because the state, by
definition, could not play such a role.

For anarchists, this position is a fundamental weakness of Marxism, a
sign that the mainstream Marxist position significantly misunderstands
the nature of the state and the needs of social revolution. However, we
must stress that anarchists would agree that the state generally does
serve the interests of the economically dominant classes. Bakunin, for
example, argued that the State *"is authority, domination, and forced,
organised by the property-owning and so-called enlightened classes
against the masses."* He saw the social revolution as destroying
capitalism and the state at the same time, that is *"to overturn the
State's domination, and that of the privileged classes whom it solely
represents."* [**The Basic Bakunin**, p. 140] However, anarchists do not
reduce our analysis and understanding of the state to this simplistic
Marxist level. While being well aware that the state is the means of
ensuring the domination of an economic elite, as we discussed in
[section B.2.5](secB2.html#secb25), anarchists recognise that the state
machine also has interests of its own. The state, for anarchists, is the
delegation of power into the hands of a few. This creates, by its very
nature, a privileged position for those at the top of the hierarchy:

> *"A government [or state], that is a group of people entrusted with
> making the laws and empowered to use the collective force to oblige
> each individual to obey them, is already a privileged class and cut
> off from the people. As any constituted body would do, it will
> instinctively seek to extend its powers, to be beyond public control,
> to impose its own policies and to give priority to its special
> interests. Having been put in a privileged position, the government is
> already at odds with the people whose strength it disposes of."*
> [Malatesta, **Anarchy**, p. 36]

The Bolshevik regime during the Russia revolution proved the validity of
this analysis. The Bolsheviks seized power in the name of the soviets
yet soon marginalised, gerrymandered and disbanded them to remain in
power while imposing a vision of socialism (more correctly, state
capitalism) at odds with popular aspirations.

Why this would be the case is not hard to discover. Given that the state
is a highly centralised, top-down structure it is unsurprising that it
develops around itself a privileged class, a bureaucracy, around it. The
inequality in power implied by the state is a source of privilege and
oppression independent of property and economic class. Those in charge
of the state's institutions would aim to protect (and expand) their area
of operation, ensuring that they select individuals who share their
perspectives and who they can pass on their positions. By controlling
the flow of information, of personnel and resources, the members of the
state's higher circles can ensure its, and their own, survival and
prosperity. As such, politicians who are elected are at a disadvantage.
The state is the permanent collection of institutions that have
entrenched power structures and interests. The politicians come and go
while the power in the state lies in its institutions due to their
permanence. It is to be expected that such institutions would have their
own interests and would pursue them whenever they can.

This would not fundamentally change in a new "workers' state" as it is,
like all states, based on the delegation and centralisation of power
into a few hands. Any "workers' government" would need a new apparatus
to enforce its laws and decrees. It would need effective means of
gathering and collating information. It would thus create *"an entirely
new ladder of administration to extend it rule and make itself obeyed."*
While a social revolution needs mass participation, the state limits
initiative to the few who are in power and *"it will be impossible for
one or even a number of individuals to elaborate the social forms"*
required, which *"can only be the collective work of the masses . . .
Any kind of external authority will merely be an obstacle, a hindrance
to the organic work that has to be accomplished; it will be no better
than a source of discord and of hatreds."* [Kropotkin, **Words of a
Rebel**, p. 169 and pp. 176-7]

Rather than "withering away," any "workers' state" would tend to grow in
terms of administration and so the government creates around itself a
class of bureaucrats whose position is different from the rest of
society. This would apply to production as well. Being unable to manage
everything, the state would have to re-introduce hierarchical management
in order to ensure its orders are met and that a suitable surplus is
extracted from the workers to feed the needs of the state machine. By
creating an economically powerful class which it can rely on to
discipline the workforce, it would simply recreate capitalism anew in
the form of *"state capitalism"* (this is precisely what happened during
the Russian Revolution). To enforce its will onto the people it claims
to represent, specialised bodies of armed people (police, army) would be
required and soon created. All of which is to be expected, as state
socialism *"entrusts to a few the management of social life and [so]
leads to the exploitation and oppression of the masses by the few."*
[Malatesta, **Op. Cit.**, p. 47]

This process takes time. However, the tendency for government to escape
from popular control and to generate privileged and powerful
institutions around it can be seen in all revolutions, including the
Paris Commune and the Russian Revolution. In the former, the Communal
Council was *"largely ignored . . . after it was installed. The
insurrection, the actual management of the city's affairs and finally
the fighting against the Versaillese, were undertaken mainly by popular
clubs, the neighbourhood vigilance committees, and the battalions of the
National Guard. Had the Paris Commune (the Municipal Council) survived,
it is extremely doubtful that it could have avoided conflict with these
loosely formed street and militia formations. Indeed, by the end of
April, some six weeks after the insurrection, the Commune constituted an
'all-powerful' Committee of Public Safety, a body redolent with memories
of the Jacobin dictatorship and the Terror , which suppressed not only
the right in the Great [French] Revolution of a century earlier, but
also the left."* [Murray Bookchin, **Post-Scarcity Anarchism**, p. 90] A
minority of council members (essentially those active in the
International) stated that *"the Paris Commune has surrendered its
authority to a dictatorship"* and it was *"hiding behind a dictatorship
that the electorate have not authorised us to accept or to recognise."*
[**The Paris Commune of 1871: The View from the Left**, Eugene Schulkind
(ed.), p. 187] The Commune was crushed before this process could fully
unfold, but the omens were there (although it would have undoubtedly
been hindered by the local scale of the institutions involved). As we
discuss in [section H.6](secH6.html), a similar process of a
"revolutionary" government escaping from popular control occurred right
from the start of the Russian Revolution. The fact the Bolshevik regime
lasted longer and was more centralised (and covered a larger area)
ensured that this process developed fully, with the "revolutionary"
government creating around itself the institutions (the bureaucracy)
which finally subjected the politicians and party leaders to its
influence and then domination.

Simply put, the vision of the state as merely an instrument of class
rule blinds its supporters to the dangers of **political** inequality in
terms of power, the dangers inherent in giving a small group of people
power over everyone else. The state has certain properties **because it
is a state** and one of these is that it creates a bureaucratic class
around it due to its centralised, hierarchical nature. Within
capitalism, the state bureaucracy is (generally) under the control of
the capitalist class. However, to generalise from this specific case is
wrong as the state bureaucracy is a class in itself - and so trying to
abolish classes without abolishing the state is doomed to failure:

> *"The State has always been the patrimony of some privileged class:
> the sacerdotal class, the nobility, the bourgeoisie - and finally,
> when all the other classes have exhausted themselves, the class of the
> bureaucracy enters upon the stage and then the State falls, or rises,
> if you please to the position of a machine."* [Bakunin, **The
> Political Philosophy of Bakunin**, p. 208]

Thus the state cannot simply be considered as an instrument of rule by
economic classes. It can be quite an effective parasitical force in its
own right, as both anthropological and historical evidence suggest. The
former raises the possibility that the state arose before economic
classes and that its roots are in inequalities in power (i.e. hierarchy)
within society, not inequalities of wealth. The latter points to
examples of societies in which the state was not, in fact, an instrument
of (economic) class rule but rather pursued an interest of its own.

As regards anthropology, Michael Taylor summarises that the *"evidence
does not give [the Marxist] proposition [that the rise of economic
classes caused the creation of the state] a great deal of support. Much
of the evidence which has been offered in support of it shows only that
the primary states, not long after their emergence, were economically
stratified. But this is of course consistent also with the simultaneous
rise . . . of political and economic stratification, or with the
**prior** development of the state - i.e. of **political**
stratification - and the creation of economic stratification by the
ruling class."* [**Community, Anarchy and Liberty**, p. 132] He quotes
Elman Service on this:

> *"In all of the archaic civilisations and historically known chiefdoms
> and primitive states the 'stratification' was . . . mainly of two
> classes, the governors and the governed - political strata, not strata
> of ownership groups."* [quoted by Taylor, **Op. Cit.**, p. 133]

Taylor argues that it the *"weakening of community and the development
of gross inequalities are the **concomitants** and **consequences** of
state formation."* He points to the *"germ of state formation"* being in
the informal social hierarchies which exist in tribal societies. [**Op.
Cit.**, p. 133 and p. 134] Thus the state is not, initially, a product
of economic classes but rather an independent development based on
inequalities of social power. Harold Barclay, an anarchist who has
studied anthropological evidence on this matter, concurs:

> *"In Marxist theory power derives primarily, if not exclusively, from
> control of the means of production and distribution of wealth, that
> is, from economic factors. Yet, it is evident that power derived from
> knowledge - and usually 'religious' style knowledge - is often highly
> significant, at least in the social dynamics of small societies. . .
> Economic factors are hardly the only source of power. Indeed, we see
> this in modern society as well, where the capitalist owner does not
> wield total power. Rather technicians and other specialists command it
> as well, not because of their economic wealth, but because of their
> knowledge."* [quoted by Alan Carter, **Marx: A Radical Critique**, p.
> 191]

If, as Bookchin summarises, *"hierarchies precede classes"* then trying
to use a hierarchical structure like the state to abolish them is simply
wishful thinking.

As regards more recent human history, there have been numerous examples
of the state existing without being an instrument of (economic) class
rule. Rather, the state **was** the ruling class. While the most obvious
example is the Stalinist regimes where the state bureaucracy ruled over
a state capitalist economy, there have been plenty of others, as Murray
Bookchin pointed out:

> "Each State is not necessarily an institutionalised system of violence
> in the interests of a specific ruling class, as Marxism would have us
> believe. There are many examples of States that **were** the 'ruling
> class' and whose own interests existed quite apart from - even in
> antagonism to - privileged, presumably 'ruling' classes in a given
> society. The ancient world bears witness to distinctly capitalistic
> classes, often highly privileged and exploitative, that were bilked by
> the State, circumscribed by it, and ultimately devoured by it - which
> is in part why a capitalist society never emerged out of the ancient

> 'represented' no other interest than its own. The same is true of the

Bakunin pointed to Turkish Serbia, where economically dominant classes
*"do not even exist - there is only a bureaucratic class. Thus, the
Serbian state will crush the Serbian people for the sole purpose of
enabling Serbian bureaucrats to live a fatter life."* [**Statism and
Anarchy**, p. 54] Leninist Tony Cliff, in his attempt to prove that
Stalinist Russia was state capitalist and its bureaucracy a ruling
class, pointed to various societies which *"had deep class
differentiation, based not on private property but on state property.
Such systems existed in Pharaonic Egypt, Moslem Egypt, Iraq, Persia and
India."* He discusses the example of Arab feudalism in more detail,
where *"the feudal lord had no permanent domain of his own, but a member
of a class which collectively controlled the land and had the right to
appropriate rent."* This was *"ownership of the land by the state"*
rather than by individuals. [**State Capitalism in Russia**, pp. 316-8]
As such, the idea that the state is simply an instrument of class rule
seems unsupportable. As Gaston Leval argued, *"the State, by its nature,
tends to have a life of its own."* [quoted by Sam Dolgoff, **A Critique
of Marxism**, p. 10]

Marx's *"implicit theory of the state - a theory which, in reducing
political power to the realisation of the interests of the dominant
economic classes, precludes any concern with the potentially
authoritarian and oppressive outcome of authoritarian and centralised
revolutionary methods . . . This danger (namely, the dismissal of
warranted fears concerning political power) is latent in the central
features of Marx's approach to politics."* [Alan Carter, **Op. Cit.**,
p. 219] To summarise the obvious conclusion:

> *"By focusing too much attention on the economic structure of society
> and insufficient attention on the problems of political power, Marx
> has left a legacy we would done better not to inherit. The perceived
> need for authoritarian and centralised revolutionary organisation is
> sanctioned by Marx's theory because his theoretical subordination of
> political power to economic classes apparently renders
> post-revolutionary political power unproblematic."* [**Op. Cit.**, p.
> 231]

Many factors contributed to Stalinism, including Marxism's defective
theory of the state. In stressing that socialism meant nationalising
property, it lead to state management which, in turn, expropriated the
working class as a vast managerial bureaucracy was required to run it.
Moreover, Marxism disguised this new ruling class as it argues that the
state 'represents' a class and had no interests of itself. Thus we have
Trotsky's utter inability to understand Stalinism and his insane formula
that the proletariat remained the ruling class under Stalin (or, for
that matter, under himself and Lenin)! Simply put, by arguing that the
state was an instrument of class rule, Marxism ensured it presented a
false theory of social change and could not analysis its resulting class
rule when the inevitable consequences of this approach was implemented.

However, there is more to Marxism than its dominant theory of the state.
Given this blindness of orthodox Marxism to this issue, it seems ironic
that one of the people responsible for it also provides anarchists with
evidence to back up our argument that the state is not simply an
instrument of class rule but rather has interests of its own. Thus we
find Engels arguing that proletariat, *"in order not to lose again its
only just conquered supremacy,"* would have *"to safeguard itself
against its own deputies and officials, by declaring them all, without
exception, subject to recall at any moment."* [**Selected Works**, p.
257] Yet, if the state was simply an instrument of class rule such
precautions would not be necessary. Engels comments show an awareness
that the state can have interests of its own, that it is not simply a
machine of class rule.

Aware of the obvious contradiction, Engels argued that the state *"is,
as a rule, the state of the most powerful, economically dominant class
which, through the medium of the state, becomes the politically dominant
class . . . By way of exception, however, periods occur in which the
warring classes balance each other, so nearly that the state power, as
ostensible mediator, acquires, for the moment, a certain degree of
independence of both."* He pointed to the *"absolute monarchy of the
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries"*, which held the balance between
the nobility and the bourgeoisie against one another as well as *"the
Bonapartism of the First, and still more of the Second French Empire."*
It should be noted that, elsewhere, Engels was more precise on how long
the state was, in fact, controlled by the bourgeoisie, namely two years:
*"In France, where the bourgeoisie as such, as a class in its entirety,
held power for only two years, 1849 and 1850, under the republic, it was
able to continue its social existence only by abdicating its political
power to Louis Bonaparte and the army."* [**Op. Cit.**, pp. 577-8 and p.
238] So, in terms of French history, Engels argued that *"by way of
exception"* accounted for over 250 hundred years, the 17th and 18th
centuries and most of the 19th, bar a two year period! Even if we are
generous and argue that the 1830 revolution placed one section of the
bourgeoisie (finance capital) into political power, we are still left
with over 200 hundred years of state "independence" from classes! Given
this, it would be fair to suggest that the "exception" should be when it
**is** an instrument of class rule, not when it is not!

This was no isolated case. In Prussia *"members of the bourgeoisie have
a majority in the Chamber . . . But where is their power over the state?
. . . the mass of the bourgeoisie . . . does not **want** to rule."*
[**Op. Cit.**, pp. 236-7] And so, in Germany, there exists *"alongside
the basic condition of the old absolute monarchy - an equilibrium
between the landowner aristocracy and the bourgeoisie - the basic
condition of modern Bonapartism - an equilibrium between the bourgeoisie
and the proletariat."* This meant that *"both in the old absolute
monarchy and in the modern Bonapartist monarchy the real government
power lies in the hands of a special caste of army officers and state
officials"* and so the *"independence of this case, which appears to
occupy a position outside and, so to speak, above society, gives the
state the semblance of independence in relation to society."* However,
this did not stop Engels asserting that the *"state is nothing but the
organised collective power of the exploiting classes, the landlords and
the capitalists as against the exploited classes, the peasants and the
workers. What the individual capitalists . . . do not want, their state
also does not want."* [**Collected Works**, vol. 23, p. 363 and p. 362]

So, according to Engels, the executive of the state, like the state
itself, can become independent from classes if the opposing classes were
balanced. This analysis, it must be pointed out, was an improvement on
the earliest assertions of Marx and Engels on the state. In the 1840s,
it was a case of the *"independence of the state is only found nowadays
in those countries where the estates have not yet completely developed
into classes . . . where consequently no section of the population can
achieve dominance over the others."* [**Op. Cit.**, vol. 5, p. 90] For
Engels, *"[f]rom the moment the state administration and legislature
fall under the control of the bourgeoisie, the independence of the
bureaucracy ceases to exist."* [**Op. Cit.**, vol. 6, p. 88] It must,
therefore, have come as a surprise for Marx and Engels when the state
and its bureaucracy appeared to become independent in France under
Napoleon III.

Talking of which, it should be noted that, initially for Marx, under
Bonapartism *"the state power is not suspended in mid air. Bonaparte
represents a class, and the most numerous class of French society at
that, the **small-holding [Parzellen] peasants**."* The Bonaparte *"who
dispersed the bourgeois parliament is the chosen of the peasantry."*
However, this class is *"incapable of enforcing their class interests in
their own name . . . They cannot represent themselves, they must be
represented. Their representative must at the same time appear as their
master, as an authority over them, as an unlimited governmental power .
. . The political influence of the small-holding peasants, therefore,
finds its final expression in the executive power subordinating society
to itself."* Yet Marx himself admits that this regime experienced
*"peasant risings in half of France"*, organised *"raids on the peasants
by the army"* and the *"mass incarceration and transportation of
peasants."* A strange form of class rule, when the class represented is
oppressed by the regime! Rest assured, though, the *"Bonaparte dynasty
represents not the revolutionary, but the conservative peasant."* Then
Marx, without comment, pronounced Bonaparte to be *"the representative
of the **lumpenproletariat** to which he himself, his entourage, his
government and his army belong."* [**Selected Works**, p. 170, p. 171
and p. 176]

It would be fair to say that Marx's analysis is somewhat confused and
seems an ad hoc explanation to the fact that in a modern society the
state appeared to become independent of the economically dominant class.
Yet if a regime is systematically oppressing a class then it is fair to
conclude that is **not** representing that class in any way. Bonaparte's
power did not, in other words, rest on the peasantry. Rather, like
fascism, it was a means by which the bourgeoisie could break the power
of the working class and secure its own class position against possible
social revolution. As Bakunin argued, it was a *"despotic imperial
system"* which the bourgeois *"themselves founded out of fear of the
Social Revolution."* [**The Basic Bakunin**, p. 63] Thus the abolition
of bourgeois rule was more apparent than real:

> *"As soon as the people took equality and liberty seriously, the
> bourgeoisie . . . retreated into reaction . . . They began by
> suppressing universal suffrage . . . The fear of Social Revolution . .
> . . hurled this downfallen class . . . into the arms of the
> dictatorship of Napoleon III . . . We should not think that the
> Bourgeois Gentlemen were too inconvenienced . . . [Those who] applied
> themselves earnestly and exclusively to the great concern of the
> bourgeoisie, the exploitation of the people . . . were well protected
> and powerfully supported . . . All went well, according to the desires
> of the bourgeoisie."* [**Op. Cit.**, pp. 62-3]

Somewhat ironically, then, a key example used by Marxists for the
"independence" of the state is no such thing. Bonapartism did not
represent a "balance" between the proletariat and bourgeoisie but rather
the most naked form of state rule required in the fact of working class
revolt. It was a counter-revolutionary regime which reflected a defeat
for the working class, not a "balance" between it and the capitalist
class.

Marx's confusions arose from his belief that, for the bourgeoisie, the
parliamentary republic *"was the unavoidable condition of their
**common** rule, the sole form of state in which their general class
interest subjected itself at the same time both the claims of their
particular factions and all the remaining classes of society."*
[**Selected Works**, pp. 152-3] The abolition of the republic, the
replacement of the government, was, for him, the end of the political
rule of the bourgeoisie as he argued that *"the industrial bourgeoisie
applauds with servile bravos the **coup d’état** of December 2, the
annihilation of parliament, the downfall of its own rule, the
dictatorship of Bonaparte."* He repeated this identification: *"Passing
of the parliamentary regime and of bourgeois rule. Victory of
Bonaparte."* [**Selected Writings**, pp. 164-5 and p. 166] Political
rule was equated to which party held power and so, logically, universal
suffrage was *"the equivalent of political power for the working class .
. . where the proletariat forms the large majority of the population."*
Its *"inevitable result* would be *"**the political supremacy of the
working class**."* [**Collected Works**, vol. 11, pp. 335-6] This was,
of course, simply wrong (on both counts) as he, himself, seemed to
became aware of two decades later.

In 1871 he argued that *"the State power assumed more and more the
character of the national power of capital over labour, of a public
force organised for social enslavement, of an engine of class
despotism."* This meant that *"in view of the threatened upheaval of the
proletariat, [the bourgeoisie] now used that State power mercilessly and
ostentatiously as the national war-engine of capital against labour"*
and so were *"bound not only to invest the executive with continually
increased powers of repression, but at the same time to divest their own
parliamentary stronghold . . . of all its own means of defence against
the Executive. The Executive, in the person of Louis Bonaparte, turned
them out."* Marx now admitted that this regime only *"professed to rest
upon the peasantry"* while, *"[i]n reality, it was the only form of
government possible at a time when the bourgeoisie had already lost, and
the working class had not yet acquired, the faculty of ruling the
nation."* However, *"[u]nder its sway, bourgeois society, freed from
political cares, attained a development unexpected even by itself."*
[**Selected Works**, p. 285, p. 286, pp. 286-7 and p. 287]

Yet capitalists often do well under regimes which suppress the basic
liberties of the working class and so the bourgeoisie remained the
ruling class and the state remained its organ. In other words, there is
no "balance" between classes under Bonapartism even if the political
regime is not subject to electoral control by the bourgeoisie and has
more independence to pursue its own agenda.

This is not the only confirmation of the anarchist critique of the
Marxist theory of the state which can be found in Marxism itself. Marx,
at times, also admitted the possibility of the state **not** being an
instrument of (economic) class rule. For example, he mentioned the
so-called ***"Asiatic Mode of Production"*** in which *"there are no
private landowners"* but rather *"the state . . . which confronts"* the
peasants *"directly as simultaneously landowner and sovereign, rent and
tax coincide . . . Here the state is the supreme landlord. Sovereignty
here is landed property concentrated on a national scale."*
[**Capital**, vol. 3, p. 927] Thus *"the State [is] the real landlord"*
in the *"Asiatic system"* [**Collected Works**, vol. 12, p. 215] In
other words, the ruling class could be a state bureaucracy and so be
independent of economic classes. Unfortunately this analysis remained
woefully undeveloped and no conclusions were drawn from these few
comments, perhaps unsurprisingly as it undermines the claim that the
state is merely the instrument of the economically dominant class. It
also, of course, has applicability to state socialism and certain
conclusions could be reached that suggested it, as Bakunin warned, would
be a new form of class rule.

The state bureaucracy as the ruling class can be seen in Soviet Russia
(and the other so-called "socialist" regimes such as China and Cuba). As
libertarian socialist Ante Ciliga put it, *"the manner in which Lenin
organised industry had handed it over entirely into the hands of the
bureaucracy,"* and so the workers *"became once more the wage-earning
manpower in other people's factories. Of socialism there remained in
Russia no more than the word."* [**The Russian Enigma**, p. 280 and p.
286] Capitalism became state capitalism under Lenin and Trotsky and so
the state, as Bakunin predicted and feared, became the new ruling class
under Marxism (see [section H.3.14](secH3.html#sech314) for more
discussion of this).

The confusions of the Marxist theory of the state ensured that Trotsky,
for example, failed to recognise the obvious, namely that the Stalinist
state bureaucracy was a ruling class. Rather, it was the *"new ruling
caste"*, or *"the ruling stratum"*. While admitting, at one stage, that
the *"transfer of the factories to the State changed the situation of
the workers only juridically"* Trotsky then ignored the obvious
conclusion that this has left the working class as an exploited class
under a (new) form of capitalism to assert that the *"nature"* of
Stalinist Russia was *"a proletarian State"* because of its
*"nationalisation"* of the means of life (which *"constitute the basis
of the Soviet social structure"*). He admitted that the *"Soviet
Bureaucracy has expropriated the proletariat politically"* but has done
so *"in order by methods of **its own** to defend the social conquests"*
of the October Revolution. He did not ponder too deeply the implications
of admitting that the *"means of production belong to the State. But the
State, so to speak, 'belongs' to the bureaucracy."* [**The Revolution
Betrayed**, p. 93, p. 136, p. 228, p. 235 and p. 236] If that is so,
only ideology can stop the obvious confusion being drawn, namely that
the state bureaucracy was the ruling class. But that is precisely what
happened with Trotsky's confusion expressing itself thusly:

> *"In no other regime has a bureaucracy ever achieved such a degree of
> independence from the dominating class . . . it is something more than
> a bureaucracy. It is in the full sense of the word the sole privileged
> and commanding stratum in the Soviet society."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 235]

By this, Trotsky suggested that the working class was the *"dominating
class"* under Stalinism! In fact, the bureaucracy *"continues to
preserve State property only to the extent it fears the proletariat"*
while, at the same time, the bureaucracy has *"become [society's] lord"*
and *"the Soviet state has acquired a totalitarian-bureaucratic
character"*! This nonsense is understandable, given the unwillingness to
draw the obvious conclusion from the fact that the bureaucracy was
*"compelled to defend State property as the source of its power and its
income. In this aspect of its activity it still remains a weapon of
proletarian dictatorship."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 112, p. 107, p. 238 and p.
236] By commanding nationalised property, the bureaucracy, like private
capitalists, could exploit the labour of the working class and did. That
the state owned the means of production did not stop this being a form
of class system.

It is simply nonsense to claim, as Trotsky did, that the *"anatomy of
society is determined by its economic relations. So long as the forms of
property that have been created by the October Revolution are not
overthrown, the proletariat remains the ruling class."* [**Writings of
Leon Trotsky 1933-34**, p. 125] How could the proletariat be the
*"ruling class"* if it were under the heel of a totalitarian
dictatorship? State ownership of property was precisely the means by
which the bureaucracy enforced its control over production and so the
source of its economic power and privileges. To state the obvious, if
the working class does not control the property it is claimed to own
then someone else does. The economic relationship thus generated is a
hierarchical one, in which the working class is an oppressed class.

Significantly, Trotsky combated those of his followers who drew the same
conclusions as had anarchists and libertarian Marxists while he and
Lenin held the reigns of power. Perhaps this ideological blindness is
understandable, given Trotsky's key role in creating the bureaucracy in
the first place. So Trotsky did criticise, if in a confused manner, the
Stalinist regime for its *"injustice, oppression, differential
consumption, and so on, even if he had supported them when he himself
was in the elite."* [Neil C. Fernandez, **Capitalism and Class Struggle
in the USSR**, p. 180]). Then there is the awkward conclusion that if
the bureaucracy were a ruling class under Stalin then Russia was also
state capitalist under Lenin and Trotsky for the economic relations were
identical in both (this obvious conclusion haunts those, like the
British SWP, who maintain that Stalinism was State Capitalist but not
Bolshevism - see [section H.3.13](secH3.html#sech313)). Suffice to say,
if the state itself can be the "economically dominant class" then the
state cannot be a mere instrument of an economic class.

Moreover, Engels also presented another analysis of the state which
suggested that it arose **before** economic classes appeared. In 1886 he
wrote of how society *"creates for itself an organ for the safeguarding
of its common interests against internal and external attacks. This
organ is the state power. Hardly come into being, this organ makes
itself independent **vis-à-vis** society: and, indeed, the more so, the
more it becomes the organ of a particular class, the more it directly
enforces the supremacy of that class."* *"Society",* he argued four
years later, *"gives rise to certain common function which it cannot
dispense with. The persons appointed for this purpose form a new branch
of the division of labour **within society**. This gives them particular
interests, distinct, too, from the interests of those who empowered
them; they make themselves independent of the latter and - the state is
in being."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 617 and pp. 685-6] In this schema, the
independence of the state comes **first** and is then captured by rising
economically powerful class.

Regardless of when and how the state arises, the key thing is that
Engels recognised that the state was *"endowed with relative
independence."* Rather than being a simple expression of economic
classes and their interests, this *"new independent power, while having
in the main to follow the movement of production, reacts in its turn, by
virtue of its inherent relative independence - that is, the relative
independence once transferred to it and gradually further developed -
upon the conditions and course of production. It is the interaction of
two unequal forces: on the one hand, the economic movement, on the
other, the new political power, which strives for as much independence
as possible, and which, having once been established, is endowed with a
movement of its own."* There were three types of *"reaction of the state
power upon economic development."* The state can act *"in the same
direction"* and then it is *"more rapid"* or it can *"oppose"* it and
*"can do great damage to the economic development."* Finally, it can
*"prevent the economic development proceeding along certain lines, and
prescribe other lines."* Finally he stated *"why do we fight for the
political dictatorship of the proletariat if political power is
economically impotent? Force (that is, state power) is also an economic
power!"* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 686 and p. 689]

Conversely, anarchists reply, why fight for *"the political dictatorship
of the proletariat"* when you yourself admit that the state can become
*"independent"* of the classes you claim it represents? Particularly
when you **increase** its potential for becoming independent by
centralising it even more and giving it economic powers to complement
its political ones!

So the Marxist theory of the state is that is an instrument of class
rule - except when it is not. Its origins lie in the rise of class
antagonisms - except when it does not. It arises after the break up of
society into classes - except when it does not. Which means, of course,
the state is **not** just an instrument of class rule and,
correspondingly, the anarchist critique is confirmed. This explains why
the analysis of the *"Asiatic Mode of Production"* is so woefully
underdeveloped in Marx and Engels as well as the confused and
contradictory attempt to understand Bonapartism.

To summarise, if the state can become *"independent"* of economic
classes or even exist without an economically dominant class, then that
implies that it is no mere machine, no mere *"instrument"* of class
rule. It implies the anarchist argument that the state has interests of
its own, generated by its essential features and so, therefore, cannot
be used by a majority class as part of its struggle for liberation is
correct. Simply put, Anarchists have long *"realised - feared - that any
State structure, whether or not socialist or based on universal
suffrage, has a certain independence from society, and so may serve the
interests of those within State institutions rather than the people as a
whole or the proletariat."* [Brian Morris, **Bakunin: The Philosophy of
Freedom**, p. 134] Thus *"the state certainly has interests of its own .
. . [,] acts to protect [them] . . . and protects the interests of the
bourgeoisie when these interests happen to coincide with its own, as,
indeed, they usually do."* [Carter, **Op. Cit.**, p. 226]

As Mark Leier quips, Marxism *"has usually - save when battling
anarchists - argued that the state has some 'relative autonomy' and is
not a direct, simple reflex of a given economic system."* [**Bakunin:
The Constructive Passion**, p. 275] The reason why the more
sophisticated Marxist analysis of the state is forgotten when it comes
to attacking anarchism should be obvious - it undermines the both the
Marxist critique of anarchism and its own theory of the state.
Ironically, arguments and warnings about the *"independence"* of the
state by Marxists imply that the state has interests of its own and
cannot be considered simply as an instrument of class rule. They suggest
that the anarchist analysis of the state is correct, namely that any
structure based on delegated power, centralisation and hierarchy must,
inevitably, have a privileged class in charge of it, a class whose
position enables it to not only exploit and oppress the rest of society
but also to effectively escape from popular control and accountability.
This is no accident. The state is structured to enforce minority rule
and exclude the majority.

H.3.10 Has Marxism always supported the idea of workers' councils?
------------------------------------------------------------------

One of the most widespread myths associated with Marxism is the idea
that Marxism has consistently aimed to smash the current (bourgeois)
state and replace it by a *"workers' state"* based on working class
organisations created during a revolution.

This myth is sometimes expressed by those who should know better (i.e.
Marxists). According to John Rees (of the British Socialist Workers
Party) it has been a *"cornerstone of revolutionary theory"* that *"the
soviet is a superior form of democracy because it unifies political and
economic power."* This *"cornerstone"* has, apparently, existed *"since
Marx's writings on the Paris Commune."* [*"In Defence of October,"*, pp.
3-82, **International Socialism**, no. 52, p. 25] In fact, nothing could
be further from the truth, as Marx's writings on the Paris Commune prove
beyond doubt.

The Paris Commune, as Marx himself noted, was *"formed of the municipal
councillors, chosen by universal suffrage in the various wards of the
town."* [**Selected Works**, p. 287] As Marx made clear, it was
definitely **not** based on delegates from workplaces and so could
**not** unify political and economic power. Indeed, to state that the
Paris Commune was a soviet is simply a joke, as is the claim that
Marxists supported soviets as revolutionary organs to smash and replace
the state from 1871. In fact Marxists did not subscribe to this
*"cornerstone of revolutionary theory"* until 1917 when Lenin argued
that the Soviets would be the best means of ensuring a Bolshevik
government. Which explains why Lenin's use of the slogan *"All Power to
the Soviets"* and call for the destruction of the bourgeois state came
as such a shock to his fellow Marxists. Unsurprisingly, given the long
legacy of anarchist calls to smash the state and their vision of a
socialist society built from below by workers councils, many Marxists
called Lenin an anarchist! Therefore, the idea that Marxists have always
supported workers councils' is untrue and any attempt to push this
support back to 1871 simply a farcical.

Not all Marxists are as ignorant of their political tradition as Rees.
As his fellow party member Chris Harman recognised, *"[e]ven the 1905
[Russian] revolution gave only the most embryonic expression of how a
workers' state would in fact be organised. The fundamental forms of
workers' power - the soviets (workers' councils) - were not
recognised."* It was *"[n]ot until the February revolution [of 1917
that] soviets became central in Lenin's writings and thought."* [**Party
and Class**, p. 18 and p. 19] Before then, Marxists had held the
position, to quote Karl Kautsky from 1909 (who is, in turn, quoting his
own words from 1893), that the democratic republic *"was the particular
form of government in which alone socialism can be realised."* He added,
after the Russian Revolution, that *"not a single Marxist revolutionary
repudiated me, neither Rosa Luxemburg nor Klara Zetkin, neither Lenin
nor Trotsky."* [**The Road to Power**, p. 34 and p. xlviii]

Lenin himself, even after Social Democracy supported their respective
states in the First World War and before his return to Russia, still
argued that Kautsky's work contained *"a most complete exposition of the
tasks of our times"* and *"it was most advantageous to the German
Social-Democrats (in the sense of the promise they held out), and
moreover came from the pen of the most eminent writer of the Second
International . . . Social-Democracy . . . wants conquest of political
power by the proletariat, the dictatorship of the proletariat."*
[**Collected Works**, vol. 21, p. 94] There was no hint that Marxism
stood for anything other than seizing power in a republic, as expounded
by the likes of Kautsky.

Before continuing it should be stressed that Harman's summary is correct
only if we are talking about the Marxist movement. Looking at the wider
revolutionary movement, two groups definitely recognised the importance
of the soviets as a form of working class power and as the framework of
a socialist society. These were the anarchists and the
Social-Revolutionary Maximalists, both of whom *"espoused views that
corresponded almost word for word with Lenin's April 1917 program of
'All power to the soviets.'"* The *"aims of the revolutionary far left
in 1905"* Lenin *"combined in his call for soviet power [in 1917], when
he apparently assimilated the anarchist program to secure the support of
the masses for the Bolsheviks."* [Oskar Anweiler, **The Soviets**, p. 94
and p. 96]

So before 1917, when Lenin claimed to have discovered what had eluded
all the previous followers of Marx and Engels (including himself!), it
was only anarchists (or those close to them such as the SR-Maximalists)
who argued that the future socialist society would be structurally based
around the organs working class people themselves created in the process
of the class struggle and revolution. For example, the syndicalists
*"regarded the soviets . . . as admirable versions of the **bourses du
travail**, but with a revolutionary function added to suit Russian
conditions. Open to all leftist workers regardless of specific political
affiliation, the soviets were to act as nonpartisan labour councils
improvised 'from below' . . . with the aim of bringing down the old
regime."* The anarchists of **Khleb i Volia** *"also likened the 1905
Petersburg Soviet - as a non-party mass organisation - to the central
committee of the Paris Commune of 1871."* [Paul Avrich, **The Russian
Anarchists**, pp. 80-1] In 1907, it was concluded that the revolution
required *"the proclamation in villages and towns of workers' communes
with soviets of workers' deputies . . . at their head."* [quoted by
Alexandre Skirda, **Facing the Enemy**, p. 77] These ideas can be traced
back to Bakunin, so, ironically, the idea of the superiority of workers'
councils **has** existed from around the time of the Paris Commune, but
only in anarchist theory.

So, if Marxists did not support workers' councils until 1917, what
**did** Marxists argue should be the framework of a socialist society
before this date? To discover this, we must look to Marx and Engels.
Once we do, we discover that their works suggest that their vision of
socialist transformation was fundamentally based on the bourgeois state,
suitably modified and democratised to achieve this task. As such, rather
than present the true account of the Marxist theory of the state Lenin
interpreted various inexact and ambiguous statements by Marx and Engels
(particularly from Marx's defence of the Paris Commune) to justify his
own actions in 1917. Whether his 1917 revision of Marxism in favour of
workers' councils as the means to socialism is in keeping with the
**spirit** of Marx is another matter of course. For the **Socialist
Party of Great Britain** and its sister parties, Lenin violated both the
letter **and** the spirit of Marx and they stress his arguments in
favour of utilising universal suffrage to introduce socialism (indeed,
their analysis of Marx and critique of Lenin is substantially the same
as the one presented here). For the council communists, who embraced the
idea of workers' councils but broke with the Bolsheviks over the issue
of whether the councils or the party had power, Lenin's analysis, while
flawed in parts, is in the general spirit of Marx and they stress the
need to smash the state and replace it with workers' councils. In this,
they express the best in Marx. When faced with the Paris Commune and its
libertarian influences he embraced it, distancing himself (for a while
at least) with many of his previous ideas.

So what was the original (orthodox) Marxist position? It can be seen
from Lenin who, as late December 1916 argued that *"Socialists are in
favour of utilising the present state and its institutions in the
struggle for the emancipation of the working class, maintaining also
that the state should be used for a specific form of transition from
capitalism to socialism."* Lenin attacked Bukharin for *"erroneously
ascribing this [the anarchist] view to the socialist"* when he had
stated socialists wanted to *"abolish"* the state or *"blow it up."* He
called this *"transitional form"* the dictatorship of the proletariat,
*"which is **also** a state."* [**Collected Works**, vol. 23, p. 165] In
other words, the socialist party would aim to seize power within the
existing republican state and, after making suitable modifications to
it, use it to create socialism.

That this position was the orthodox one is hardly surprising, given the
actual comments of both Marx and Engels. For example Engels argued in
April 1883 while he and Marx saw *"the gradual dissolution and ultimate
disappearance of that political organisation called **the State**"* as
*"**one** of the final results of the future revolution,"* they *"at the
same time . . . have always held that . . . the proletarian class will
first have to possess itself of the organised political force of the
State and with its aid stamp out the resistance of the Capitalist class
and re-organise society."* The idea that the proletariat needs to
*"possess"* the existing state is made clear when he notes that the
anarchists *"reverse the matter"* by advocating that the revolution
*"has to **begin** by abolishing the political organisation of the
State."* For Marxists *"the only organisation the victorious working
class finds **ready-made** for use, is that of the State. It may require
adaptation to the new functions. But to destroy that at such a moment,
would be to destroy the only organism by means of which the working
class can exert its newly conquered power."* [our emphasis, **Op.
Cit.**, vol. 47, p. 10]

Obviously the only institution which the working class *"finds
ready-made for use"* is the democratic (i.e., bourgeois) state,
although, as Engels stressed, it *"may require adaptation."* In Engels'
1871 introduction to Marx's *"The Civil War in France"*, this analysis
is repeated when Engels asserted that the state *"is nothing but a
machine for the oppression of one class by another"* and that it is *"at
best an evil inherited by the proletariat after its victorious struggle
for class supremacy, whose worst sides the victorious proletariat, just
like the Commune, cannot avoid having to lop off at once as much as
possible."* [**Selected Works**, p. 258]

If the proletariat creates a **new** state to replace the bourgeois one,
then how can it be *"ready-made for use"* and *"an evil inherited"* by
it? If, as Lenin argued, Marx and Engels thought that the working class
had to smash the bourgeois state and replace it with a new one, why
would it have *"to lop off at once as much as possible"* from the state
it had just *"inherited"*?

Three years later, Engels made his position clear: *"With respect to the
proletariat the republic differs from the monarchy only in that it is
the **ready-for-use** form for the future rule of the proletariat."* He
went on to state that the French socialists *"are at an advantage
compared to us in already having it"* and warned against *"baseless"*
illusions such as seeking to *"entrust socialist tasks to it while it is
dominated by the bourgeoisie."* [Marx and Engels, **The Socialist
Revolution**, p. 296] This was, significantly, simply repeating Engels
1891 argument from his critique of the draft of the Erfurt program of
the German Social Democrats:

> *"If one thing is certain it is that our Party and the working class
> can only come to power under the form of a democratic republic. This
> is even the specific form for the dictatorship of the proletariat, as
> the Great French Revolution has already shown."* [**Collected Works**,
> vol. 27, p. 227]

Clearly Engels does not speak of a "commune-republic" or anything close
to a soviet republic, as expressed in Bakunin's work or the libertarian
wing of the First International with their ideas of a "trade-union
republic" or a free federation of workers' associations. Clearly and
explicitly he speaks of the democratic republic, the current state (*"an
evil inherited by the proletariat"*) which is to be seized and
transformed.

Unsurprisingly, when Lenin came to quote this passage in **State and
Revolution** he immediately tried to obscure its meaning. *"Engels,"* he
wrote, *"repeated here in a particularly striking form the fundamental
idea which runs through all of Marx's work, namely, that the democratic
republic is the nearest approach to the dictatorship of the
proletariat."* [**The Lenin Anthology**, p. 360] However, obviously
Engels did nothing of the kind. He did not speak of the political form
which *"is the nearest approach"* to the dictatorship, rather he wrote
only of *"the specific form"* of the dictatorship, the *"only"* form in
which *"our Party"* can come to power. Hal Draper, likewise, denied that
Engels meant what he clearly wrote, arguing that he **really** meant the
Paris Commune. *"Because of the expression 'great French revolution,'"*
Draper asserted, *"the assumption has often been made that Engels meant
the French Revolution of 1789; but the idea that he, or anyone else,
could view 1789 (or 1793) as a 'dictatorship of the proletariat' is too
absurd to entertain."* [**The 'dictatorship of the proletariat' from
Marx to Lenin**, p. 37fn]

Yet, contextually, no evidence exists to support such a claim and what
does disputes it - Engels discusses French history and makes no mention
of the Commune but **does** mention the republic of 1792 to 1799
(significantly, Lenin makes no attempt to suggest that Engels meant the
Paris Commune or anything else bar a democratic republic). In fact,
Engels goes on to argue that *"[f]rom 1792 to 1799 each French
department, each commune, enjoyed complete self-government on the
American model, and this is what we too must have. How self-government
is to be organised and how we can manage without a bureaucracy has been
shown to us by America and the first French Republic."* Significantly,
Engels was explicitly discussing the need for a *"republican party
programme"*, commenting that it would be impossible for *"our best
people to become ministers"* under an Emperor and arguing that, in
Germany at the time, they could not call for a republic and had to raise
the *"demand for **the concentration of all political power in the hands
of the people's representatives**."* Engels stressed that *"the
proletariat can only use the form of the one and indivisible republic"*
with *"self-government"* meaning *"officials elected by universal
suffrage"*. [**Op. Cit.**, pp. 227-9]

Clearly, the *"assumption"* Draper denounced makes more sense than his
own or Lenin's. This is particularly the case when it is clear that both
Marx and Engels viewed the French Republic under the Jacobins as a
situation where the proletariat held political power (although, like
Marx with the Paris Commune, they do not use the term "dictatorship of
the proletariat" to describe it). Engels wrote of *"the rule of the
Mountain party"* as being *"the short time when the proletariat was at
the helm of the state in the French Revolution"* and *"from May 31, 1793
to July 26, 1794 . . . not a single bourgeois dared show his face in the
whole of France."* Marx, similarly, wrote of this period as one in which
*"the proletariat overthrows the political rule of the bourgeoisie"* but
due to the *"material conditions"* its acts were *"in service"* of the
bourgeois revolution. The *"bloody action of the people"* only
*"prepared the way for"* the bourgeoisie by destroying feudalism,
something which the bourgeoisie was not capable of. [**Op. Cit.**, vol.
6, p. 373, p. 5 and p. 319]

Apparently Engels did **not** consider it *"too absurd to entertain"*
that the French Republic of 1793 was *"a 'dictatorship of the
proletariat'"* and, ironically, Draper's *"anyone else"* turned out to
be Marx! Moreover, this was well known in Marxist circles long before
Draper made his assertion. Julius Martov (for example) after quoting
Marx on this issue summarised that, for Marx and Engels, the *"Reign of
Terror in France was the momentary domination of the democratic petty
bourgeoisie and the proletariat over all the possessing classes,
including the authentic bourgeoisie."* [**The State and Socialist
Revolution**, p. 51]

Similarly, Lenin quoted Engels on the proletariat seizing *"state
power"* and nationalising the means of production, an act by which it
*"abolishes itself as proletariat"* **and** *"abolishes the state as
state."* Significantly, it is **Lenin** who has to write that *"Engels
speaks here of the proletarian revolution 'abolishing' the **bourgeois**
state, while the words about the state withering away refer to the
remnants of the **proletariat** state **after** the socialist
revolution."* Yet Engels himself makes no such differentiation and talks
purely of *"the state"* and it *"becom[ing] the real representative of
the whole of society"* by *"taking possession of the means of production
in the name of society."* Perhaps Lenin was right and Engels really
meant two different states but, sadly, he failed to make that point
explicitly, so allowing Marxism, to use Lenin's words, to be subjected
to *"the crudest distortion"* by its followers, *"prune[d]"* and
*"reduc[ed] . . . to opportunism."* [**Op. Cit.**, pp. 320-2]

Then there are Engels 1887 comments that in the USA the workers *"next
step towards their deliverance"* was *"the formation of a political
workingmen's party, with a platform of its own, and the conquest of the
Capitol and the White House for its goal."* This new party *"like all
political parties everywhere . . . aspires to the conquest of political
power."* Engels then discusses the *"electoral battle"* going on in
America. [Marx and Engels, **Collected Works**, vol. 26, p. 435 and p.
437] Significantly, 40 years previously in 1847, Engels had argued that
the revolution *"will establish a **democratic constitution**, and
through this, the direct . . . dominance of the proletariat"* where
*"the proletarians are already a majority of the people."* He noted that
*"a democratic constitution has been introduced"* in America. [**Op.
Cit.**, vol. 6, p. 350 and p. 356] The continuity is significant,
particularly as these identical arguments come before and after the
Paris Commune of 1871.

This was no isolated statement. Engels had argued along the same lines
(and, likewise, echoed early statements) as regards Britain in 1881,
*"where the industrial and agricultural working class forms the immense
majority of the people, democracy means the dominion of the working
class, neither more nor less. Let, then, that working class prepare
itself for the task in store for it - the ruling of this great Empire .
. . And the best way to do this is to use the power already in their
hands, the actual majority they possess . . . to send to Parliament men
of their own order."* In case this was not clear enough, he lamented
that *"[e]verywhere the labourer struggles for political power, for
direct representation of his class in the legislature - everywhere but
in Great Britain."* [**Op. Cit.**, vol. 24, p. 405] For Engels:

> *"In every struggle of class against class, the next end fought for is
> political power; the ruling class defends its political supremacy,
> that is to say its safe majority in the Legislature; the inferior
> class fights for, first a share, then the whole of that power, in
> order to become enabled to change existing laws in conformity with
> their own interests and requirements. Thus the working class of Great
> Britain for years fought ardently and even violently for the People's
> Charter [which demanded universal suffrage and yearly general
> elections], which was to give it that political power."* [**Op.
> Cit.**, p. 386]

The 1st of May, 1893, saw Engels argue that the task of the British
working class was not only to pursue economic struggles *"but above all
in winning political rights, parliament, through the working class
organised into an independent party"* (significantly, the original
manuscript stated *"but in winning parliament, the political power"*).
He went on to state that the 1892 general election saw the workers give
a *"taste of their power, hitherto unexerted."* [**Op. Cit.**, vol. 27,
p. 395] This, significantly, is in line with his 1870 comment that in
Britain *"the bourgeoisie could only get its real representative . . .
into government only by extension of the franchise, whose consequences
are bound to put an end to all bourgeois rule."* [**Selected Works**, p.
238]

Marx seems to see voting for a government as being the same as political
power as the *"fundamental contradiction"* of a democracy under
capitalism is that the classes *"whose social slavery the constitution
is to perpetuate"* it *"puts in possession of political power through
universal suffrage."* [**Collected Works**, vol. 10, p. 79] For Engels
in 1847, *"democracy has as its necessary consequence the political rule
of the proletariat."* Universal suffrage would *"make political power
pass from the middle class to the working class"* and so *"the
democratic movement"* is *"striving for the political domination of the
proletariat."* [**Op. Cit.**, vol. 7, p. 299, p. 440 and p. 368] As
noted in [section H.3.9](secH3.html#sech39), Marx concluded that
Bonaparte's coup ended the political power of the bourgeoisie and, for
Engels, *"the whole bourgeoisie ruled, but for three years only"* during
the Second French Republic of 1848-51. Significantly, during the
previous regime of Louis-Philippe (1830-48) *"a very small portion of
the bourgeois ruled the kingdom"* as *"by far the larger part were
excluded from the suffrage by high [property] qualifications."* [**Op.
Cit.**, vol. 27, p. 297]

All of which, of course, fits into Marx's account of the Paris Commune
where, as noted above, the Commune *"was formed of the municipal
councillors"* who had been *"chosen by universal suffrage in the various
wards of the town"* in the municipal elections held on March 26th, 1871.
Once voted into office, the Commune then smashed the state machine
inherited by it, recognising that *"the working class cannot simply lay
hold of the ready-made state machinery, and wield it for its own
purposes."* The *"first decree of the Commune . . . was the suppression
of the standing army, and the substitution for it of the armed people."*
Thus the Commune lops off one of the *"ubiquitous organs"* associated
with the *"centralised State power"* once it had inherited the state via
elections. [**Selected Works**, p. 287, p. 285, p. 287 and p. 285]
Indeed, this is precisely what **was** meant, as confirmed by Engels in
a letter written in 1884 clarifying what Marx meant:

> *"It is simply a question of showing that the victorious proletariat
> must first refashion the old bureaucratic, administrative centralised
> state power before it can use it for its own purposes: whereas all
> bourgeois republicans since 1848 inveighed against this machinery so
> long as they were in the opposition, but once they were in the
> government they took it over without altering it and used it partly
> against the reaction but still more against the proletariat."*
> [**Collected Works**, vol. 47, p. 74]

Interestingly, in the second outline of the **Civil War in France**,
Marx used words almost identical to Engels latter explanation:

> *"But the proletariat cannot, as the ruling classes and their
> different rival fractions have done in the successive hours of their
> triumph, simply lay hold on the existent State body and wield this
> ready-made agency for their own purpose. The first condition for the
> holding of political power, is to **transform its working machinery**
> and destroy it as an instrument of class rule."* [our emphasis,
> **Collected Works**, vol. 22, p. 533]

It is, of course, true that Marx expressed in his defence of the Commune
the opinion that new *"Communal Constitution"* was to become a *"reality
by the destruction of the State power"* yet he immediately argues that
*"the merely repressive organs of the old government power were to be
amputated"* and *"its legitimate functions were to be wrestles from"* it
and *"restored to the responsible agents of society."* [**Selected
Works**, pp. 288-9] This corresponds to Engels arguments about removing
aspects from the state inherited by the proletariat and signifies the
*"destruction"* of the state machinery (its bureaucratic-military
aspects) rather than the republic itself.

In other words, Lenin was right to state that *"Marx's idea is that the
working class must **break up, smash** the 'ready-made state machinery,'
and not confine itself to merely laying hold of it."* This was never
denied by thinkers like Karl Kautsky, rather they stressed that for Marx
and Engels universal suffrage was the means by which political power
would be seized (at least in a republic) while violent revolution would
be the means to create a republic and to defend it against attempts to
restore the old order. As Engels put it in 1886, Marx had drawn *"the
conclusion that, at least in Europe, England is the only country where
the inevitable social revolution might be effected entirely by peaceful
and legal means. He certainly never forgot to add that he hardly
expected the English ruling classes to submit, without a 'pro-slavery
rebellion,' to this peaceful and legal revolution."* [*"Preface to the
English edition"* in Marx, **Capital**, vol. 1, p. 113] Thus Kautsky
stressed that the abolition of the standing army was *"absolutely
necessary if the state is to be able to carry out significant social
reforms"* once the party of the proletariat was in a position to
*"control legislation."* This would mean *"the most complete democracy,
a militia system"* after, echoing the **Communist Manifesto**, *"the
conquest of democracy"* had been achieved. [**The Road to Power**, p.
69, p. 70 and p. 72]

Essentially, then, Lenin was utilising a confusion between smashing the
state and smashing the state machine once the workers' party had
achieved a majority within a democratic republic. In other words, Lenin
was wrong to assert that *"this lesson . . . had not only been
completely ignored, but positively distorted by the prevailing,
Kautskyite, 'interpretation' of Marxism."* As we have proved *"the false
notion that universal suffrage 'in the **present-day** state' is really
capable of revealing the will of the majority of the working people and
of securing its realisation"* was **not** invented by the
*"petty-bourgeois democrats"* nor *"the social-chauvinists and
opportunists."* It can be found repeatedly in the works of Engels and
Marx themselves and so *"Engels's perfectly clear, concise and concrete
statement is distorted at every step"* not only *"at every step in the
propaganda and agitation of the 'official' (i.e., opportunist) socialist
parties"* but also by Engels himself! [**Op. Cit.** p. 336 and pp.
319-20]

Significantly, we find Marx recounting in 1852 how the *"executive power
with its enormous bureaucratic and military organisation, with its
wide-ranging and ingenious state machinery . . . sprang up in the days
of the absolute monarchy, with the decay of the feudal system which it
had helped to hasten."* After 1848, *"in its struggle against the
revolution, the parliamentary republic found itself compelled to
strengthen, along with the repressive, the resources and centralisation
of governmental power. All revolutions perfected this machine instead of
smashing it. The parties that contended in turn for domination regarded
the possession of this huge state edifice as the principal spoils of the
victor."* However, *"under the absolute monarchy, during the first
Revolution, under Napoleon, bureaucracy was only the means of preparing
the class rule of the bourgeoisie. Under the Restoration, under Louis
Philippe, under the parliamentary republic, it was the instrument of the
ruling class, however much it strove for power of its own."* It was
*"[o]nly under the second Bonaparte does the state seem to have made
itself completely independent."* [**Selected Works**, pp. 169-70]

This analysis is repeated in **The Civil War in France**, except the
expression *"the State power"* is used as an equivalent to the *"state
machinery."* Again, the state machine/power is portrayed as coming into
existence **before** the republic: *"The centralised state power, with
its ubiquitous organs of standing army, police, bureaucracy, clergy, and
judicature . . . originates from the days of absolute monarchy."* Again,
the *"bourgeois republicans . . . took the state power"* and used it to
repress the working class. Again, Marx called for *"the destruction of
the state power"* and noted that the Commune abolished the standing
army, the privileged role of the clergy, and so on. The Commune's *"very
existence presupposed the non-existence of monarchy, which, in Europe at
least, is the normal encumbrance and indispensable cloak of class rule.
It supplied the republic with the basis of really democratic
institutions."* [**Op. Cit.** p. 285, p. 286, p. 288 and p. 290]

Obviously, then, what the socialist revolution had to smash existed
**before** the republican state was created and was an inheritance of
pre-bourgeois rule (even if the bourgeoisie utilised it for its own
ends). How this machine was to be smashed was left unspecified but given
that it was not identical to the *"parliamentary republic"* Marx's
arguments cannot be taken as evidence that the democratic state needed
to be smashed or destroyed rather than seized by means of universal
suffrage (and reformed appropriately, by *"smashing"* the *"state
machinery"* as well as including recall of representatives and the
combining of administrative and legislative tasks into their hands).
Clearly, Lenin's attempt to equate the *"parliamentary republic"* with
the *"state machinery"* cannot be supported in Marx's account. At best,
it could be argued that it is the spirit of Marx's analysis, perhaps
bringing it up to date. However, this was **not** Lenin's position (he
maintained that social democracy had hidden Marx's clear call to smash
the bourgeois democratic state).

Unsurprisingly, Lenin does not discuss the numerous quotes by Marx and
Engels on this matter which clearly contradict his thesis. Nor mention
that in 1871, a few months after the Commune, Marx argued that in
Britain, *"the way to show [i.e., manifest] political power lies open to
the working class. Insurrection would be madness where peaceful
agitation would more swiftly and surely do the work."* [**Collected
Works**, vol. 22, p. 602] The following year, saw him suggest that
America could join it as *"the workers can achieve their aims by
peaceful means"* there as well [**Op. Cit.**, vol. 23, p. 255] How if
Marx **had** concluded that the capitalist state had to be destroyed
rather than captured and refashioned then he quickly changed his mind!
In fact, during the Commune itself, in April 1871, Marx had written to
his friend Ludwig Kugelman *"[i]f you look at the last chapter of my
**Eighteenth Brumaire** you will find that I say that the next attempt
of the French revolution will be no longer, as before, to transfer the
bureaucratic military machine from one hand to another, but to break it,
and that is essential for every real people’s revolution on the
Continent. And this is what our heroic Party [sic!] comrades in Paris
are attempting."* [**Op. Cit.**, vol. 44, p. 131] As noted above, Marx
explicitly noted that the bureaucratic military machine predated the
republic and was, in effect, inherited by it.

Lenin did note that Marx *"restricts his conclusion to the Continent"*
on the issue of smashing the state machine, but does not list an obvious
factor, that the UK approximated universal suffrage, in why this was the
case (thus Lenin did not note that Engels, in 1891, added *"democratic
republics like France"* to the list of states where *"the old society
may peacefully evolve into the new."* [**Op. Cit.**, vol. 27, p. 226]).
In 1917, Lenin argued, *"this restriction"* was *"no longer valid"* as
both Britain and America had *"completely sunk into the all-European
filthy, bloody morass of bureaucratic-military institutions."* [**Op.
Cit.**, pp. 336-7] Subsequently, he repeated this claim in his polemic
against Karl Kautsky, stating that notions that reforming the state were
now out of date because of *"the existence of **militarism** and a
**bureaucracy**"* which *"were **non-existent** in Britain and America"*
in the 1870s. He pointed to how *"the most democratic and republican
bourgeoisie in America . . . deal with workers on strike"* as further
proof of his position. [**Collected Works**, vol. 28, p. 238 and p. 244]
However, this does not impact on the question of whether universal
suffrage could be utilised in order to be in a position to smash this
state machine or not. Equally, Lenin failed to acknowledge the violent
repression of strikes in the 1870s and 1880s in America (such as the
Great Upheaval of 1877 or the crushing of the 8 hour day movement after
the Haymarket police riot of 1886). As Martov argued correctly:

> *"The theoretic possibility [of peaceful reform] has not revealed
> itself in reality. But the sole fact that he admitted such a
> possibility shows us clearly Marx’s opinion, leaving no room for
> arbitrary interpretation. What Marx designated as the 'destruction of
> the State machine' . . . was the destruction of the **military and
> bureaucratic apparatus** that the bourgeois democracy had inherited
> from the monarchy and perfected in the process of consolidating the
> rule of the bourgeois class. There is nothing in Marx’s reasoning that
> even suggests the destruction of the **State organisation as such**
> and the replacement of the State during the revolutionary period, that
> is during the dictatorship of the proletariat, with a social bond
> formed on a **principle opposed to that of the State.** Marx and
> Engels foresaw such a substitution only at the end of a process of 'a
> progressive withering away' of the State and all the functions of
> social **coercion**. They foresaw this atrophy of the State and the
> functions of social coercion to be the result of the prolonged
> existence of the socialist regime."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 31]

It should also be remembered that Marx's comments on smashing the state
machine were made in response to developments in France, a regime that
Marx and Engels viewed as **not** being purely bourgeois. Marx notes in
his account of the Commune how, in France, *"[p]eculiar historical
circumstances"* had *"prevented the classical development . . . of the
bourgeois form of government."* [**Selected Works**, p. 289] For Engels,
Proudhon *"confuses the French Bureaucratic government with the normal
state of a bourgeoisie that rules both itself and the proletariat."*
[**Collected Works**, vol. 11, p. 548] In the 1870s, Marx considered
Holland, Britain and the USA to have *"the genuine capitalist state."*
[**Op. Cit.**, vol. 24, p. 499] Significantly, it was precisely these
states in which Marx had previously stated a peaceful revolution could
occur:

> *"We know that the institutions, customs and traditions in the
> different countries must be taken into account; and we do not deny the
> existence of countries like America, England, and if I knew your
> institutions better I might add Holland, where the workers may achieve
> their aims by peaceful means. That being the true, we must admit that
> in most countries on the continent it is force which must be the lever
> of our revolution; it is force which will have to be resorted to for a
> time in order to establish the rule of the workers."* [**Op. Cit.**,
> vol. 23, p. 255]

Interestingly, in 1886, Engels expanded on Marx's speculation as regards
Holland and confirmed it. Holland, he argued, as well as *"a residue of
local and provincial self-government"* also had *"an absence of any real
bureaucracy in the French or Prussian sense"* because, alone in Western
Europe, it did not have an *"absolute monarchy"* between the 16th and
18th century. This meant that *"only a few changes will have to be made
to establish that free self-government by the working [people] which
will necessarily be our best tool in the organisation of the mode of
production."* [**Op. Cit.**, vol. 47, pp. 397-8] Few would argue that
smashing the state and its replacement with a new workers' one would
really constitute a *"few changes"*! However, Engels position does fit
in with the notion that the *"state machine"* to be smashed is a legacy
of absolute monarchy rather than the state structure of a bourgeois
democratic republic. It also shows the nature of a Marxist revolution in
a republic, in a *"genuine capitalist state"* of the type Marx and
Engels expected to be the result of the first stage of any revolt.

The source of Lenin's restatement of the Marxist theory of the state
which came as such a shock to so many Marxists can be found in the
nature of the Paris Commune. After all, the major influence in terms of
*"political vision"* of the Commune was anarchism. The *"rough sketch of
national organisation which the Commune had no time to develop"* which
Marx praises but does not quote was written by a follower of Proudhon.
[**Selected Works**, p. 288] It expounded a clearly **federalist** and
"bottom-up" organisational structure. It clearly implied *"the
destruction of the State power"* rather than seeking to *"inherit"* it.
Based on this libertarian revolt, it is unsurprising that Marx's defence
of it took on a libertarian twist. As noted by Bakunin, who argued that
its *"general effect was so striking that the Marxists themselves, who
saw their ideas upset by the uprising, found themselves compelled to
take their hats off to it. They went further, and proclaimed that its
programme and purpose where their own, in face of the simplest logic . .
. This was a truly farcical change of costume, but they were bound to
make it, for fear of being overtaken and left behind in the wave of
feeling which the rising produced throughout the world."* [**Michael
Bakunin: Selected Writings**, p. 261]

The nature of **The Civil War in France** and the circumstances in which
it was written explains why. Marx, while publicly opposing any kind of
revolt before hand, did support the Commune once it began. His essay is
primarily a propaganda piece in defence of it and is, fundamentally,
reporting on what the Commune actually did and advocated. Thus, as well
as reporting the Communal Constitution's vision of a federation of
communes, we find Marx noting, also without comment, that Commune
decreed *"the surrender to associations of workmen, under reserve of
compensation, of all closed workshops and factories."* [**Op. Cit.**, p.
294] While Engels, at times, suggested that this could be a possible
policy for a socialist government, it is fair to say that few Marxists
consider Marx's reporting of this particular aspect of the Commune as
being a key aspect of his ideology. As Marx's account reports on the
facts of the Commune it could hardly **not** reflect the libertarian
ideas which were so strong in both it and the French sections of the
International - ideas he had spent much time and energy opposing.
Moreover, given the frenzy of abuse the Communards were subject to it by
the bourgeoisie, it was unlikely that Marx would have aided the reaction
by being overly critical. Equally, given how positively the Commune had
been received in working class and radical circles Marx would have been
keen to gain maximum benefit from it for both the International and his
own ideology and influence. This would also have ensured that Marx kept
his criticisms quiet, particularly as he was writing on behalf of an
organisation which was not Marxist and included various different
socialist tendencies.

This means that to fully understand Marx and Engels, we need to look at
**all** their writings, before and after the Paris Commune. It is,
therefore, significant that **immediately** after the Commune Marx
stated that workers could achieve socialism by utilising existing
democratic states **and** that the labour movement should take part in
political action and send workers to Parliament. There is no mention of
a federation of communes in these proposals and they reflect ideas both
he and Engels had expressed since the 1840s. Ten years after the
Commune, Marx stated that it was *"merely an uprising of one city in
exceptional circumstances.* [**Collected Works**, vol. 46, p. 66]
Similarly, a mere 3 years after the Commune, Engels argued that the key
thing in Britain was *"to form anew a strong workers' party with a
definite programme, and the best political programme they could wish for
was the People's Charter."* [**Op. Cit.**, vol. 23, p. 614] The Commune
was not mentioned and, significantly, Marx had previously defined this
programme in 1855 as being *"to increase and extend the omnipotence of
Parliament by elevating it to people’s power. They [the Chartists] are
not breaking up parliamentarism but are raising it to a higher power."*
[**Op. Cit.**, vol. 14, p. 243]

As such, Marx's defence of the Commune should not mean ignoring the
whole body of his and Engels work, nor should Marx's conclusion that the
*"state machinery"* must be smashed in a successful revolution be
considered to be in contradiction with his comments on utilising the
existing democratic republic. It does, however, suggest that Marx's
reporting of the Proudhon-influenced ideas of the Communards cannot be
taken as a definitive account of his ideas on social transformation.

The fact that Marx did not mention anything about abolishing the
existing state and replacing it with a new one in his contribution to
the *"Program of the French Workers Party"* in 1880 is significant. It
said that the *"collective appropriation"* of the means of production
*"can only proceed from a revolutionary action of the class of producers
- the proletariat - organised in an independent political party."* This
would be *"pursued by all the means the proletariat has at its disposal
including universal suffrage which will thus be transformed from the
instrument of deception that it has been until now into an instrument of
emancipation."* [**Op. Cit.**, vol. 24, p. 340] There is nothing about
overthrowing the existing state and replacing it with a new state,
rather the obvious conclusion which is to be drawn is that universal
suffrage was the tool by which the workers would achieve socialism. It
does fit in, however, with Marx's repeated comments that universal
suffrage was the equivalent of political power for the working class
where the proletariat was the majority of the population. Or, indeed,
Engels numerous similar comments. It explains the repeated suggestion by
Marx that there were countries like America and Britain *"where the
workers can achieve their aims by peaceful means."* There is Engels:

> *"One can imagine that the old society could peacefully grow into the
> new in countries where all power is concentrated in the people's
> representatives, where one can constitutionally do as one pleases as
> soon as a majority of the people give their support; in democratic
> republics like France and America, in monarchies such as England,
> where the dynasty is powerless against the popular will. But in
> Germany, where the government is virtually all-powerful and the
> Reichstag and other representative bodies are without real power, to
> proclaim likewise in Germany . . . is to accept the fig leaf of
> absolutism and to bind oneself to it."* [**Op. Cit.**, vol. 27, p.
> 226]

This, significantly, repeats Marx's comments in an unpublished article
from 1878 on the Reichstag debates on the anti-socialist laws where, in
part, he suggested that *"[i]f in England . . . or the United States,
the working class were to gain a majority in Parliament or Congress,
they could by lawful means, rid themselves of such laws and institutions
as impeded their development . . . However, the 'peaceful' movement
might be transformed into a 'forcible' one by resistance on the part of
those interested in restoring the former state of affairs; if . . . they
are put down by **force**, it is as rebels against 'lawful' force."*
[**Op. Cit.**, vol. 24, p. 248] Sadly, he never finished and published
it but it is in line with many of his public pronouncements on this
subject.

Marx also excluded countries on the European mainland (with the possible
exception of Holland) from his suggestions of peaceful reform. In those
countries, presumably, the first stage of the revolution would be, as
stressed in the **Communist Manifesto**, creating a fully democratic
republic (*"to win the battle for democracy"* - see [section
H.1.1](secH1.html#sech11)). As Engels put it, *"the first and direct
result of the revolution with regard to the **form** can and **must** be
nothing but the **bourgeois** republic. But this will be here only a
brief transitional period . . . The bourgeois republic . . . will enable
us to **win over the great masses of the workers to revolutionary
socialism** . . . Only them can we successfully take over."* The
*"proletariat can only use the form of the one and indivisible
republic"* for it is *"the sole political form in which the struggle
between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie can be fought to a finish."*
[Marx and Engels, **The Socialist Revolution**, p. 265, p. 283 and p.
294] As he summarised:

> *"Marx and I, for forty years, repeated ad nauseam that for us the
> democratic republic is the only political form in which the struggle
> between the working class and the capitalist class can first be
> universalised and then culminate in the decisive victory of the
> proletariat."* [**Collected Works**, vol. 27, p. 271]

It is for these reasons that orthodox Marxism up until 1917 held the
position that the socialist revolution would be commenced by seizing the
existing state (usually by the ballot box, or by insurrection if that
was impossible). Martov in his discussion of Lenin's "discovery" of the
"real" Marxist theory on the state (in **State and Revolution**)
stressed that the idea that the state should be smashed by the workers
who would then *"transplant into the structure of society the forms of
**their own** combat organisations"* was a libertarian idea, alien to
Marx and Engels. While acknowledging that *"in our time, working people
take to 'the idea of the soviets' after knowing them as combat
organisations formed in the process of the class struggle at a sharp
revolutionary stage,"* he distanced Marx and Engels quite successfully
from such a position. [**Op. Cit.**, p. 42] As such, he makes a valid
contribution to Marxism and presents a necessary counter-argument to
Lenin's claims (at which point, we are sure, nine out of ten Leninists
will dismiss our argument regardless of how well it explains apparent
contradictions in Marx and Engels or how much evidence can be presented
in support of it!).

This position should not be confused with a totally reformist position,
as social-democracy became. Marx and Engels were well aware that a
revolution would be needed to create and defend a republic. Engels, for
example, noted *"how totally mistaken is the belief that a republic, and
not only a republic, but also a communist society, can be established in
a cosy, peaceful way."* Thus violent revolution was required to create a
republic - Marx and Engels were revolutionaries, after all. Within a
republic, both recognised that insurrection would be required to defend
democratic government against attempts by the capitalist class to
maintain its economic position. Universal suffrage was, to quote Engels,
*"a splendid weapon"* which, while *"slower and more boring than the
call to revolution"*, was *"ten times more sure and what is even better,
it indicates with the most perfect accuracy the day when a call to armed
revolution has to be made."* This was because it was *"even ten to one
that universal suffrage, intelligently used by the workers, will drive
the rulers to overthrow legality, that is, to put us in the most
favourable position to make revolution."* *"The big mistake"*, Engels
argued, was *"to think that the revolution is something that can be made
overnight. As a matter of fact it is a process of development of the
masses that takes several years even under conditions accelerating this
process."* Thus it was a case of, *"as a revolutionary, any means which
leads to the goal is suitable, including the most violent and the most
pacific."* [Marx and Engels, **The Socialist Revolution**, p. 283, p.
189, p. 265 and p. 274] However, over time and as social democratic
parties and universal suffrage spread, the emphasis did change from
insurrection (the **Communist Manifesto**'s *"violent overthrow of the
bourgeoisie"*) to Engels last pronouncement that *"the conditions of
struggle had essentially changed. Rebellion in the old style, street
fighting with barricades . . . , was to a considerable extent
obsolete."* [**Selected Works**, p. 45 and pp. 653-4]

Obviously, neither Marx nor Engels (unlike Bakunin, significantly) saw
the rise of reformism which usually made this need for the ruling class
to *"overthrow legality"* redundant. Nor, for that matter, did they see
the effect of economic power in controlling workers parties once in
office. Sure, armed coups have taken place to overthrow even slightly
reformist governments but, thanks to the use of "political action", the
working class was in no position to *"make revolution"* in response.
Not, of course, that these have been required in most republics as
utilising Marxist methods have made many radical parties so reformist
that the capitalists can easily tolerate their taking office or can
utilise economic and bureaucratic pressures to control them.

So far from arguing, as Lenin suggested, for the destruction of the
capitalist state, Marx and Engels consistently advocated the use of
universal suffrage to gain control over the state, control which then
would be used to smash or shatter the *"state machine."* Revolution
would be required to create a republic and to defend it against
reaction, but the key was the utilisation of political action to take
political power within a democratic state. The closest that Marx or
Engels came to advocating workers councils was in 1850 when Marx
suggested that the German workers *"establish their own revolutionary
workers' governments"* alongside of the *"new official governments"*.
These could be of two forms, either of *"municipal committees and
municipal councils"* or *"workers' clubs or workers' committees."* There
is no mention of how these would be organised but their aim would be to
supervise and threaten the official governments *"by authorities backed
by the whole mass of the workers."* These clubs would be
*"centralised"*. In addition, *"workers candidates are [to be] put up
alongside of the bourgeois-democratic candidates"* to *"preserve their
independence"*. (although this "independence" meant taking part in
bourgeois institutions so that *"the demands of the workers must
everywhere be governed by the concessions and measures of the
democrats."*). [**The Marx-Engels Reader**, p. 507, p. 508 and p. 510]
So while these *"workers' committees"* could, in theory, be elected from
the workplace Marx made no mention of this possibility (talk of
*"municipal councils"* suggests that such a possibility was alien to
him). It also should be noted that Marx was echoing Proudhon who, the
year before, had argued that the clubs *"had to be organised. The
organisation of popular societies was the fulcrum of democracy, the
corner-stone of the republican order."* [**No Gods, No Masters**, vol.
1, p. 48] So, as with the soviets, even the idea of workers' clubs as a
means of ensuring mass participation was first raised by anarchists
(although, of course, inspired by working class self-organisation during
the 1848 French revolution).

All this may seem a bit academic to many. Does it matter? After all,
most Marxists today subscribe to some variation of Lenin's position and
so, in some aspects, what Marx and Engels really thought is irrelevant.
Indeed, it is possible that Marx faced with workers' councils, as he was
with the Commune, would have embraced them (perhaps not, as he was
dismissive of similar ideas expressed in the libertarian wing of the
First International). After all, the Mensheviks used Marx's 1850s
arguments to support their activities in the soviets in 1905 (while the
Bolshevik's expressed hostility to both the policy and the soviets) and,
of course, there is nothing in them to exclude such a position. What is
important is that the idea that Marxists have always subscribed to the
idea that a social revolution would be based on the workers' own combat
organisations (be they unions, soviets or whatever) is a relatively new
one to the ideology. If, as John Rees asserts, *"the socialist
revolution must counterpoise the soviet to parliament . . . precisely
because it needs an organ which combines economic power - the power to
strike and take control of the workplaces - with an insurrectionary bid
for political power"* and *"breaking the old state"* then the ironic
thing is that it was Bakunin, **not** Marx, who advocated such a
position. [**Op. Cit.**, p. 25] Given this, the shock which met Lenin's
arguments in 1917 can be easily understood.

Rather than being rooted in the Marxist vision of revolution, as it has
been in anarchism since at least the 1860s, workers councils have
played, rhetoric aside, the role of fig-leaf for party power
(libertarian Marxism being a notable exception). They have been embraced
by its Leninist wing purely as a means of ensuring party power. Rather
than being seen as the most important gain of a revolution as they allow
mass participation, workers' councils have been seen, and used, simply
as a means by which the party can seize power. Once this is achieved,
the soviets can be marginalised and ignored without affecting the
"proletarian" nature of the revolution in the eyes of the party:

> *"while it is true that Lenin recognised the different functions and
> democratic raison d'être for both the soviets and his party, in the
> last analysis it was the party that was more important than the
> soviets. In other words, the party was the final repository of
> working-class sovereignty. Thus, Lenin did not seem to have been
> reflected on or have been particularly perturbed by the decline of the
> soviets after 1918."* [Samuel Farber, **Before Stalinism**, p. 212]

This perspective can be traced back to the lack of interest Marx and
Engels expressed in the forms which a proletarian revolution would take,
as exemplified by Engels comments on having to *"lop off"* aspects of
the state *"inherited"* by the working class. The idea that the
organisations people create in their struggle for freedom may help
determine the outcome of the revolution is missing. Rather, the idea
that any structure can be appropriated and (after suitable modification)
used to rebuild society is clear. This cannot but flow from the flawed
Marxist theory of the state we discussed in [section
H.3.7](secH3.html#sech37). If, as Marx and Engels argued, the state is
simply an instrument of class rule then it becomes unproblematic to
utilise the existing republican state or create a new form of state
complete with representative structures. The Marxist perspective,
moreover, cannot help take emphasis away from the mass working class
organisations required to rebuild society in a socialist manner and
place it on the group who will *"inherit"* the state and *"lop off"* its
negative aspects, namely the party and the leaders in charge of both it
and the new "workers' state."

This focus towards the party became, under Lenin (and the Bolsheviks in
general) a purely instrumental perspective on workers' councils and
other organisations. They were of use purely in so far as they allowed
the Bolshevik party to take power (indeed Lenin constantly identified
workers' power and soviet power with Bolshevik power and as Martin Buber
noted, for Lenin ***"All power to the Soviets!"*** meant, at bottom,
***"All power to the Party through the Soviets!"***). It can, therefore,
be argued that his book **State and Revolution** was a means to use Marx
and Engels to support his new found idea of the soviets as being the
basis of creating a Bolshevik government rather than a principled
defence of workers' councils as the framework of a socialist revolution.
We discuss this issue in the [next section](secH3.html#sech311).

H.3.11 Does Marxism aim to give power to workers organisations?
---------------------------------------------------------------

The short answer depends on which branch of Marxism you mean.

If you are talking about libertarian Marxists such as council
communists, Situationists and so on, then the answer is a resounding
"yes." Like anarchists, these Marxists see a social revolution as being
based on working class self-management and, indeed, criticised (and
broke with) Bolshevism precisely on this question. Some Marxists, like
the **Socialist Party of Great Britain**, stay true to Marx and Engels
and argue for using the ballot box (see [last
section](secH3.html#sech310)) although this not exclude utilising such
organs once political power is seized by those means. However, if we
look at the mainstream Marxist tradition (namely Leninism), the answer
has to be an empathic "no."

As we noted in [section H.1.4](secH1.html#sech14), anarchists have long
argued that the organisations created by the working class in struggle
would be the initial framework of a free society. These organs, created
to resist capitalism and the state, would be the means to overthrow both
as well as extending and defending the revolution (such bodies have
included the "soviets" and "factory committees" of the Russian
Revolution, the collectives in the Spanish revolution, popular
assemblies of the 2001 Argentine revolt against neo-liberalism and the
French Revolution, revolutionary unions and so on). Thus working class
self-management is at the core of the anarchist vision and so we stress
the importance (and autonomy) of working class organisations in the
revolutionary movement and the revolution itself. Anarchists work within
such bodies at the base, in the mass assemblies, and do not seek to
replace their power with that of their own organisation (see [section
J.3.6](secJ3.html#secj36)).

Leninists, in contrast, have a different perspective on such bodies.
Rather than placing them at the heart of the revolution, Leninism views
them purely in instrumental terms - namely, as a means of achieving
party power. Writing in 1907, Lenin argued that *"Social-Democratic
Party organisations may, in case of necessity, participate in
inter-party Soviets of Workers' Delegates . . . and in congresses . . .
of these organisations, and may organise such institutions, provided
this is done on strict Party lines for the purpose of developing and
strengthening the Social-Democratic Labour Party"*, that is *"utilise"*
such organs *"for the purpose of developing the Social-Democratic
movement."* Significantly, given the fate of the soviets post-1917,
Lenin noted that the party *"must bear in mind that if Social-Democratic
activities among the proletarian masses are properly, effectively and
widely organised, such institutions may actually become superfluous."*
[**Collected Works**, vol. 12, pp. 143-4] Thus the means by which
working class can manage their own affairs would become *"superfluous"*
once the party was in power. How the working class could be considered
the "ruling class" in such a society is hard to understand.

As Oscar Anweiler summarises in his account of the soviets during the
two Russian Revolutions:

> *"The drawback of the new 'soviet democracy' hailed by Lenin in 1906
> is that he could envisage the soviets only as **controlled**
> organisations; for him they were instruments by which the party
> controlled the working masses, rather than true forms of a workers
> democracy. The basic contradiction of the Bolshevik soviet system -
> which purports to be a democracy of all working people but in reality
> recognises only the rule of one party - is already contained in
> Lenin's interpretation of the soviets during the first Russian
> revolution."* [**The Soviets**, p. 85]

Thirteen years later, Lenin repeated this same vision of party power as
the goal of revolution in his infamous diatribe against "Left-wing"
Communism (i.e. those Marxists close to anarchism) as we noted in
[section H.3.3](secH3.html#sech33). The Bolsheviks had, by this stage,
explicitly argued for party dictatorship and considered it a truism that
the whole proletariat could not rule nor could the proletarian
dictatorship be exercised by a mass working class organisation.
Therefore, rather than seeing revolution being based upon the
empowerment of working class organisation and the socialist society
being based on this, Leninists see workers organisations in purely
instrumental terms as the means of achieving a Leninist government:

> *"With all the idealised glorification of the soviets as a new,
> higher, and more democratic type of state, Lenin's principal aim was
> revolutionary-strategic rather than social-structural . . . The slogan
> of the soviets was primarily tactical in nature; the soviets were in
> theory organs of mass democracy, but in practice tools for the
> Bolshevik Party. In 1917 Lenin outlined his transitional utopia
> without naming the definitive factor: the party. To understand the
> soviets' true place in Bolshevism, it is not enough, therefore, to
> accept the idealised picture in Lenin's state theory. Only an
> examination of the actual give-and-take between Bolsheviks and soviets
> during the revolution allows a correct understanding of their
> relationship."* [Oscar Anweiler, **Op. Cit.**, pp. 160-1]

Simply out, Leninism confuses the party power and workers' power. An
example of this "confusion" can be found in most Leninist works. For
example, John Rees argues that *"the essence of the Bolsheviks' strategy
. . . was to take power from the Provisional government and put it in
the hands of popular organs of working class power - a point later made
explicit by Trotsky in his **Lessons of October**."* [*"In Defence of
October"*, pp. 3-82, **International Socialism**, no. 52, p. 73]
However, in reality Lenin had always been clear that the essence of the
Bolsheviks' strategy was the taking of power by the Bolshevik party
**itself.** He explicitly argued for Bolshevik power during 1917,
considering the soviets as the best means of achieving this. He
constantly equated Bolshevik rule with working class rule. Once in
power, this identification did not change. As such, rather than argue
for power to be placed into *"the hands of popular organs of working
class power"* Lenin argued this only insofar as he was sure that these
organs would then **immediately** pass that power into the hands of a
Bolshevik government.

This explains his turn against the soviets after July 1917 when he
considered it impossible for the Bolsheviks to gain a majority in them.
It can be seen when the Bolshevik party's Central Committee opposed the
idea of a coalition government immediately after the overthrow of the
Provisional Government in October 1917. As it explained, *"a purely
Bolshevik government"* was *"impossible to refuse"* since *"a majority
at the Second All-Russian Congress of Soviets . . . handed power over to
this government."* [quoted by Robert V. Daniels, **A Documentary History
of Communism**, pp. 127-8] A mere ten days after the October Revolution
the Left Social Revolutionaries charged that the Bolshevik government
was ignoring the Central Executive Committee of the Soviets, established
by the second Congress of Soviets as the supreme organ in society. Lenin
dismissed their charges, stating that *"the new power could not take
into account, in its activity, all the rigmarole which would set it on
the road of the meticulous observation of all the formalities."* [quoted
by Frederick I. Kaplan, **Bolshevik Ideology and the Ethics of Soviet
Labour**, p. 124] Clearly, the soviets did not have *"All Power,"* they
promptly handed it over to a Bolshevik government (and Lenin implies
that he was not bound in any way to the supreme organ of the soviets in
whose name he ruled). All of which places Rees' assertions into the
proper context and shows that the slogan *"All Power to the Soviets"* is
used by Leninists in a radically different way than most people would
understand by it! It also explains why soviets were disbanded if the
opposition won majorities in them in early 1918 (see [section
H.6.1](secH6.html#sech61)). The Bolsheviks only supported *"Soviet
power"* when the soviets were Bolshevik. As was recognised by leading
left-Menshevik Julius Martov, who argued that the Bolsheviks loved
Soviets only when they were *"in the hands of the Bolshevik party."*
[quoted by Israel Getzler, **Op. Cit.**, p. 174] Which explains Lenin's
comment that *"[o]nly the development of this war [Kornilov's
counter-revolutionary rebellion in August 1917] can bring **us** to
power but we must **speak** of this as little as possible in our
agitation (remembering very well that even tomorrow events may put us in
power and then we will not let it go)."* [quoted by Neil Harding,
**Leninism**, p. 253]

All this can be confirmed, unsurprisingly enough, by looking at the
essay Rees references. When studying Trotsky's work we find the same
instrumentalist approach to the question of the *"popular organs of
working class power."* Yes, there is some discussion on whether soviets
or *"some of form of organisation"* like factory committees could become
*"organs of state power"* but this is always within the context of party
power. This is stated quite clearly by Trotsky in his essay when he
argued that the *"essential aspect"* of Bolshevism was the *"training,
tempering, and organisation of the proletarian vanguard as enables the
latter to seize power, arms in hand."* [**Lessons of October**, p. 167
and p. 127] As such, the vanguard seizes power, **not** *"popular organs
of working class power."* Indeed, the idea that the working class can
seize power itself is raised and dismissed:

> *"But the events have proved that without a party capable of directing
> the proletarian revolution, the revolution itself is rendered
> impossible. The proletariat cannot seize power by a spontaneous
> uprising . . . there is nothing else that can serve the proletariat as
> a substitute for its own party."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 117]

Hence soviets were not considered as the *"essence"* of Bolshevism,
rather the *"fundamental instrument of proletarian revolution is the
party."* Popular organs are seen purely in instrumental terms, with such
organs of "workers' power" discussed in terms of the strategy and
program of the party not in terms of the value that such organs have as
forms of working class self-management of society. Why should he, when
*"the task of the Communist party is the conquest of power for the
purpose of reconstructing society"*? [**Op. Cit.**, p. 118 and p. 174]

This can be clearly seen from Trotsky's discussion of the "October
Revolution" of 1917 in **Lessons of October**. Commenting on the
Bolshevik Party conference of April 1917, he stated that the *"whole of
. . . [the] Conference was devoted to the following fundamental
question: Are we heading toward the conquest of power in the name of the
socialist revolution or are we helping (anybody and everybody) to
complete the democratic revolution? . . . Lenin's position was this: . .
. the capture of the soviet majority; the overthrow of the Provisional
Government; the seizure of power through the soviets."* [**Op. Cit.**,
p. 134] Note, **through** the soviets not **by** the soviets, thus
showing that the Party would hold the real power, not the soviets of
workers' delegates. This is confirmed when Trotsky stated that *"to
prepare the insurrection and to carry it out under cover of preparing
for the Second Soviet Congress and under the slogan of defending it, was
of inestimable advantage to us"* and that it was *"one thing to prepare
an armed insurrection under the naked slogan of the seizure of power by
the party, and quite another thing to prepare and then carry out an
insurrection under the slogan of defending the rights of the Congress of
Soviets."* The Soviet Congress just provided *"the legal cover"* for the
Bolshevik plans. [**Op. Cit.**, p. 134, p. 158 and p. 161]

Thus we have the *"seizure of power through the soviets"* with *"an
armed insurrection"* for *"the seizure of power by the party"* being
hidden by *"the slogan"* (*"the legal cover"*) of defending the Soviets!
Hardly a case of placing power in the hands of working class
organisations. Trotsky **did** note that in 1917 the *"soviets had to
either disappear entirely or take real power into their hands."*
However, he immediately added that *"they could take power . . . only as
the dictatorship of the proletariat directed by a single party."* [**Op.
Cit.**, p. 126] Clearly, the *"single party"* has the real power,
**not** the soviets an unsurprisingly the rule of *"a single party"*
also amounted to the soviets effectively disappearing as they quickly
became mere ciphers it. Soon the *"direction"* by *"a single party"*
became the dictatorship of that party **over** the soviets, which (it
should be noted) Trotsky defended wholeheartedly when he wrote **Lessons
of October** (and, indeed, into the 1930s).

This cannot be considered as a one-off. Trotsky repeated this analysis
in his **History of the Russian Revolution**, when he stated that the
*"question, what mass organisations were to serve the party for
leadership in the insurrection, did not permit an **a priori,** much
less a categorical, answer."* Thus the *"mass organisations"* serve the
party, not vice versa. This instrumentalist perspective can be seen when
Trotsky noted that when *"the Bolsheviks got a majority in the Petrograd
Soviet, and afterward a number of others,"* the *"phrase 'Power to the
Soviets' was not, therefore, again removed from the order of the day,
but received a new meaning: All power to the **Bolshevik** soviets."*
This meant that the *"party was launched on the road of armed
insurrection through the soviets and in the name of the soviets."* As he
put it in his discussion of the July days in 1917, the army *"was far
from ready to raise an insurrection in order to give power to the
Bolshevik Party"* and so *"the state of popular consciousness . . . made
impossible the seizure of power by the Bolsheviks in July."* [vol. 2, p.
303, p. 307, p. 78 and p. 81] So much for *"all power to the Soviets"*!
He even quotes Lenin: *"The Bolsheviks have no right to await the
Congress of Soviets. They ought to seize the power right **now.**"*
Ultimately, the *"Central Committee adopted the motion of Lenin as the
only thinkable one: to form a government of the Bolsheviks only."* [vol.
3, pp. 131-2 and p. 299]

So where does this leave the assertion that the Bolsheviks aimed to put
power into the hands of working class organisations? Clearly, Rees'
summary of both Trotsky's essay and the *"essence"* of Bolshevism leave
a lot to be desired. As can be seen, the *"essence"* of Trotsky's essay
and of Bolshevism is the importance of party power, not workers' power
(as recognised by another member of the SWP: *"The masses needed to be
profoundly convinced that there was no alternative to Bolshevik power."*
[Tony Cliff, **Lenin**, vol. 2, p. 265]). Trotsky even provided us with
an analogy which effectively and simply refutes Rees' claims. *"Just as
the blacksmith cannot seize the red hot iron in his naked hand,"*
Trotsky asserted, *"so the proletariat cannot directly seize power; it
has to have an organisation accommodated to this task."* While paying
lip service to the soviets as the organisation *"by means of which the
proletariat can both overthrow the old power and replace it,"* he added
that *"the soviets by themselves do not settle the question"* as they
may *"serve different goals according to the programme and leadership.
The soviets receive their programme from the party . . . the
revolutionary party represents the brain of the class. The problem of
conquering the power can be solved only by a definite combination of
party with soviets."* [**The History of the Russian Revolution**, vol.
3, pp. 160-1 and p. 163]

Thus the key organisation was the party, **not** the mass organisations
of the working class. Indeed, Trotsky was quite explicit that such
organisations could only become the state form of the proletariat under
the party dictatorship. Significantly, Trotsky fails to indicate what
would happen when these two powers clash. Certainly Trotsky's role in
the Russian revolution tells us that the power of the party was more
important to him than democratic control by workers through mass bodies
and as we have shown in [section H.3.8](secH3.html#sech38), Trotsky
explicitly argued that a state was required to overcome the *"wavering"*
in the working class which could be expressed by democratic decision
making.

Given this legacy of viewing workers' organisations in purely
instrumental terms, the opinion of Martov (the leading left-Menshevik
during the Russian Revolution) seems appropriate. He argued that *"[a]t
the moment when the revolutionary masses expressed their emancipation
from the centuries old yoke of the old State by forming 'autonomous
republics of Kronstadt' and trying Anarchist experiments such as
'workers' control,' etc. - at that moment, the 'dictatorship of the
proletariat and the poorest peasantry' (said to be incarnated in the
real dictatorship of the opposed 'true' interpreters of the proletariat
and the poorest peasantry: the chosen of Bolshevist Communism) could
only consolidate itself by first dressing itself in such Anarchist and
anti-State ideology."* [**The State and Socialist Revolution**, p. 47]
As can be seen, Martov had a point. As the text used as evidence that
the Bolsheviks aimed to give power to workers organisations shows, this
was **not** an aim of the Bolshevik party. Rather, such workers organs
were seen purely as a means to the end of party power.

In contrast, anarchists argue for direct working class self-management
of society. When we argue that working class organisations must be the
framework of a free society we mean it. We do not equate party power
with working class power or think that *"All power to the Soviets"* is
possible if they immediately delegate that power to the leaders of the
party. This is for obvious reasons:

> *"If the revolutionary means are out of their hands, if they are in
> the hands of a techno-bureaucratic elite, then such an elite will be
> in a position to direct to their own benefit not only the course of
> the revolution, but the future society as well. If the proletariat are
> to **ensure** that an elite will not control the future society, they
> must prevent them from controlling the course of the revolution."*
> [Alan Carter, **Marx: A Radical Critique**, p. 165]

Thus the slogan *"All power to the Soviets"* for anarchists means
exactly that - organs for the working class to run society directly,
based on mandated, recallable delegates. This slogan fitted perfectly
with our ideas, as anarchists had been arguing since the 1860's that
such workers' councils were both a weapon of class struggle against
capitalism and the framework of the future libertarian society. For the
Bolshevik tradition, that slogan simply means that a Bolshevik
government will be formed over and above the soviets. The difference is
important, *"for the Anarchists declared, if 'power' really should
belong to the soviets, it could not belong to the Bolshevik party, and
if it should belong to that Party, as the Bolsheviks envisaged, it could
not belong to the soviets."* [Voline, **The Unknown Revolution**, p.
213] Reducing the soviets to simply executing the decrees of the central
(Bolshevik) government and having their All-Russian Congress be able to
recall the government (i.e. those with **real** power) does not equal
*"all power,"* quite the reverse - the soviets will simply be a fig-leaf
for party power.

In summary, rather than aim to place power into the hands of workers'
organisations, most Marxists do not. Their aim is to place power into
the hands of the party. Workers' organisations are simply means to this
end and, as the Bolshevik regime showed, if they clash with that goal,
they will be simply be disbanded. However, we must stress that not all
Marxist tendencies subscribe to this. The council communists, for
example, broke with the Bolsheviks precisely over this issue, the
difference between party and class power.

H.3.12 Is big business the precondition for socialism?
------------------------------------------------------

A key idea in most forms of Marxism is that the evolution of capitalism
itself will create the preconditions for socialism. This is because
capitalism tends to result in big business and, correspondingly,
increased numbers of workers subject to the *"socialised"* production
process within the workplace. The conflict between the socialised means
of production and their private ownership is at the heart of the Marxist
case for socialism:

> "Then came the concentration of the means of production and of the
> producers in large workshops and manufactories, their transformation
> into actual socialised means of production and socialised producers.
> But the socialised producers and means of production and their
> products were still treated, after this change, just as they had been
> before . . . the owner of the instruments of labour . . . appropriated
> to himself . . . exclusively the product of the **labour of others.**
> Thus, the products now produced socially were not appropriated by
> those who actually set in motion the means of production and actually
> produced the commodities, but by the **capitalists** . . . The mode of
> production is subjected to this [individual or private] form of
> appropriation, although it abolishes the conditions upon which the
> latter rests.
> "This contradiction, which gives to the new mode of production its
> capitalistic character, **contains the germ of the whole of the social
> antagonisms of today.**" [Engels, **Marx-Engels Reader**, pp. 703-4]

It is the business cycle of capitalism which show this contradiction
between socialised production and capitalist appropriation the best.
Indeed, the *"fact that the socialised organisation of production within
the factory has developed so far that it has become incompatible with
the anarchy of production in society, which exists side by side with and
dominates it, is brought home to the capitalists themselves by the
violent concentration of capital that occurs during crises."* The
pressures of socialised production results in capitalists merging their
properties *"in a particular branch of industry in a particular
country"* into *"a trust, a union for the purpose of regulating
production."* In this way, *"the production of capitalistic society
capitulates to the production upon a definite plan of the invading
socialistic society."* This *"transformation"* can take the form of
*"joint-stock companies and trusts, or into state ownership."* The later
does not change the *"capitalist relation"* although it does have
*"concealed within it"* the *"technical conditions that form the
elements of that solution."* This *"shows itself the way to
accomplishing this revolution. **The proletariat seizes political power
and turns the means of production into state property.**"* [**Op.
Cit.**, p. 709, p. 710, p. 711, p. 712 and p. 713]

Thus the centralisation and concentration of production into bigger and
bigger units, into big business, is seen as the evidence of the need for
socialism. It provides the objective grounding for socialism, and, in
fact, this analysis is what makes Marxism *"scientific socialism."* This
process explains how human society develops through time:

> *"In the social production of their life, men enter into definite
> relations that are indispensable and independent of their will,
> relations of production which correspond to a definite stage of
> development of their material productive forces. The sum total of
> these relations of production constitutes the economic structure of
> society, the real foundation, on which rises a legal and political
> superstructure and to which correspond definite forms of social
> consciousness . . . At a certain stage of their development, the
> material productive forces come in conflict with the existing
> relations of production or - what is but a legal expression for the
> same thing - with the property relations within which they have been
> at work hitherto. From forms of development of the productive forces
> these relations turn into their fetters. Then begins an epoch of
> social revolution. With the change of the economic foundation the
> entire immense superstructure is more or less rapidly transformed."*
> [Marx, **Op. Cit.**, pp. 4-5]

The obvious conclusion to be drawn from this is that socialism will come
about due to tendencies inherent within the development of capitalism.
The *"socialisation"* implied by collective labour within a firm grows
steadily as capitalist companies grow larger and larger. The objective
need for socialism is therefore created and so, for most Marxists,
***"big is beautiful."*** Indeed, some Leninists have invented
terminology to describe this, which can be traced back to at least as
far as Bolshevik (and Left Oppositionist) Evgeny Preobrazhensky
(although his perspective, like most Leninist ones, has deep roots in
the Social Democratic orthodoxy of the Second International).
Preobrazhensky, as well as expounding the need for *"primitive socialist
accumulation"* to build up Soviet Russia's industry, also discussed
*"the contradiction of the law of planning and the law of value."*
[Hillel Ticktin, *"Leon Trotsky and the Social Forces Leading to
Bureaucracy, 1923-29"*, pp. 45-64, **The Ideas of Leon Trotsky**, Hillel
Ticktin and Michael Cox (eds.), p. 45] Thus Marxists in this tradition
(like Hillel Ticktin) argue that the increased size of capital means
that more and more of the economy is subject to the despotism of the
owners and managers of capital and so the *"anarchy"* of the market is
slowly replaced with the conscious planning of resources. Marxists
sometimes call this the *"objective socialisation of labour"* (to use
Ernest Mandel's term). Thus there is a tendency for Marxists to see the
increased size and power of big business as providing objective evidence
for socialism, which will bring these socialistic tendencies within
capitalism to full light and full development. Needless to say, most
will argue that socialism, while developing planning fully, will replace
the autocratic and hierarchical planning of big business with
democratic, society-wide planning.

This position, for anarchists, has certain problems associated with it.
One key drawback, as we discuss in the [next
section](secH3.html#sech313), is it focuses attention away from the
internal organisation within the workplace onto ownership and links
between economic units. It ends up confusing capitalism with the market
relations between firms rather than identifying it with its essence,
wage slavery. This meant that many Marxists consider that the basis of a
socialist economy was guaranteed once property was nationalised. This
perspective tends to dismiss as irrelevant the way production is
managed. The anarchist critique that this simply replaced a multitude of
bosses with one, the state, was (and is) ignored. Rather than seeing
socialism as being dependent on workers' management of production, this
position ends up seeing socialism as being dependent on organisational
links between workplaces, as exemplified by big business under
capitalism. Thus the *"relations of production"* which matter are
**not** those associated with wage labour but rather those associated
with the market. This can be seen from the famous comment in **The
Manifesto of the Communist Party** that the bourgeoisie *"cannot exist
without constantly revolutionising the instruments of production, and
thereby the relations of production, and with them the whole relations
of society."* [Marx and Engels, **Op. Cit.**, p. 476] But the one
relation of production it **cannot** revolutionise is the one generated
by the wage labour at the heart of capitalism, the hierarchical
relations at the point of production. As such, it is clear that by
*"relations of production"* Marx and Engels meant something else than
wage slavery, namely, the internal organisation of what they term
*"socialised production."*

Capitalism is, in general, as dynamic as Marx and Engels stressed. It
transforms the means of production, the structure of industry and the
links between workplaces constantly. Yet it only modifies the form of
the organisation of labour, not its content. No matter how it transforms
machinery and the internal structure of companies, the workers are still
wage slaves. At best, it simply transforms much of the hierarchy which
governs the workforce into hired managers. This does not transform the
fundamental social relationship of capitalism, however and so the
*"relations of production"* which prefigure socialism are, precisely,
those associated with the *"socialisation of the labour process"* which
occurs **within** capitalism and are no way antagonistic to it.

This mirrors Marx's famous prediction that the capitalist mode of
production produces *"the centralisation of capitals"* as one capitalist
*"always strikes down many others."* This leads to *"the further
socialisation of labour and the further transformation of the soil and
other means of production into socially exploited and therefore communal
means of production takes on a new form."* Thus capitalist progress
itself objectively produces the necessity for socialism as it socialises
the production process and produces a working class *"constantly
increasing in numbers, and trained, united and organised by the very
mechanism of the capitalist process of production. The monopolisation of
capital becomes a fetter upon the mode of production . . . The
centralisation of the means of production and the socialisation of
labour reach a point at which they become incompatible with their
capitalist integument. This integument is burst asunder. The knell of
capitalist private property sounds. The expropriators are
expropriated."* [**Capital**, vol. 1, pp. 928-9] Note, it is not the
workers who organise themselves but rather they are *"organised by the
very mechanism of the capitalist process of production."* Even in his
most libertarian work, *"The Civil War in France"*, this perspective can
be found. He, rightly, praised attempts by the Communards to set up
co-operatives (although distinctly failed to mention Proudhon's obvious
influence) but then went on to argue that the working class had *"no
ready-made utopias to introduce"* and that *"to work out their own
emancipation, and along with it that that higher form to which present
society is irresistibly tending by its own economical agencies"* they
simply had *"to set free the elements of the new society with which old
collapsing bourgeois society itself is pregnant."* [**Marx-Engels
Reader**, pp. 635-6]

Then we have Marx, in his polemic against Proudhon, arguing that social
relations *"are closely bound up with productive forces. In acquiring
new productive forces men change their mode of production; and in
changing their mode of production, in changing the way of earning their
living, they change their social relations. The hand-mill gives you
society with the feudal lord; the steam-mill, society with the
industrial capitalist."* [**Collected Works**, vol. 6, p. 166] On the
face of it, this had better **not** be true. After all, the aim of
socialism is to expropriate the property of the industrial capitalist.
If the social relationships **are** dependent on the productive forces
then, clearly, socialism is impossible as it will have to be based,
initially, on the legacy of capitalism. Fortunately, the way a workplace
is managed is not predetermined by the technological base of society. As
is obvious, a steam-mill can be operated by a co-operative, so making
the industrial capitalist redundant. That a given technological basis
(or productive forces) can produces many different social and political
systems can easily be seen from history. Murray Bookchin gives one
example:

> "Technics . . . does not fully or even adequately account for the
> institutional differences between a fairly democratic federation such
> as the Iroquois and a highly despotic empire such as the Inca. From a
> strictly instrumental viewpoint, the two structures were supported by

> patently exploitative priesthood and state apparatus under a nearly
> industrial system of management." [**The Ecology of Freedom**, pp.
> 331-2]

Marx's claim that a given technological level implies a specific social
structure is wrong. However, it does suggest that our comments that, for
Marx and Engels, the new *"social relationships"* which develop under
capitalism which imply socialism are relations between workplaces,
**not** those between individuals and so classes are correct. The
implications of this position became clear during the Russian
revolution.

Later Marxists built upon this "scientific" groundwork. Lenin, for
example, argued that *"the difference between a socialist revolution and
a bourgeois revolution is that in the latter case there are ready made
forms of capitalist relationships; Soviet power [in Russia] does not
inherit such ready made relationships, if we leave out of account the
most developed forms of capitalism, which, strictly speaking, extended
to a small top layer of industry and hardly touched agriculture."*
[**Collected Works**, vol. 27, p. 90] Thus, for Lenin, *"socialist"*
relationships are generated within big business, relationships
"socialism" would *"inherit"* and universalise. As such, his comments
fit in with the analysis of Marx and Engels we have presented above.
However, his comments also reveal that Lenin had no idea that socialism
meant the transformation of the relations of production, i.e. workers
managing their own activity. This, undoubtedly, explains the systematic
undermining of the factory committee movement by the Bolsheviks in
favour of state control (see Maurice Brinton's classic account of this
process, **The Bolsheviks and Workers' Control**).

The idea that socialism involved simply taking over the state and
nationalising the *"objectively socialised"* means of production can be
seen in both mainstream social-democracy and its Leninist child. Rudolf
Hilferding argued that capitalism was evolving into a highly centralised
economy, run by big banks and big firms. All what was required to turn
this into socialism would be its nationalisation:

> *"Once finance capital has brought the most important branches of
> production under its control, it is enough for society, through its
> conscious executive organ - the state conquered by the working class -
> to seize finance capital in order to gain immediate control of these
> branches of production . . . taking possession of six large Berlin
> banks would . . . greatly facilitate the initial phases of socialist
> policy during the transition period, when capitalist accounting might
> still prove useful."* [**Finance Capital**, pp. 367-8]

Lenin basically disagreed with this only in-so-far as the party of the
proletariat would take power via revolution rather than by election
(*"the state conquered by the working class"* equals the election of a
socialist party). Lenin took it for granted that the difference between
Marxists and anarchists is that *"the former stand for centralised,
large-scale communist production, while the latter stand for
disconnected small production."* [**Collected Works**, vol. 23, p. 325]
The obvious implication of this is that anarchist views *"express, not
the future of bourgeois society, which is striving with irresistible
force towards the socialisation of labour, but the present and even the
past of that society, the domination of blind chance over the scattered
and isolated small producer."* [**Op. Cit.**, vol. 10, p. 73]

Lenin applied this perspective during the Russian Revolution. For
example, he argued in 1917 that his immediate aim was for a *"state
capitalist"* economy, this being a necessary stage to socialism. As he
put it, *"socialism is merely the next step forward from
state-capitalist monopoly . . . socialism is merely state-capitalist
monopoly **which is made to serve the interests of the whole people**
and has to that extent **ceased** to be capitalist monopoly."* [**Op.
Cit.**, vol. 25, p. 358] The Bolshevik road to "socialism" ran through
the terrain of state capitalism and, in fact, simply built upon its
institutionalised means of allocating recourses and structuring
industry. As Lenin put it, *"the modern state possesses an apparatus
which has extremely close connections with the banks and syndicates
[i.e., trusts] , an apparatus which performs an enormous amount of
accounting and registration work . . . This apparatus must not, and
should not, be smashed. It must be wrestled from the control of the
capitalists,"* it *"must be subordinated to the proletarian Soviets"*
and *"it must be expanded, made more comprehensive, and nation-wide."*
This meant that the Bolsheviks would *"not invent the organisational
form of work, but take it ready-made from capitalism"* and *"borrow the
best models furnished by the advanced countries."* [**Op. Cit.**, vol.
26, pp. 105-6 and p. 110]

The institutional framework of capitalism would be utilised as the
principal (almost exclusive) instruments of "socialist" transformation.
*"**Without big banks Socialism would be impossible,**"* argued Lenin,
as they *"are the 'state apparatus' which we need to bring about
socialism, and which we **take ready-made** from capitalism; our task
here is merely to **lop off** what capitalistically mutilates this
excellent apparatus, to make it **even bigger,** even more democratic,
even more comprehensive. A single State Bank, the biggest of the big . .
. will constitute as much as nine-tenths of the **socialist** apparatus.
This will be country-wide book-keeping, country-wide accounting of the
production and distribution of goods."* While this is *"not fully a
state apparatus under capitalism,"* it *"will be so with us, under
socialism."* For Lenin, building socialism was easy. This *"nine-tenths
of the socialist apparatus"* would be created *"at one stroke, by a
single decree."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 106] Once in power, the Bolsheviks
implemented this vision of socialism being built upon the institutions
created by monopoly capitalism. Moreover, Lenin quickly started to
advocate and implement the most sophisticated capitalist methods of
organising labour, including *"one-man management"* of production,
piece-rates and Taylorism (*"scientific management"*). This was not done
accidentally or because no alternative existed (as we discuss in
[section H.6.2](secH6.html#sech62), workers were organising federations
of factory committees which could have been, as anarchists argued at the
time, the basis of a genuine socialist economy).

As Gustav Landuer commented, when mainstream Marxists *"call the
capitalist factory system a social production . . . we know the real
implications of their socialist forms of labour."* [**For Socialism**,
p. 70] As can be seen, this glorification of large-scale,
state-capitalist structures can be traced back to Marx and Engels, while
Lenin's support for capitalist production techniques can be explained by
mainstream Marxism's lack of focus on the social relationships at the
point of production.

For anarchists, the idea that socialism can be built on the framework
provided to us by capitalism is simply ridiculous. Capitalism has
developed industry and technology to further the ends of those with
power, namely capitalists and managers. Why should they use that power
to develop technology and industrial structures which lead to workers'
self-management and power rather than technologies and structures which
enhance their own position vis-à-vis their workers and society as a
whole? As such, technological and industrial development is not
"neutral" or just the "application of science." They are shaped by class
struggle and class interest and cannot be used for different ends.
Simply put, socialism will need to develop **new** forms of economic
organisation based on socialist principles. The concept that monopoly
capitalism paves the way for socialist society is rooted in the false
assumption that the forms of social organisation accompanying capital
concentration are identical with the socialisation of production, that
the structures associated with collective labour under capitalism are
the same as those required under socialism is achieve **genuine**
socialisation. This false assumption, as can be seen, goes back to
Engels and was shared by both Social Democracy and Leninism despite
their other differences.

While anarchists are inspired by a vision of a non-capitalist,
decentralised, diverse society based on appropriate technology and
appropriate scale, mainstream Marxism is not. Rather, it sees the
problem with capitalism is that its institutions are not centralised and
big enough. As Alexander Berkman correctly argues:

> *"The role of industrial decentralisation in the revolution is
> unfortunately too little appreciated. . . Most people are still in the
> thraldom of the Marxian dogma that centralisation is 'more efficient
> and economical.' They close their eyes to the fact that the alleged
> 'economy' is achieved at the cost of the workers' limb and life, that
> the 'efficiency' degrades him to a mere industrial cog, deadens his
> soul, kills his body. Furthermore, in a system of centralisation the
> administration of industry becomes constantly merged in fewer hands,
> producing a powerful bureaucracy of industrial overlords. It would
> indeed be the sheerest irony if the revolution were to aim at such a
> result. It would mean the creation of a new master class."* [**What is
> Anarchism?**, p. 229]

That mainstream Marxism is soaked in capitalist ideology can be seen
from Lenin's comments that when *"the separate establishments are
amalgamated into a single syndicate, this economy [of production] can
attain tremendous proportions, as economic science teaches us."* [**Op.
Cit.**, vol. 25, p. 344] Yes, **capitalist** economic science, based on
**capitalist** definitions of efficiency and economy and on
**capitalist** criteria! That Bolshevism bases itself on centralised,
large scale industry because it is more "efficient" and "economic"
suggests nothing less than that its "socialism" will be based on the
same priorities of capitalism. This can be seen from Lenin's idea that
Russia had to learn from the advanced capitalist countries, that there
was only one way to develop production and that was by adopting
capitalist methods of "rationalisation" and management. Thus, for Lenin
in early 1918 *"our task is to study the state capitalism of the
Germans, to spare **no effort** in copying it and not to shrink from
adopting **dictorial** methods to hasten the copying of it."* [**Op.
Cit.**, vol. 27, p. 340] In the words of Luigi Fabbri:

> "Marxist communists, especially Russian ones, are beguiled by the
> distant mirage of big industry in the West or America and mistake for
> a system of production what is only a typically capitalist means of
> speculation, a means of exercising oppression all the more securely;
> and they do not appreciate that that sort of centralisation, far from

> accumulating more money." [*"Anarchy and 'Scientific' Communism"*, pp.
> 13-49, **The Poverty of Statism**, Albert Meltzer (ed.), pp. 21-22]

Efficiency, in other words, does not exist independently of a given
society or economy. What is considered "efficient" under capitalism may
be the worse form of inefficiency in a free society. The idea that
socialism may have **different** priorities, need **different** methods
of organising production, have **different** visions of how an economy
was structured than capitalism, is absent in mainstream Marxism. Lenin
thought that the institutions of bourgeois economic power, industrial
structure and capitalist technology and techniques could be "captured"
and used for other ends. Ultimately, though, capitalist means and
organisations can only generate capitalist ends. It is significant that
the *"one-man management,"* piece-work, Taylorism, etc. advocated and
implemented under Lenin are usually listed by his followers as evils of
Stalinism and as proof of its anti-socialist nature.

Equally, it can be argued that part of the reason why large capitalist
firms can "plan" production on a large scale is because they reduce the
decision making criteria to a few variables, the most significant being
profit and loss. That such simplification of input data may result in
decisions which harm people and the environment goes without a saying.
*"The lack of context and particularity,"* James C. Scott correctly
notes, *"is not an oversight; it is the necessary first premise of any
large-scale planning exercise. To the degree that the subjects can be
treated as standardised units, the power of resolution in the planning
exercise is enhanced. Questions posed within these strict confines can
have definitive, quantitative answers. The same logic applies to the
transformation of the natural world. Questions about the volume of
commercial wood or the yield of wheat in bushels permit more precise
calculations than questions about, say, the quality of the soil, the
versatility and taste of the grain, or the well-being of the community.
The discipline of economics achieves its formidable resolving power by
transforming what might otherwise be considered qualitative matters into
quantitative issues with a single metric and, as it were, a bottom line:
profit or loss."* [**Seeing like a State**, p. 346] Whether a socialist
society could factor in all the important inputs which capitalism
ignores within an even more centralised planning structure is an
important question. It is extremely doubtful that there could be a
positive answer to it. This does not mean, we just stress, that
anarchists argue exclusively for "small-scale" production as many
Marxists, like Lenin, assert (as we prove in [section
I.3.8](secI3.html#seci38), anarchists have always argued for
**appropriate** levels of production and scale). It is simply to raise
the possibility of what works under capitalism may be undesirable from a
perspective which values people and planet instead of power and profit.

As should be obvious, anarchism is based on critical evaluation of
technology and industrial structure, rejecting the whole capitalist
notion of "progress" which has always been part of justifying the
inhumanities of the status quo. Just because something is rewarded by
capitalism it does not mean that it makes sense from a human or
ecological perspective. This informs our vision of a free society and
the current struggle. We have long argued that that capitalist methods
cannot be used for socialist ends. In our battle to democratise and
socialise the workplace, in our awareness of the importance of
collective initiatives by the direct producers in transforming their
work situation, we show that factories are not merely sites of
production, but also of reproduction - the reproduction of a certain
structure of social relations based on the division between those who
give orders and those who take them, between those who direct and those
who execute.

It goes without saying that anarchists recognise that a social
revolution will have to start with the industry and technology which is
left to it by capitalism and that this will have to be expropriated by
the working class (this expropriation will, of course, involve
transforming it and, in all likelihood, rejecting of numerous
technologies, techniques and practices considered as "efficient" under
capitalism). This is **not** the issue. The issue is who expropriates it
and what happens to it next. For anarchists, the means of life are
expropriated directly by society, for most Marxists they are
expropriated by the state. For anarchists, such expropriation is based
workers' self-management and so the fundamental capitalist *"relation of
production"* (wage labour) is abolished. For most Marxists, state
ownership of production is considered sufficient to ensure the end of
capitalism (with, if we are lucky, some form of *"workers' control"*
over those state officials who do management production - see [section
H.3.14](secH3.html#sech314)).

In contrast to the mainstream Marxist vision of socialism being based
around the institutions inherited from capitalism, anarchists have
raised the idea that the *"free commune"* would be the *"medium in which
the ideas of modern Socialism may come to realisation."* These
*"communes would federate"* into wider groupings. Labour unions (or
other working class organs created in the class struggle such as factory
committees) were *"not only an instrument for the improvement of the
conditions of labour, but also . . . an organisation which might . . .
take into its hands the management of production."* Large labour
associations would *"come into existence for the inter-communal
service[s]."* Such communes and workers' organisations as the basis of
*"Socialist forms of life could find a much easier realisation"* than
the *"seizure of all industrial property by the State, and the State
organisation of agriculture and industry."* Thus railway networks
*"could be much better handled by a Federated Union of railway
employees, than by a State organisation."* Combined with co-operation
*"both for production and for distribution, both in industry and
agriculture,"* workers' self-management of production would create
*"samples of the bricks"* of the future society (*"even samples of some
of its rooms"*). [Kropotkin, **The Conquest of Bread**, pp. 21-23]

This means that anarchists also root our arguments for socialism in a
scientific analysis of tendencies within capitalism. However, in
opposition to the analysis of mainstream Marxism which focuses on the
objective tendencies within capitalist development, anarchists emphasis
the **oppositional** nature of socialism to capitalism. Both the *"law
of value"* and the *"law of planning"* are tendencies **within**
capitalism, that is aspects of capitalism. Anarchists encourage class
struggle, the direct conflict of working class people against the
workings of all capitalism's "laws". This struggle produces **mutual
aid** and the awareness that we can care best for our own welfare if we
**unite** with others - what we can loosely term the *"law of
co-operation"* or *"law of mutual aid"*. This law, in contrast to the
Marxian *"law of planning"* is based on working class subjectively and
develops within society only in **opposition** to capitalism. As such,
it provides the necessary understanding of where socialism will come
from, from **below**, in the spontaneous self-activity of the oppressed
fighting for their freedom. This means that the basic structures of
socialism will be the organs created by working class people in their
struggles against exploitation and oppress (see [section
I.2.3](secI2.html#seci23) for more details). Gustav Landauer's basic
insight is correct (if his means were not totally so) when he wrote that
*"Socialism will not grow out of capitalism but away from it"* [**Op.
Cit.**, p. 140] In other words, tendencies **opposed** to capitalism
rather than ones which are part and parcel of it.

Anarchism's recognition of the importance of these tendencies towards
mutual aid within capitalism is a key to understanding what anarchists
do in the here and now, as will be discussed in [section
J](secJcon.html). In addition, it also laid the foundation of
understanding the nature of an anarchist society and what creates the
framework of such a society in the here and now. Anarchists do not
abstractly place a better society (anarchy) against the current,
oppressive one. Instead, we analysis what tendencies exist within
current society and encourage those which empower and liberate people.
Based on these tendencies, anarchists propose a society which develops
them to their logical conclusion. Therefore an anarchist society is
created not through the developments within capitalism, but in social
struggle against it.

H.3.13 Why is state socialism just state capitalism?
----------------------------------------------------

For anarchists, the idea that socialism can be achieved via state
ownership is simply ridiculous. For reasons which will become abundantly
clear, anarchists argue that any such *"socialist"* system would simply
be a form of *"state capitalism."* Such a regime would not fundamentally
change the position of the working class, whose members would simply be
wage slaves to the state bureaucracy rather than to the capitalist
class. Marxism would, as Kropotkin predicted, be *"the worship of the
State, of authority and of State Socialism, which is in reality nothing
but State capitalism."* [quoted by Ruth Kinna, *"Kropotkin's theory of
Mutual Aid in Historical Context"*, pp. 259-283, **International Review
of Social History**, No. 40, p. 262]

However, before beginning our discussion of why anarchists think this we
need to clarify our terminology. This is because the expression *"state
capitalism"* has three distinct, if related, meanings in socialist
(particularly Marxist) thought. Firstly, *"state capitalism"* was/is
used to describe the current system of big business subject to extensive
state control (particularly if, as in war, the capitalist state accrues
**extensive** powers over industry). Secondly, it was used by Lenin to
describe his immediate aims after the October Revolution, namely a
regime in which the capitalists would remain but would be subject to a
system of state control inherited by the new *"proletarian"* state from
the old capitalist one. The third use of the term is to signify a regime
in which the state **replaces** the capitalist class **totally** via
nationalisation of the means of production. In such a regime, the state
would own, manage and accumulate capital rather than individual
capitalists.

Anarchists are opposed to all three systems described by the term
*"state capitalism."* Here we concentrate on the third definition,
arguing that state socialism would be better described as *"state
capitalism"* as state ownership of the means of life does not get to the
heart of capitalism, namely wage labour. Rather it simply replaces
private bosses with the state and changes the form of property (from
private to state property) rather than getting rid of it.

The idea that socialism simply equals state ownership (nationalisation)
is easy to find in the works of Marxism. The **Communist Manifesto**,
for example, states that the *"proletariat will use its political
supremacy to wrest, by degrees, all capital from the bourgeoisie, to
centralise all instruments of production into the hands of the State."*
This meant the *"[c]entralisation of credit in the hands of the State,
by means of a national bank with State capital and an exclusive
monopoly,"* the *"[c]entralisation of the means of communication and
transport in the hands of the State,"* *"[e]xtension of factories and
instruments of production owned by the State"* and the *"[e]stablishment
of industrial armies, especially for agriculture."* [Marx and Engels,
**Selected Works**, pp. 52-3] Thus *"feudal estates . . . mines, pits,
and so forth, would become property of the state"* as well as *"[a]ll
means of transport,"* with *"the running of large-scale industry and the
railways by the state."* [**Collected Works**, vol. 7, p. 3, p. 4 and p.
299]

Engels repeats this formula thirty-two years later in **Socialism:
Utopian and Scientific** by asserting that capitalism itself *"forces on
more and more the transformation of the vast means of production,
already socialised, into state property. **The proletariat seizes
political power and turns the means of production into state
property.**"* Socialism is **not** equated with state ownership of
productive forces by a capitalist state, *"but concealed within it are
the technical conditions that form the elements of that solution"* to
the social problem. It simply *"shows itself the way to accomplishing
this revolution. **The proletariat seizes political power and turns the
means of production into state property.**"* Thus state ownership
**after** the proletariat seizes power is the basis of socialism, when
by this *"first act"* of the revolution the state *"really constitutes
itself as the representative of the whole of society."* [**Marx-Engels
Reader**, p. 713, p. 712 and p. 713]

What is significant from these programmatic statements on the first
steps of socialism is the total non-discussion of what is happening at
the point of production, the non-discussion of the social relations in
the workplace. Rather we are subjected to discussion of *"the
contradiction between socialised production and capitalist
appropriation"* and claims that while there is *"socialised organisation
of production within the factory,"* this has become *"incompatible with
the anarchy of production in society."* The obvious conclusion to be
drawn is that "socialism" will inherit, without change, the
*"socialised"* workplace of capitalism and that the fundamental change
is that of ownership: *"The proletariat seized the public power, and by
means of this transforms the socialised means of production . . . into
public property. By this act, the proletariat frees the means of
production from the character of capital they have thus far borne."*
[Engels, **Op. Cit.**, p. 709 and p. 717]

That the Marxist movement came to see state ownership rather than
workers' management of production as the key issue is hardly surprising.
Thus we find leading Social-Democrats arguing that socialism basically
meant the state, under Social-Democratic control of course, acquiring
the means of production and nationalising them. Rudolf Hilferding
presented what was Marxist orthodoxy at the time when he argued that in
*"a communist society"* production *"is consciously determined by the
social central organ,"* which would decide *"what is to be produced and
how much, where and by whom."* While this information is determined by
the market forces under capitalism, in socialism it *"is given to the
members of the socialist society by their authorities . . . we must
derive the undisturbed progress of the socialist economy from the laws,
ordinances and regulations of socialist authorities."* [quoted by
Nikolai Bukharin, **Economy Theory of the Leisure Class**, p. 157] The
Bolsheviks inherited this concept of "socialism" and implemented it,
with terrible results.

This vision of society in which the lives of the population are
controlled by *"authorities"* in a *"social central organ"* which tells
the workers what to do, while in line with the **Communist Manifesto**,
seems less that appealing. It also shows why state socialism is not
socialism at all. Thus George Barrett:

> *"If instead of the present capitalist class there were a set of
> officials appointed by the Government and set in a position to control
> our factories, it would bring about no revolutionary change. The
> officials would have to be paid, and we may depend that, in their

> long as it lasts can be maintained only by the bloody brutality of the
> policeman's bludgeon and the soldier's rifle."* [**The Anarchist
> Revolution**, pp. 8-9]

The key to seeing why state socialism is simply state capitalism can be
found in the lack of change in the social relationships at the point of
production. The workers are still wage slaves, employed by the state and
subject to its orders. As Lenin stressed in **State and Revolution**,
under Marxist Socialism *"**[a]ll** citizens are transformed into hired
employees of the state . . . **All** citizens become employees and
workers of a single country-wide state 'syndicate' . . . The whole of
society will have become a single office and a single factory, with
equality of labour and pay."* [**Collected Works**, vol. 25, pp. 473-4]
Given that Engels had argued, against anarchism, that a factory required
subordination, authority, lack of freedom and *"a veritable despotism
independent of all social organisation,"* Lenin's idea of turning the
world into one big factory takes on an extremely frightening nature.
[**Marx-Engels Reader**, p. 731] A reality which one anarchist described
in 1923 as being the case in Lenin's Russia:

> *"The nationalisation of industry, removing the workers from the hands
> of individual capitalists, delivered them to the yet more rapacious
> hands of a single, ever-present capitalist boss, the State. The
> relations between the workers and this new boss are the same as
> earlier relations between labour and capital, with the sole difference
> that the Communist boss, the State, not only exploits the workers, but
> also punishes them himself . . . Wage labour has remained what it was
> before, except that it has taken on the character of an obligation to
> the State . . . It is clear that in all this we are dealing with a
> simple substitution of State capitalism for private capitalism."*
> [Peter Arshinov, **History of the Makhnovist Movement**, p. 71]

All of which makes Bakunin's comments seem justified (as well as
stunningly accurate):

> *"**Labour financed by the State** - such is the fundamental principle
> of **authoritarian Communism,** of State Socialism. The State,
> **having become the sole proprietor** . . . will have become sole
> capitalist, banker, money-lender, organiser, director of all national
> work, and the distributor of its profits."* [**The Political
> Philosophy of Bakunin**, p. 293]

Such a system, based on those countries *"where modern capitalist
development has reached its highest point of development"* would see
*"the gradual or violent expropriation of the present landlords and
capitalists, or of the appropriation of all land and capital by the
State. In order to be able to carry out its great economic and social
mission, this State will have to be very far-reaching, very powerful and
highly centralised. It will administer and supervise agriculture by
means of its appointed mangers, who will command armies of rural workers
organised and disciplined for that purpose. At the same time, it will
set up a single bank on the ruins of all existing banks."* Such a
system, Bakunin correctly predicted, would be *"a barracks regime for
the proletariat, in which a standardised mass of men and women workers
would wake, sleep, work and live by rote; a regime of privilege for the
able and the clever."* [**Michael Bakunin: Selected Writings**, p. 258
and p. 259]

Proudhon, likewise was well aware that state ownership did not mean the
end of private property, rather it meant a change in who ordered the
working class about. *"We do not want,"* he stated, *"to see the State
confiscate the mines, canals and railways; that would be to add to
monarchy, and more wage slavery. We want the mines, canals, railways
handed over to democratically organised workers' associations"* which
would be the start of a *"vast federation of companies and societies
woven into the common cloth of the democratic social Republic."* He
contrasted workers' associations run by and for their members to those
*"subsidised, commanded and directed by the State,"* which would crush
*"all liberty and all wealth, precisely as the great limited companies
are doing."* [**No Gods, No Masters**, vol. 1, p. 62 and p. 105]

Simply put, if workers did not directly manage their own work then it
matters little who formally owns the workplaces in which they toil. As
Maurice Brinton argued, libertarian socialists *"hold that the
'relations of production' - the relations which individuals or groups
enter into with one another in the process of producing wealth - are the
essential foundations of any society. A certain pattern of relations of
production is the common denominator of all class societies. This
pattern is one in which the producer does not dominate the means of
production but on the contrary both is 'separated from them' and from
the products of his [or her] own labour. In all class societies the
producer is in a position of subordination to those who manage the
productive process. Workers' management of production - implying as it
does the total domination of the producer over the productive process -
is not for us a marginal matter. It is the core of our politics. It is
the only means whereby authoritarian (order-giving, order-taking)
relations in production can be transcended and a free, communist or
anarchist, society introduced."* He went on to note that *"the means of
production may change hands (passing for instance from private hands
into those of a bureaucracy, collectively owning them) without this
revolutionising the relations of production. Under such circumstances -
and whatever the formal status of property - the society is still a
class society for production is still managed by an agency other than
the producers themselves. Property relations, in other words, do not
necessarily reflect the relations of production. They may serve to mask
them - and in fact they often have."* [**The Bolsheviks and Workers'
Control**, pp. vii-vii]

As such, for anarchists (and libertarian Marxists) the idea that state
ownership of the means of life (the land, workplaces, factories, etc.)
is the basis of socialism is simply wrong. Therefore, *"Anarchism cannot
look upon the coming revolution as a mere substitution . . . of the
State as the universal capitalist for the present capitalists."*
[Kropotkin, **Evolution and Environment**, p. 106] Given that the
*"State organisation having always been . . . the instrument for
establishing monopolies in favour of the ruling minorities, [it] cannot
be made to work for the destruction of these monopolies. The anarchists
consider, therefore, that to hand over to the State all the main sources
of economic life - the land, the mines, the railways, banking,
insurance, and so on - as also the management of all the main branches
of industry . . . would mean to create a new instrument of tyranny.
State capitalism would only increase the powers of bureaucracy and
capitalism."* [Kropotkin, **Anarchism**, p. 286] Needless to say, a
society which was not democratic in the workplace would not remain
democratic politically either. Either democracy would become as formal
as it is within any capitalist republic or it would be replaced by
dictatorship. So, without a firm base in the direct management of
production, any "socialist" society would see working class social power
(*"political power"*) and liberty wither and die, just like a flower
ripped out of the soil.

Unsurprisingly, given all this, we discover throughout history the
co-existence of private and state property. Indeed, the nationalisation
of key services and industries has been implemented under all kinds of
capitalist governments and within all kinds of capitalist states (which
proves the non-socialist nature of state ownership). Moreover,
anarchists can point to specific events where the capitalist class has
used nationalisation to undermine revolutionary gains by the working
class. The best example by far is in the Spanish Revolution, when the
Catalan government used nationalisation against the wave of spontaneous,
anarchist inspired, collectivisation which had placed most of industry
into the direct hands of the workers. The government, under the guise of
legalising the gains of the workers, placed them under state ownership
to stop their development, ensure hierarchical control and so class
society. A similar process occurred during the Russian Revolution under
the Bolsheviks. Significantly, *"many managers, at least those who
remained, appear to have preferred nationalisation (state control) to
workers' control and co-operated with Bolshevik commissars to introduce
it. Their motives are not too difficult to understand . . . The issue of
who runs the plants - who makes decisions - is, and probably always will
be, the crucial question for managers in any industrial relations
system."* [Jay B. Sorenson, **The Life and Death of Soviet Trade
Unionism**, pp. 67-8] As we discuss in the [next
section](secH3.html#sech314), the managers and capitalists were not the
only ones who disliked *"workers' control,"* the Bolsheviks did so as
well, and they ensured that it was marginalised within a centralised
system of state control based on nationalisation.

As such, anarchists think that a utterly false dichotomy has been built
up in discussions of socialism, one which has served the interests of
both capitalists and state bureaucrats. This dichotomy is simply that
the economic choices available to humanity are "private" ownership of
productive means (capitalism), or state ownership of productive means
(usually defined as "socialism"). In this manner, capitalist nations
used the Soviet Union, and continue to use autocracies like North Korea,
China, and Cuba as examples of the evils of "public" ownership of
productive assets. While the hostility of the capitalist class to such
regimes is often used by Leninists as a rationale to defend them (as
*"degenerated workers' states"*, to use the Trotskyist term) this is a
radically false conclusion. As one anarchist argued in 1940 against
Trotsky (who first raised this notion):

> *"Expropriation of the capitalist class is naturally terrifying to
> 'the bourgeoisie of the whole world,' but that does not prove anything
> about a workers' state . . . In Stalinist Russia expropriation is
> carried out . . . by, and ultimately for the benefit of, the
> bureaucracy, not by the workers at all. The bourgeoisie are afraid of
> expropriation, of power passing out of their hands, whoever seizes it
> from them. They will defend their property against any class or
> clique. The fact that they are indignant [about Stalinism] proves
> their fear - it tells us nothing at all about the agents inspiring
> that fear."* [J.H., *"The Fourth International"*, pp. 37-43, **The
> Left and World War II**, Vernon Richards (ed.), pp. 41-2]

Anarchists see little distinction between "private" ownership of the
means of life and "state" ownership. This is because the state is a
highly centralised structure specifically designed to exclude mass
participation and so, therefore, necessarily composed of a ruling
administrative body. As such, the "public" cannot actually "own" the
property the state claims to hold in its name. The ownership and thus
control of the productive means is then in the hands of a ruling elite,
the state administration (i.e. bureaucracy). The *"means of wealth
production"* are *"owned by the state which represents, as always, a
privileged class - the bureaucracy."* The workers *"do not either
individually or collectively own anything, and so, as elsewhere, are
compelled to sell their labour power to the employer, in this case the
state."* [*"USSR - The Anarchist Position"*, pp. 21-24, **Op. Cit.**, p.
23] Thus, the means of production and land of a state "socialist" regime
are **not** publicly owned - rather, they are owned by a bureaucratic
elite, **in the name of the people**, a subtle but important
distinction. As one Chinese anarchist put it:

> *"Marxian socialism advocates the centralisation not only of political
> power but also of capital. The centralisation of political power is
> dangerous enough in itself; add to that the placing of all sources of
> wealth in the hands of the government, and the so-called state
> socialism becomes merely state capitalism, with the state as the owner
> of the means of production and the workers as its labourers, who hand
> over the value produced by their labour. The bureaucrats are the
> masters, the workers their slaves. Even though they advocate a state
> of the dictatorship of workers, the rulers are bureaucrats who do not
> labour, while workers are the sole producers. Therefore, the suffering
> of workers under state socialism is no different from that under
> private capitalism."* [Ou Shengbai, quoted by Arif Dirlik, **Anarchism
> in the Chinese Revolution**, p. 224]

In this fashion, decisions about the allocation and use of the
productive assets are not made by the people themselves, but by the
administration, by economic planners. Similarly, in "private" capitalist
economies, economic decisions are made by a coterie of managers. In both
cases the managers make decisions which reflect their own interests and
the interests of the owners (be it shareholders or the state
bureaucracy) and **not** the workers involved or society as a whole. In
both cases, economic decision-making is top-down in nature, made by an
elite of administrators - bureaucrats in the state socialist economy,
capitalists or managers in the "private" capitalist economy. The
much-lauded distinction of capitalism is that unlike the monolithic,
centralised state socialist bureaucracy it has a **choice** of bosses
(and choosing a master is not freedom). And given the similarities in
the relations of production between capitalism and state "socialism,"
the obvious inequalities in wealth in so-called "socialist" states are
easily explained. The relations of production and the relations of
distribution are inter-linked and so inequality in terms of power in
production means inequality in control of the social product, which will
be reflected in inequality in terms of wealth. The mode of distributing
the social product is inseparable from the mode of production and its
social relationships. Which shows the fundamentally confused nature of
Trotsky's attempts to denounce the Stalinist regime's privileges as
"bourgeois" while defending its "socialist" economic base (see Cornelius
Castoriadis, *"The Relations of Production in Russia"*, pp. 107-158,
**Political and Social Writings**, vol. 1).

In other words, private property exists if some individuals (or groups)
control/own things which are used by other people. This means,
unsurprising, that state ownership is just a form of property rather
than the negation of it. If you have a highly centralised structure (as
the state is) which plans and decides about all things within
production, then this central administrative would be the real owner
because it has the exclusive right to decide how things are used,
**not** those using them. The existence of this central administrative
strata excludes the abolition of property, replacing socialism or
communism with state owned "property," i.e. **state** capitalism. As
such, state ownership does **not** end wage labour and, therefore,
social inequalities in terms of wealth and access to resources. Workers
are still order-takers under state ownership (whose bureaucrats control
the product of their labour and determine who gets what). The only
difference between workers under private property and state property is
the person telling them what to do. Simply put, the capitalist or
company appointed manager is replaced by a state appointed one.

As anarcho-syndicalist Tom Brown stressed, when *"the many control the
means whereby they live, they will do so by abolishing private ownership
and establishing common ownership of the means of production, with
workers' control of industry."* However, this is *"not to be confused
with nationalisation and state control"* as *"ownership is, in theory,
said to be vested in the people"* but, in fact *"control is in the hands
of a small class of bureaucrats."* Then *"common ownership does not
exist, but the labour market and wage labour go on, the worker remaining
a wage slave to State capitalism."* Simply put, common ownership
*"demands common control. This is possible only in a condition of
industrial democracy by workers' control."* [**Syndicalism**, p. 94] In
summary:

> *"Nationalisation is not Socialisation, but State Capitalism . . .
> Socialisation . . . is not State ownership, but the common, social
> ownership of the means of production, and social ownership implies
> control by the producers, not by new bosses. It implies Workers'
> Control of Industry - and that is Syndicalism."* [**Op. Cit.**, p.
> 111]

However, many Marxists (in particular Leninists) state they are in
favour of both state ownership **and** *"workers' control."* As we
discuss in more depth in [next section](secH3.html#sech314), while they
mean the same thing as anarchists do by the first term, they have a
radically different meaning for the second (it is for this reason
modern-day anarchists generally use the term *"workers'
self-management"*). To anarchist ears, the combination of
nationalisation (state ownership) and *"workers' control"* (and even
more so, self-management) simply expresses political confusion, a
mishmash of contradictory ideas which simply hides the reality that
state ownership, by its very nature, precludes workers' control. As
such, anarchists reject such contradictory rhetoric in favour of
*"socialisation"* and *"workers' self-management of production."*
History shows that nationalisation will always undermine workers'
control at the point of production and such rhetoric always paves the
way for state capitalism.

Therefore, anarchists are against both nationalisation **and**
privatisation, recognising both as forms of capitalism, of wage slavery.
We believe in genuine public ownership of productive assets, rather than
corporate/private or state/bureaucratic control. Only in this manner can
the public address their own economic needs. Thus, we see a third way
that is distinct from the popular "either/or" options forwarded by
capitalists and state socialists, a way that is entirely more
democratic. This is workers' self-management of production, based on
social ownership of the means of life by federations of self-managed
syndicates and communes.

Finally, it should be mentioned that some Leninists do have an analysis
of Stalinism as "state capitalist," most noticeably the British SWP.
According to the creator of this theory, Tony Cliff, Stalinism had to be
considered a class system because *"[i]f the state is the repository of
the means of production and the workers do not control it, they do not
own the means of production, i.e., they are not the ruling class."*
Which is fine, as far as it goes (anarchists would stress the social
relations **within** production as part of our criteria for what counts
as socialism). The problems start to accumulate when Cliff tries to
explain why Stalinism was (state) capitalist.

For Cliff, internally the USSR could be viewed as one big factory and
the division of labour driven by bureaucratic decree. Only when
Stalinism was *"viewed within the international economy the basic
features of capitalism can be discerned."* Thus it is international
competition which makes the USSR subject to "the law of value" and,
consequently, capitalist. However, as international trade was tiny under
Stalinism *"competition with other countries is mainly military."* It is
this indirect competition in military matters which made Stalinist
Russia capitalist rather than any internal factor. [**State capitalism
in Russia**, pp. 311-2, p. 221 and p. 223]

The weakness of this argument should be obvious. From an anarchist
position, it fails to discuss the social relations within production and
the obvious fact that workers could, and did, move workplaces (i.e.,
there was a market for labour). Cliff only mentions the fact that the
Stalinist regime's plans were never fulfilled when he shows up the
inefficiencies of Stalinist mismanagement. With regards to labour, that
appears to be divided according to the plan. Similarly, to explain
Stalinism's "capitalist" nature as being a product of military
competition with other, more obviously, capitalist states is a joke. It
is like arguing that Ford is a capitalist company because BMW is! As one
libertarian Marxist put it: *"One can only wonder as to the type of
contortions Cliff might have got into if Soviet military competition had
been with China alone!"* [Neil C. Fernandez, **Capitalism and Class
Struggle in the USSR**, p. 65] Significantly, Cliff raised the
possibility of single world-wide Stalinist regime and concluded it would
**not** be state capitalist, it would *"be a system of exploitation not
subject to the law of value and all its implications."* [**Op. Cit.**,
p. 225] As Fernandez correctly summarises:

> *"Cliff's position appears untenable when it is remembered that
> whatever capitalism may or may not entail, what it **is** a mode of
> production, defined by a certain type of social production relations.
> If the USSR is capitalist simply because it produces weaponry to
> compete with those countries that themselves would have been
> capitalist even without such competition, then one might as well say
> the same about tribes whose production is directed to the provision of
> tomahawks in the fight against colonialism."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 65]

Strangely, as Marxist, Cliff seemed unaware that, for Marx,
"competition" did not define capitalism. As far as trade goes, the
*"character of the production process from which [goods] derive is
immaterial"* and so on the market commodities come *"from all modes of
production"* (for example, they could be *"the produce of production
based on slavery, the product of peasants . . ., of a community . . . ,
of state production (such as existed in earlier epochs of Russian
history, based on serfdom) or half-savage hunting peoples"*).
[**Capital**, vol. 2, pp. 189-90] This means that trade *"exploits a
given mode of production but does not create it"* and so relates *"to
the mode of production from outside."* [**Capital**, vol. 3, p. 745]
Much the same can be said of military competition - it does not define
the mode of production.

There are other problems with Cliff's argument, namely that it implies
that Lenin's regime was also state capitalist (as anarchists stress, but
Leninists deny). If, as Cliff suggests, a "workers' state" is one in
which *"the proletariat has direct or indirect control, no matter how
restricted, over the state power"* then Lenin's regime was not one
within six months. Similarly, workers' self-management was replaced by
one-man management under Lenin, meaning that Stalin inherited the
(capitalistic) relations of production rather than created them.
Moreover, if it were military competition which made Stalinism "state
capitalist" then, surely, so was Bolshevik Russia when it was fighting
the White and Imperialist armies during the Civil War. Nor does Cliff
prove that a proletariat actually existed under Stalinism, raising the
clear contradiction that *"[i]f there is only one employer, a 'change of
masters' is impossible . . . a mere formality"* while also attacking
those who argued that Stalinism was *"bureaucratic collectivism"*
because Russian workers were **not** proletarians but rather slaves. So
this *"mere formality"* is used to explain that the Russian worker is a
proletarian, not a slave, and so Russia was state capitalist in nature!
[Cliff, **Op. Cit.**, p. 310, p. 219, p. 350 and p. 348]

All in all, attempts to draw a clear line between Leninism and Stalinism
as regards its state capitalist nature are doomed to failure. The
similarities are far too obvious and simply support the anarchist
critique of state socialism as nothing more than state capitalism.
Ultimately, *"Trotskyism merely promises socialism by adopting the same
methods, and mistakes, which have produced Stalinism."* [J.H., *"The
Fourth International"*, pp. 37-43, **The Left and World War II**, Vernon
Richards (ed.), p. 43]

H.3.14 Don't Marxists believe in workers' control?
--------------------------------------------------

As we discussed in the [last section](secH3.html#sech313), anarchists
consider the usual association of state ownership with socialism to be
false. We argue that it is just another form of the wages system, of
capitalism, albeit with the state replacing the capitalist and so state
ownership, for anarchists, is simply state capitalism. Instead we urge
socialisation based on workers' self-management of production.
Libertarian Marxists concur.

Some mainstream Marxists, however, say they seek to combine state
ownership with *"workers' control."* This can be seen from Trotsky, for
example, who argued in 1938 for *"workers' control . . . the penetration
of the workers' eye into all open and concealed springs of capitalist
economy . . . workers' control becomes a school for planned economy. On
the basis of the experience of control, the proletariat will prepare
itself for direct management of nationalised industry when the hour for
that eventuality strikes."* This, it is argued, proves that
nationalisation (state ownership and control) is not *"state
capitalism"* but rather *"control is the first step along the road to
the socialist guidance of economy."* [**The Death Agony of Capitalism
and the Tasks of the Fourth International**, p. 73 and p. 74] This
explains why many modern day Leninists are often heard voicing support
for what anarchists consider an obvious oxymoron, namely
*"nationalisation under workers' control."*

Anarchists are not convinced. This is because of two reasons. Firstly,
because by the term *"workers' control"* anarchists and Leninists mean
two radically different things. Secondly, when in **power** Trotsky
advocated radically different ideas. Based on these reasons, anarchists
view Leninist calls for *"workers' control"* simply as a means of
gaining popular support, calls which will be ignored once the real aim,
party power, has been achieved: it is an example of Trotsky's comment
that *"[s]logans as well as organisational forms should be subordinated
to the indices of the movement."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 72] In other words,
rather than express a commitment to the ideas of worker's control of
production, mainstream Marxist use of the term *"workers' control"* is
simply an opportunistic technique aiming at securing support for the
party's seizure of power and once this is achieved it will be cast aside
in favour of the first part of the demands, namely state ownership and
so control. In making this claim anarchists feel they have more than
enough evidence, evidence which many members of Leninist parties simply
know nothing about.

We will look first at the question of terminology. Anarchists
traditionally used the term *"workers' control"* to mean workers' full
and direct control over their workplaces, and their work. However, after
the Russian Revolution a certain ambiguity arose in using that term.
This is because specific demands which were raised during that
revolution were translated into English as *"workers' control"* when, in
fact, the Russian meaning of the word (**kontrolia**) was far closer to
*"supervision"* or *"steering."* Thus the term *"workers' control"* is
used to describe two radically different concepts.

This can be seen from Trotsky when he argued that the workers should
*"demand resumption, as public utilities, of work in private businesses
closed as a result of the crisis. Workers' control in such case would be
replaced by direct workers' management."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 73] Why
workers' employed in open capitalist firms were not considered suitable
for *"direct workers' management"* is not explained, but the fact
remains Trotsky clearly differentiated between management and control.
For him, *"workers' control"* meant *"workers supervision"* over the
capitalist who retained power. Thus the *"slogan of workers’ control of
production"* was not equated to actual workers’ control over production.
Rather, it was *"a sort of economic dual power"* which meant that
*"ownership and right of disposition remain in the hands of the
capitalists."* This was because it was *"obvious that the power is not
yet in the hands of the proletariat, otherwise we would have not
workers' control of production but the control of production by the
workers' state as an introduction to a regime of state production on the
foundations of nationalisation."* [Trotsky, **The Struggle Against
Fascism in Germany**, p. 91 and p. 92]

This vision of *"workers' control"* as simply supervision of the
capitalist managers and a prelude to state control and, ultimately,
nationalisation can be found in Lenin. Rather than seeing *"workers'
control"* as workers managing production directly, he always saw it in
terms of workers' *"controlling"* those who did. It simply meant *"the
country-wide, all-embracing, omnipresent, most precise and most
conscientious **accounting** of the production and distribution of
goods."* He clarified what he meant, arguing for *"country-wide,
all-embracing workers' control over the capitalists"* who would still
manage production. Significantly, he considered that *"as much as
nine-tenths of the **socialist** apparatus"* required for this
*"country-wide **book-keeping,** country-wide **accounting** of the
production and distribution of goods"* would be achieved by
nationalising the *"big banks,"* which *"**are** the 'state apparatus'
which we **need** to bring about socialism"* (indeed, this was
considered *"something in the nature of the **skeleton** of socialist
society"*). This structure would be taken intact from capitalism for
*"the modern state possesses an apparatus which has extremely close
connection with the banks and [business] syndicates . . . this apparatus
must not, and should not, be smashed."* [**Collected Works**, vol. 26,
p. 105, p. 107, p. 106 and pp. 105-6] Over time, this system would move
towards full socialism.

Thus, what Leninists mean by *"workers' control"* is radically different
than what anarchists traditionally meant by that term (indeed, it was
radically different from the workers' definition, as can be seen from a
resolution of the Bolshevik dominated First Trade Union Congress which
complained that *"the workers misunderstand and falsely interpret
workers' control."* [quoted by M. Brinton, **The Bolsheviks and Workers'
Control**, p. 32]). It is for this reason that from the 1960s English
speaking anarchists and other libertarian socialists have been explicit
and have used the term *"workers' self-management"* rather than
*"workers' control"* to describe their aims. Mainstream Marxists,
however have continued to use the latter slogan, undoubtedly, as we note
in [section H.3.5](secH3.html#sech35), to gain members from the
confusion in meanings.

Secondly, there is the example of the Russian Revolution itself. As
historian S.A. Smith correctly summarises, the Bolshevik party *"had no
position on the question of workers' control prior to 1917."* The
*"factory committees launched the slogan of workers' control of
production quite independently of the Bolshevik party. It was not until
May that the party began to take it up."* However, Lenin used *"the term
['workers' control'] in a very different sense from that of the factory
committees."* In fact Lenin's proposals were *"thoroughly statist and
centralist in character, whereas the practice of the factory committees
was essentially local and autonomous."* While those Bolsheviks
*"connected with the factory committees assigned responsibility for
workers' control of production chiefly to the committees"* this *"never
became official Bolshevik party policy."* In fact, *"the Bolsheviks
never deviated before or after October from a commitment to a statist,
centralised solution to economic disorder. The disagreement between the
two wings of the socialist movement [i.e., the Mensheviks and
Bolsheviks] was not about state control in the abstract, but what
**kind** of state should co-ordinate control of the economy: a bourgeois
state or a workers' state?"* They *"did not disagree radically in the
specific measures which they advocated for control of the economy."*
Lenin *"never developed a conception of workers' self-management. Even
after October, workers' control remained for him fundamentally a matter
of 'inspection' and 'accounting' . . . rather than as being necessary to
the transformation of the process of production by the direct producers.
For Lenin, the transformation of capitalist relations of production was
achieved at central-state level, rather than at enterprise level.
Progress to socialism was guaranteed by the character of the state and
achieved through policies by the central state - not by the degree of
power exercised by workers on the shop floor."* [**Red Petrograd**, p.
153, p. 154, p. 159, p. 153, p. 154 and p. 228]

Thus the Bolshevik vision of *"workers' control"* was always placed in a
statist context and it would be exercised not by workers' organisations
but rather by state capitalist institutions. This has nothing in common
with control by the workers themselves and their own class organisations
as advocated by anarchists. In May 1917, Lenin was arguing for the
*"establishment of state control over all banks, and their amalgamation
into a single central bank; also control over the insurance agencies and
big capitalist syndicates."* [**Collected Works**, vol. 24, p. 311] He
reiterated this framework later that year, arguing that *"the new means
of control have been created **not** by us, but by capitalism in its
military-imperialist stage"* and so *"the proletariat takes its weapons
from capitalism and does not 'invent' or 'create them out of nothing.'"*
The aim was *"compulsory amalgamation in associations under state
control,"* *"by workers' control of the **workers' state**."* [**Op.
Cit.**, vol. 26, p. 108, p. 109 and p. 108] The factory committees were
added to this *"state capitalist"* system but they played only a very
minor role in it. Indeed, this system of state control was designed to
limit the power of the factory committees:

> *"One of the first decrees issues by the Bolshevik Government was the
> Decree on Workers' Control of 27 November 1917. By this decree
> workers' control was institutionalised . . . Workers' control implied
> the persistence of private ownership of the means of production,
> though with a 'diminished' right of disposal. The organs of workers'
> control, the factory committees, were not supposed to evolve into
> workers' management organs after the nationalisation of the factories.
> The hierarchical structure of factory work was not questioned by Lenin
> . . . To the Bolshevik leadership the transfer of power to the working
> class meant power to its leadership, i.e. to the party. Central
> control was the main goal of the Bolshevik leadership. The hasty
> creation of the VSNKh (the Supreme Council of the National Economy) on
> 1 December 1917, with precise tasks in the economic field, was a
> significant indication of fact that decentralised management was not
> among the projects of the party, and that the Bolsheviks intended to
> counterpoise central direction of the economy to the possible
> evolution of workers' control toward self-management."* [Silvana
> Malle, **The Economic Organisation of War Communism, 1918-1921**, p.
> 47]

Once in power, the Bolsheviks soon turned away from even this limited
vision of workers' control and in favour of *"one-man management."*
Lenin raised this idea in late April 1918 and it involved granting state
appointed *"individual executives dictatorial powers (or 'unlimited'
powers)."* Large-scale industry required *"thousands subordinating their
will to the will of one,"* and so the revolution *"demands"* that *"the
people unquestioningly obey the single will of the leaders of labour."*
Lenin's *"superior forms of labour discipline"* were simply
hyper-developed capitalist forms. The role of workers in production was
the same, but with a novel twist, namely *"unquestioning obedience to
the orders of individual representatives of the Soviet government during
the work."* This support for wage slavery was combined with support for
capitalist management techniques. *"We must raise the question of
piece-work and apply and test it in practice,"* argued Lenin, *"we must
raise the question of applying much of what is scientific and
progressive in the Taylor system; we must make wages correspond to the
total amount of goods turned out."* [Lenin, **Op. Cit.**, vol. 27, p.
267, p. 269, p. 271 and p. 258]

This vision had already been applied in practice, with the *"first
decree on the management of nationalised enterprises in March 1918"*
which had *"established two directors at the head of each enterprise . .
. Both directors were appointed by the central administrators."* An
*"economic and administrative council"* was also created in the
workplace, but this *"did not reflect a syndicalist concept of
management."* Rather it included representatives of the employees,
employers, engineers, trade unions, the local soviets, co-operatives,
the local economic councils and peasants. This composition *"weakened
the impact of the factory workers on decision-making . . . The workers'
control organs [the factory committees] remained in a subordinate
position with respect to the council."* Once the Civil War broke out in
May 1918, this process was accelerated. By 1920, most workplaces were
under one-man management and the Communist Party at its Ninth Congress
had *"promoted one-man management as the most suitable form of
management."* [Malle, **Op. Cit.**, p. 111, p. 112, p. 141 and p. 128]
In other words, the manner in which Lenin organised industry had handed
it over entirely into the hands of the bureaucracy.

Trotsky did not disagree with all this, quite the reverse - he
wholeheartedly defended the imposing of *"one-man management"*. As he
put it in 1920, *"our Party Congress . . . expressed itself in favour of
the principle of one-man management in the administration of industry .
. . It would be the greatest possible mistake, however, to consider this
decision as a blow to the independence of the working class. The
independence of the workers is determined and measured not by whether
three workers or one are placed at the head of a factory."* As such, it
*"would consequently be a most crying error to confuse the question as
to the supremacy of the proletariat with the question of boards of
workers at the head of factories. The dictatorship of the proletariat is
expressed in the abolition of private property in the means of
production, in the supremacy over the whole Soviet mechanism of the
collective will of the workers, and not at all in the form in which
individual economic enterprises are administered."* The term
*"collective will of the workers"* is simply a euphemism for the Party
which Trotsky had admitted had *"substituted"* its dictatorship for that
of the Soviets (indeed, *"there is nothing accidental"* in this
*"'substitution' of the power of the party for the power of the working
class"* and *"in reality there is no substitution at all."* The
*"dictatorship of the Soviets became possible only by means of the
dictatorship of the party"*). The unions *"should discipline the workers
and teach them to place the interests of production above their own
needs and demands."* He even argued that *"the only solution to economic
difficulties from the point of view of both principle and of practice is
to treat the population of the whole country as the reservoir of the
necessary labour power . . . and to introduce strict order into the work
of its registration, mobilisation and utilisation."* [**Terrorism and
Communism**, p. 162, p. 109, p. 143 and p. 135]

Trotsky did not consider this a result of the Civil War. Again, the
opposite was the case: *"I consider if the civil war had not plundered
our economic organs of all that was strongest, most independent, most
endowed with initiative, we should undoubtedly have entered the path of
one-man management in the sphere of economic administration much sooner
and much less painfully."* [**Op. Cit.**, pp. 162-3] Significantly,
discussing developments in Russia since the N.E.P, Trotsky a few years
later argued that it was *"necessary for each state-owned factory, with
its technical director and with its commercial director, to be subjected
not only to control from the top - by the state organs - but also from
below, by the market which will remain the regulator of the state
economy for a long time to come."* Workers' control, as can be seen, was
not even mentioned, nor considered as an essential aspect of control
*"from below."* As Trotsky also stated that *"[u]nder socialism economic
life will be directed in a centralised manner,"* our discussion of the
state capitalist nature of mainstream Marxism we presented in the [last
section](secH3.html#sech313) is confirmed. [**The First Five Years of
the Communist International**, vol. 2, p. 237 and p. 229]

The contrast between what Trotsky did when he was in power and what he
argued for after he had been expelled is obvious. Indeed, the arguments
of 1938 and 1920 are in direct contradiction to each other. Needless to
say, Leninists and Trotskyists today are fonder of quoting Trotsky and
Lenin when they did not have state power rather than when they did.
Rather than compare what they said to what they did, they simply repeat
ambiguous slogans which meant radically different things to Lenin and
Trotsky than to the workers' who thrust them into power. For obvious
reasons, we feel. Given the opportunity for latter day Leninists to
exercise power, we wonder if a similar process would occur again? Who
would be willing to take that chance?

As such, any claim that mainstream Marxism considers *"workers'
control"* as an essential feature of its politics is simply nonsense.
For a comprehensive discussion of *"workers' control"* during the
Russian Revolution Maurice Brinton's account cannot be bettered. As he
stressed, *"only the ignorant or those willing to be deceived can still
kid themselves into believing that proletarian power **at the point of
production** was ever a fundamental tenet or objective of Bolshevism."*
[**The Bolsheviks and Workers' Control**, p. 14]

All this is not some academic point. As Brinton noted, faced *"with the
bureaucratic monstrosity of Stalinist and post-Stalinist Russia, yet
wishing to retain some credibility among their working class supporters,
various strands of Bolshevism have sought posthumously to rehabilitate
the concept of 'workers' control.'"* The facts show that between 1917
and 1921 *"all attempts by the working class to assert real power over
production - or to transcend the narrow role allocated by to it by the
Party - were smashed by the Bolsheviks, after first having been
denounced as anarchist or anarcho-syndicalist deviations. Today workers'
control is presented as a sort of sugar coating to the pill of
nationalisation of every Trotskyist or Leninist micro-bureaucrat on the
make. Those who strangled the viable infant are now hawking the corpse
around "* [**For Workers' Power**, p. 165] Little has changes since
Brinton wrote those words in the 1960s, with Leninists today proclaiming
with a straight face that they stand for "self-management"!

The roots of this confusion can be found in Marx and Engels. In the
struggle between authentic socialism (i.e. workers' self-management) and
state capitalism (i.e. state ownership) there **are** elements of the
correct solution to be found in their ideas, namely their support for
co-operatives. For example, Marx praised the efforts made within the
Paris Commune to create co-operatives, so *"transforming the means of
production, land and capital . . . into mere instruments of free and
associated labour."* He argued that *"[i]f co-operative production is
not to remain a shame and a snare; if it is to supersede the Capitalist
system; if united co-operative societies are to regulate national
production upon a common plan, thus taking it under their own control,
and putting an end to the constant anarchy and periodical convulsions
which are the fatality of Capitalist production - what else . . . would
it be but Communism, 'possible' Communism?"* [**Selected Works**, pp.
290-1] In the 1880s, Engels suggested as a reform the putting of public
works and state-owned land into the hands of workers' co-operatives
rather than capitalists. [**Collected Works**, vol. 47, p. 239]

These comments should not be taken as being totally without aspects of
nationalisation. Engels argued for *"the transfer - initially on lease -
of large estates to autonomous co-operatives under state management and
effected in such a way that the State retains ownership of the land."*
He stated that neither he nor Marx *"ever doubted that, in the course of
transition to a wholly communist economy, widespread use would have to
be made of co-operative management as an intermediate stage. Only it
will mean so organising things that society, i.e. initially the State,
retains ownership of the means of production and thus prevents the
particular interests of the co-operatives from taking precedence over
those of society as a whole."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 389] However, Engels
comments simply bring home the impossibilities of trying to reconcile
state ownership and workers' self-management. While the advocacy of
co-operatives is a positive step forward from the statist arguments of
the **Communist Manifesto**, Engels squeezes these libertarian forms of
organising production into typically statist structures. How
*"autonomous co-operatives"* can co-exist with (and under!) *"state
management"* and *"ownership"* is not explained, not to mention the
fatal confusion of socialisation with nationalisation.

In addition, the differences between the comments of Marx and Engels are
obvious. While Marx talks of *"united co-operative societies,"* Engels
talks of *"the State."* The former implies a free federation of
co-operatives, the latter a centralised structure which the
co-operatives are squeezed into and under. The former is socialist, the
latter is state capitalist. From Engels argument, it is obvious that the
stress is on state ownership and management rather than self-management.
This confusion became a source of tragedy during the Russian Revolution
when the workers, like their comrades during the Commune, started to
form a federation of factory committees while the Bolsheviks squeezed
these bodies into a system of state control which was designed to
marginalise them.

Moreover, the aims of the Paris workers were at odds with the vision of
the **Communist Manifesto** and in line with anarchism - most obviously
Proudhon's demands for workers associations to replace wage labour and
what he called, in his **Principle of Federation**, an *"agro-industrial
federation."* Thus the Commune's idea of co-operative production was a
clear expression of what Proudhon explicitly called *"industrial
democracy,"* a *"reorganisation of industry, under the jurisdiction of
all those who compose it."* [quoted by K. Steven Vincent,
**Pierre-Joseph Proudhon and the Rise of French Republican Socialism**,
p. 225] Thus, while Engels (in part) echoes Proudhon's ideas, he does
not go fully towards a self-managed system of co-operation and
co-ordination based on the workers' own organisations. Significantly,
Bakunin and later anarchists simply developed these ideas to their
logical conclusion.

Marx, to his credit, supported these libertarian visions when applied in
practice by the Paris workers during the Commune and promptly revised
his ideas. This fact has been obscured somewhat by Engels historical
revisionism in this matter. In his 1891 introduction to Marx's *"The
Civil War in France"*, Engels painted a picture of Proudhon being
opposed to association (except for large-scale industry) and stressed
that *"to combine all these associations in one great union"* was *"the
direct opposite of the Proudhon doctrine"* and so *"the Commune was the
grave of the Proudhon doctrine."* [**Selected Works**, p. 256] However,
as noted, this is nonsense. The forming of workers' associations and
their federation was a key aspect of Proudhon's ideas and so the
Communards were obviously acting in his spirit. Given that the
**Communist Manifesto** stressed state ownership and failed to mention
co-operatives at all, the claim that the Commune acted in its spirit
seems a tad optimistic. He also argued that the *"economic measures"* of
the Commune were driven not by *"principles"* but by *"simple, practical
needs."* This meant that *"the confiscation of shut-down factories and
workshops and handing them over to workers' associations"* were *"not at
all in accordance with the spirit of Proudhonism but certainly in
accordance with the spirit of German scientific socialism"*! This seems
unlikely, given Proudhon's well known and long-standing advocacy of
co-operatives as well as Marx's comment in 1866 that in France the
workers (*"particularly those of Paris"*!) *"are strongly attached,
without knowing it [!], to the old rubbish"* and that the *"Parisian
gentlemen had their heads full of the emptiest Proudhonist phrases."*
[Marx, Engels, Lenin, **Anarchism and Anarcho-Syndicalism**, p. 92, p.
46 and p. 45]

What did this *"old rubbish"* consist of? Well, in 1869 the delegate of
the Parisian Construction Workers' Trade Union argued that
*"[a]ssociation of the different corporations [labour
unions/associations] on the basis of town or country . . . leads to the
commune of the future . . . Government is replaced by the assembled
councils of the trade bodies, and by a committee of their respective
delegates."* In addition, *"a local grouping which allows the workers in
the same area to liase on a day to day basis"* and *"a linking up of the
various localities, fields, regions, etc."* (i.e. international trade or
industrial union federations) would ensure that *"labour organises for
present and future by doing away with wage slavery."* This *"mode of
organisation leads to the labour representation of the future."* [**No
Gods, No Masters**, vol. 1, p. 184]

To state the obvious, this had clear links with both Proudhon's ideas
**and** what the Commune did in practice. Rather than being the
*"grave"* of Proudhon's ideas on workers' associations, the Commune saw
their birth, i.e. their application. Rather than the Parisian workers
becoming Marxists without knowing it, Marx had become a follower of
Proudhon! The idea of socialism being based on a federation of workers'
associations was not buried with the Paris Commune. It was integrated
into all forms of social anarchism (including communist-anarchism and
anarcho-syndicalism) and recreated every time there is a social
revolution.

In ending we must note that anarchists are well aware that individual
workplaces could pursue aims at odds with the rest of society (to use
Engels expression, their *"particular interests"*). This is often termed
*"localism."* Anarchists, however, argue that the mainstream Marxist
solution is worse than the problem. By placing self-managed workplaces
under state control (or ownership) they become subject to even worse
*"particular interests,"* namely those of the state bureaucracy who will
use their power to further their own interests. In contrast, anarchists
advocate federations of self-managed workplaces to solve this problem.
This is because the problem of *"localism"* and any other problems faced
by a social revolution will be solved in the interests of the working
class only if working class people solve them themselves. For this to
happen it requires working class people to manage their own affairs
directly and that implies self-managed organising from the bottom up
(i.e. anarchism) rather than delegating power to a minority at the top,
to a "revolutionary" party or state. This applies economically, socially
and politically. As Bakunin argued, the *"revolution should not only be
made for the people's sake; it should also be made by the people."*
[**No Gods, No Masters**, vol. 1, p. 141]
