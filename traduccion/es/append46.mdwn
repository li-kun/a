Why does the Makhnovist movement show there is an alternative to Bolshevism?
============================================================================

The key Leninist defence of the actions of the Bolsheviks in the Russian
revolution is that they had no other choice. Complaints against the
Bolshevik attacks on the gains of the revolution and the
pro-revolutionary Left in Russia are met with a mantra involving the
white terror, the primitive state of Russia and the reactionary
peasantry, the invading imperialist armies (although the actual number
can, and does, vary depending on who you are talking to) and other such
*"forces of nature"* which we are to believe could only be met by a
centralised authoritarian regime that would flinch at nothing in order
to survive.

However, this is not the case. This is for three reasons.

Firstly, there is the slight problem that many of the attacks on the
revolution (disbanding soviets, undermining the factory committees,
repressing socialists and anarchists, and so on) started **before** the
start of the civil war. As such, its difficult to blame the degeneration
of the revolution on an event which had yet to happen (see [section
3](append43.html#app3) of the appendix ["What caused the degeneration of
the Russian Revolution?"](append43.html) for details).

Secondly, Leninists like to portray their ideology as "realistic," that
it recognises the problems facing a revolution and can provide the
necessary solutions. Some even claim, flying in the face of the facts,
that anarchists think the ruling class will just *"disappear"* (see
[section H.2.1](secH2.html#sech21) ) or that we think *"full-blown"*
communism will appear *"overnight"* (see [section
H.2.5](secH2.html#sech25)). Only Bolshevism, it is claimed, recognises
that civil war is inevitable during a revolution and only it provides
the necessary solution, namely a *"workers state."* Lenin himself argued
that *"[n]ot a single great revolution in history has escaped civil war.
No one who does not live in a shell could imagine that civil war is
conceivable without exceptionally complicated circumstances."* [**Will
the Bolsheviks Maintain Power?**, p. 81] As such, its incredulous that
modern day followers of Lenin blame the degeneration of the Russian
Revolution on the very factors (civil war and exceptional circumstances)
that they claim to recognise an inevitable!

Thirdly, and even more embarrassingly for the Leninists, numerous
examples exist both from revolutionary Russia at the time and from
earlier and later revolutions that suggest far from Bolshevik tactics
being the most efficient way of defending the revolution other methods
existed which looked to the massive creative energies of the working
masses unleashed by the revolution.

During the Russian Revolution the biggest example of this is found in
South-Eastern Ukraine. For much of the Civil War this area operated
without a centralised state apparatus of the Bolshevik type and was,
instead, based on the anarchist idea of Free Soviets. There *"the
insurgents raised the black flag of anarchism and set forth on the
anti-authoritarian road of the free organisation of the workers."*
[Arshinov, **The History of the Makhnovist Movement**, p. 50] The space
in which this happened was created by a partisan force that instead of
using the *"efficiency"* of executions for desertion, tsarist officers
appointed over the rank and file soldiers' wishes and saluting so loved
by the Bolsheviks instead operated as a volunteer army with elected
officers and voluntary discipline. This movement was the Makhnovists,
named after its leader, the Ukrainian anarchist Nestor Makhno. The Black
Flag which floated over the lead wagon of the Insurgent Army was
inscribed with the slogans ***"Liberty or Death"*** and ***"The Land to
the Peasants, the Factories to the Workers."*** These slogans summarised
what the Makhnovist were fighting for -- a libertarian socialist
society. At its height in the autumn of 1919, the Maknovists numbered
around 40,000 and its extended area of influence corresponded to nearly
one third of the Ukrainian Soviet Republic, comprising a population of
over seven million.

It is this that explains the importance of the Makhnovists. As historian
Christopher Reed notes, the *"Bolsheviks' main claim to legitimacy
rested on the argument that they were the only ones capable of
preventing a similar disaster [counter-revolution] for the workers and
peasants of Russia and that their harsh methods were necessary in the
face of a ruthless and unrelenting enemy."* However, Reed argues that
*"the Makhno movement in the Ukraine suggests that there was more than
one way to fight against the counter-revolution."* [**From Tsar to
Soviets**, pp. 258-9] This is why the Makhnovist movement is so
important, why it shows that there was, and is, an alternative to the
ideas of Bolshevism. Here we have a mass movement operating in the same
*"exceptional circumstances"* as the Bolsheviks which did **not**
implement the same policies. Indeed, rather than suppress soviet,
workplace and military democracy in favour of centralised, top-down
party power and modify their political line to justify their
implementation of party dictatorship, the Makhnovists did all they could
to implement and encourage working-class self-government.

As such, it is difficult to blame the development of Bolshevik policies
towards state-capitalist and party-dictatorship directions on the
problems caused during the revolution when the Makhnovists, facing
similar conditions, did all they could to protect working- class
autonomy and freedom. Indeed, it could be argued that the problems
facing the Makhnovists were greater in many ways. The Ukraine probably
saw more fighting in the Russian Civil War then any other area. Unlike
the Bolsheviks, the Makhnovists lost the centre of their movement and
had to re-liberate it. To do so they fought the Austrian and German
armies, Ukrainian Nationalists, Bolsheviks and the White Armies of
Denikin and then Wrangel. There were smaller skirmishes involving
Cossacks returning to the Don and independent *"Green"* bands. The
anarchists fought all these various armies over the four years their
movement was in existence. This war was not only bloody but saw constant
shifts of fronts, advances and retreats and changes from near
conventional war to mobile partisan war. The consequences of this was
that no area of the territory was a safe *"rear"* area for any period of
time and so little constructive activity was possible. [Section
4](append46.html#app4) presents a summary of the military campaigns of
these years. A brief idea of the depth of fighting in these years can be
seen by considering the town at the centre of the Makhnovists, Hulyai
Pole which changed hands no less then 16 times in the period from
1917-1921.

Clearly, in terms of conflict (and the resulting disruption caused by
it), the Makhnovists did not have the relative peace the Bolsheviks had
(who never once lost their main bases of Petrograd or Moscow, although
they came close). As such, the problems used to justify the repressive
and dictatorial policies of the Bolsheviks also apply to the
Makhnovists. Despite this, the activity of the Makhnovists in the
Ukraine demonstrated that an alternative to the supposedly necessary
methods of the Bolsheviks did exist. Where the Bolsheviks suppressed
freedom of speech, assembly and press, the Makhnovists encouraged it.
Where the Bolsheviks turned the soviets into mere cyphers of their
government and undermined soviet power, the Makhnovists encouraged
working-class participation and free soviets. As we discuss in [section
7](append46.html#app7), the Makhnovists applied their ideas of working
class self-management whenever and wherever they could.

Sadly, the Makhnovist movement is a relatively unknown event during the
revolution. There are few non-anarchist accounts of it and the few
histories which do mention it often simply slander it. However, as the
Cohn-Bendit brothers correctly argue, the movement, *"better perhaps
than any other movement, shows that the Russian Revolution could have
been a great liberating force."* Equally, the reason why it has been
almost totally ignored (or slandered, when mentioned) by Stalinist and
Trotskyist writers is simple: *"It shows the Bolsheviks stifling workers
and peasants with lies and calumnies, and then crushing them in a bloody
massacre."* [Daniel and Gabriel Cohn-Bendit, **Obsolete Communism: The
Left-Wing Alternative**, p. 200]

This section of our FAQ will indicate the nature and history of this
important social movement. As we will prove, *"the Makhnovshchina . . .
was a true popular movement of peasants and workers, and . . . its
essential goal was to establish the freedom of workers by means of
revolutionary self-activity on the part of the masses."* [Arshinov,
**The History of the Makhnovist Movement**, p. 209] They achieved this
goal in extremely difficult circumstances and resisted all attempts to
limit the freedom of the working class, no matter where it came from. As
Makhno himself once noted:

> *"Our practice in the Ukraine showed clearly that the peasant problem
> had very different solutions from those imposed by Bolshevism. If our
> experience had spread to the rest of Russia, a pernicious division
> between country and city would not have been created. Years of famine

> Russian Revolution."* [quoted by Abel Paz, **Durruti: The People
> Armed**, p. 88-9]

Two distinct aspects of the anarchist movement existed in the Ukraine at
this time, a political and non-military structure called the Nabat
(Alarm) federation which operated through the soviets and collectives
and a military command structure usually known after is commander Nestor
Makhno as the ***Makhnovshchina* (which means the *"Makhno movement"*)
although its proper name was the ***Revolutionary Insurgent Army of the
Ukraine*. This section of the FAQ will cover both, although the
Makhnovshchina will be the main focus.****

For more information on the Makhnovist movement, consult the following
books. Anarchist accounts of the movement can be found in Peter
Arshinov's excellent **The History of the Makhnovist Movement** and
Voline's **The Unknown Revolution** (Voline's work is based on extensive
quotes from Arshinov's work, but does contain useful additional
material). For non-anarchist accounts, Michael Malet's **Nestor Makhno
in the Russian Revolution** is essential reading as it contains useful
information on both the history of the movement, its social basis and
political ideas. Malet considers his work as a supplement to Michael
Palij's **The Anarchism of Nestor Makhno, 1918-1921** which is primarily
a military account of the movement but which does cover some of its
social and political aspects. Unfortunately, both books are rare. Paul
Avrich's **The Russian Anarchists** contains a short account of the
movement and his **Anarchist Portraits** has a chapter on Nestor Makhno.
Makhnovist source material is included in Avrich's **The Anarchists in
the Russian Revolution**. Daniel Guerin includes a section on Makhno and
the Makhnovist Movement in volume 2 of **No Gods, No Masters**. As well
as extracts from Arshinov's book, it has various manifestos from the
movement as well as Makhno's account of his meeting with Lenin.
Christopher Read's **From Tsar to Soviets** has an excellent section on
the Makhnovists. Serge Cipko presents an excellent overview of works on
the Makhnovists in his *"Nestor Makhno: A Mini-Historiography of the
Anarchist Revolution in Ukraine, 1917-1921"* (**The Raven**, no. 13).
Alexander Skirda presents an overview of perestroika soviet accounts of
Makhno in his essay *"The Rehabilitation of Makhno"* (**The Raven**, no.
8). Skirda's biography **Nestor Makhno: Le Cosaque de l'anarchie** is by
far the best account of the movement available.

Lastly, a few words on names. There is a large variation on the spelling
of names within the source material. For example, Makhno's home town has
been translated as Gulyai Pole, Gulyai Polye Huliai-Pole and Hulyai
Pole. Similarly, with other place names. The bandit Grigor'ev has been
also translated as Hryhor'iv and Hryhoriyiv. We generally take Michael
Malet's translations of names as a basis (i.e. we use Hulyai Pole and
Hryhoriyiv, for example).

1 Who was Nestor Makhno?
------------------------

The Makhnovist movement was named after Nestor Makhno, a Ukrainian
anarchist who played a key role in the movement from the start. Indeed,
Makhnoshchina literally means *"Makhno movement"* and his name is
forever linked with the revolution in the South-East of the Ukraine. So
who was Makhno?

Nestor Ivanovich Makhno was born on the 27th of October, 1889 in Hulyai
Pole, which is situated in Katerynoslav province, in the south east of
the Ukraine between the Dnieper River and the Sea of Azov. While it
seems to be conventional for many historians to call Hulyai Pole a
"village," it was in fact a town with a population of about 30,000 and
boasted several factories and schools.

Makhno was the son of a poor peasant family. His father died when he was
ten months old, leaving him and his four brothers in the care of their
mother. Due to the extreme poverty of his family, he had to start work
as a shepherd at the age of seven. At eight he started to attend the
Second Hulyai Pole primary school in winter and worked for local
landlords during the summer. He left school when he was twelve and took
up full-time employment as a farmhand on the estates of nobles and on
the farms of the German colonist **kulaks.** At the age of seventeen, he
started to work in Hulyai Pole itself, first as an apprentice painter,
then as an unskilled worker in a local iron foundry and, finally, as a
founder in the same establishment.

It was when he was working in the iron foundry that he became involved
in revolutionary politics. In the stormy years following the 1905
revolution, Makhno got involved in revolutionary politics. This decision
was based on his experiences of injustice at work and seeing the terror
of the Russian regime during the 1905 events (in Hulyai Pole there had
been no serious disorder, yet the regime sent a detachment of mounted
police to suppress gatherings and meetings in the town, terrorising the
population by whipping those caught in the streets and beating prisoners
with rifle butts). In 1906, Makhno decided to join the anarchist group
in Hulyai Pole (which had been formed the previous year and consisted
mainly of sons of poorer peasants).

At the end of 1906 and in 1907, Makhno was arrested and accused of
political assassinations, but was released due to lack of evidence. In
1908, due to the denunciation of a police spy within the anarchist
group, he was arrested and put in jail. In March, 1910, Makhno and
thirteen others were tried by a military court and sentenced to death by
hanging. Due to his youth and the efforts of his mother, the death
penalty was commuted to life imprisonment with hard labour. He served
his time at the Butyrki prison in Moscow, resisting the prison
authorities by every means available to him. Due to this resistance, he
spent much of his time in chains or in damp and freezing confinement.
This experience ensured that Makhno developed an intense hatred of
prisons (later, during the revolution, his first act in entering a town
or city was to release all prisoners and destroy the prison).

It was during his time in Butykri that Makhno met Peter Arshinov, a
fellow anarchist prisoner and later activist and historian of the
Makhnovist movement. Arshinov was born in 1887 in the Ukrainian
industrial town of Katerinoslav. His father was a factory worker and he
was a metal worker. Originally a Bolshevik, he had become an anarchist
in 1906, taking a leading part in organising factory workers and actions
against the regime. In 1907 he was arrested and sentenced to death,
escaping to Western Europe. In 1909, he returned to Russia and was again
arrested and again escaped. In 1910, he was arrested and placed in the
Butykri prison where he met Makhno. The two anarchists established a
close personal and political friendship, with Arshinov helping Makhno
develop and deepen his anarchist ideas.

On March 2nd, 1917, after eight years and eight months in prison, Makhno
was released along with all other political prisoners as a result of the
February Revolution. After spending three weeks in Moscow with the
Moscow anarchists, Makhno returned to Hulyai Pole. As the only political
prisoner who was returned to his family by the revolution, Makhno became
very well-respected in his home town. After years of imprisonment,
suffering but learning, Makhno was no longer an inexperienced young
activist, but a tested anarchist militant with both a powerful will and
strong ideas about social conflict and revolutionary politics. Ideas
which he immediately set about applying.

Once home in Hulyai Pole, Makhno immediately devoted himself to
revolutionary work. Unsurprisingly, the remaining members of the
anarchist group, as well as many peasants, came to visit him. After
discussing ideas with them, Makhno proposed beginning organisational
work immediately in order to strengthen links between the peasants in
Hulyai Pole and its region with the anarchist group. On March 28-29, a
Peasant Union was created with Makhno as its chairman. Subsequently, he
organised similar unions in other villages and towns in the area. Makhno
also played a large part in a successful strike by wood and metal
workers at a factory owned by his old boss (this defeat led to the other
bosses capitulating to the workers as well). At the same time, peasants
refused to pay their rent to the landlords. [Michael Malet, **Nestor
Makhno in the Russian Civil War**, p. 4] Regional assemblies of peasants
were called, both at Hulyai Pole and elsewhere, and on August 5-7, the
provincial congress at Katerinoslav decided to reorganise the Peasant
Unions into Soviets of Peasants' and Workers' Deputies.

In this way, *"Makhno and his associates brought socio-political issues
into the daily life of the people, who in turn supported his efforts,
hoping to expedite the expropriation of large estates."* [Michael Palij,
**The Anarchism of Nestor Makhno**, p. 71] In Hulyai Pole, the
revolution was moving faster than elsewhere (for example, while the
Aleksandrovsk soviet supported the actions of the Provisional Government
during the July days in Petrograd, a meeting in Hulyai Pole saluted the
rebellious soldiers and workers). Peasants were drawn to Hulyai Pole for
advice and help from the neighbouring **volosts** (administrative
districts). The peasantry wanted to seize the land of the large
landowners and the kulaks (rich peasants). Makhno presented this demand
at the first sessions of the regional Soviet, which were held in Hulyai
Pole. In August, Makhno called all the local landlords and rich peasants
(kulaks) together and all documents concerning ownership (of land,
livestock and equipment) were taken from them. An inventory of this
property was taken and reported to the session of the local soviet and
then at a regional meeting. It was agreed that all land, livestock and
equipment was to be divided equally, the division to include the former
owners. This was the core of the agrarian program of the movement,
namely the liquidation of the property of the landowners and kulaks.
No-one could own more land than they could work with their own labour.
All this was in flat defiance to the Provisional Government which was
insisting that all such questions be left to the Constituent Assembly.
Free communes were also created on ex-landlord estates.

Unsurprisingly, the implementation of these decisions was delayed
because of the opposition of the landlords and kulaks, who organised
themselves and appealed to the provisional authorities. When General
Kornilov tried to march on Petrograd and take power, the Hulyai Pole
soviet took the initiative and formed a local *"Committee for the
Salvation of the Revolution"* headed by Makhno. The real aim was to
disarm the potential local enemy -- the landlords, bourgeoisie, and
kulaks -- as well as to expropriate their ownership of the people's
wealth: the land, factories, plants, printing shops, theatres and so on.
On 25 September a volost congress of Soviets and peasant organisations
in Hulyai Pole proclaimed the confiscation of the landowners' land and
its transformation into social property. Raids on the estates of
landlords and rich peasants, including German colonists, began and the
expropriation of the expropriators began.

Makhno's activities came to a halt the following spring when Lenin's
government signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. This treaty gave sizeable
parts of the Russian Empire, including the Ukraine, to Germany and
Austria in return for peace. The Treaty also saw the invasion of the
Ukraine by large numbers of German and Austrian troops, who conquered
the entire country in less than three months. Makhno succeeded in
forming several military units, consisting of 1700 men, but could not
stop Hulyai Pole being taken. After an anarchist congress at the end of
April in Taganrog, it was decided to organise small combat units of five
to ten peasants and workers, to collect arms from the enemy and to
prepare for a general peasant uprising against the Austro-German troops
and, finally, to send a small group to Soviet Russia to see at first
hand what was happening there to both the revolution and to the
anarchists under Bolshevik rule. Makhno was part of that group.

By June, Makhno had arrived in Moscow. He immediately visited a number
of Russian anarchists (including his old friend Peter Arshinov). The
anarchist movement in Moscow was cowed, due to a Cheka raid in April
which broke the backbone of the movement, so ending a political threat
to the Bolsheviks from the left. To Makhno, coming from an area where
freedom of speech and organisation was taken for granted, the low level
of activity came as a shock. He regarded Moscow as the capital of the
*"paper revolution,"* whose red tape and meaninglessness had affected
even the anarchists. Makhno also visited Peter Kropotkin, asking his
advice on revolutionary work and the situation in the Ukraine. To
Makhno, *"Moscow appeared as 'the capital of the Paper Revolution,' a
vast factory turning out empty resolutions and slogans while one
political party, by means of force and fraud, elevated itself into the
position of a ruling class."* [David Footman, **Op. Cit.**, p. 252]

While in Moscow, Makhno met with Lenin. This meeting came about by
chance. Visiting the Kremlin to obtain a permit for free board and
lodging, he met the chairman of the All-Russian Central Executive
Committee of the Soviets, Jakov M. Sverdlov, who arranged for Makhno to
meet Lenin. Lenin asked Makhno, *"How did the peasants of your region
understand the slogan ALL POWER TO THE SOVIETS IN THE VILLAGES?"* Makhno
states that Lenin *"was astonished"* at his reply:

> *"The peasants understood this slogan in their own way. According to
> their interpretation, all power, in all areas of life, must be
> identified with the consciousness and will of the working people. The
> peasants understand that the soviets of workers and peasants of
> village, country and district are neither more nor less than the means
> of revolutionary organisation and economic self-management of working
> people in the struggle against the bourgeoisie and its lackeys, the
> Right socialists and their coalition government."*

To this Lenin replied: *"Well, then, the peasants of your region are
infected with anarchism!"* [Nestor Makhno, **My Visit to the Kremlin**,
p. 18] Later in the interview, Lenin stated: *"Do the anarchists ever
recognise their lack of realism in present-day life? Why, they don't
even think of it."* Makhno replied:

> *"But I must tell you, comrade Lenin, that your assertion that the
> anarchists don't understand 'the present' realistically, that they
> have no real connection with it and so forth, is fundamentally
> mistaken. The anarchist-communists in the Ukraine . . . the

Lenin replied: *"Perhaps I am mistaken."* [Makhno, **Op. Cit.**, pp.
24-5]

The Bolsheviks helped Makhno to return to the Ukraine. The trip was
accomplished with great difficulty. Once Makhno was almost killed. He
was arrested by Austro-German troops and was carrying libertarian
pamphlets at the time. A Jewish inhabitant of Hulyai Pole, who had know
Makhno for some time, succeeded in saving him by paying a considerable
sum of money for his liberation. Once back in Hulyai-Pole, he started to
organise resistance to the occupying forces of the Austro-Germans and
their puppet regime led by Hetman Skoropadsky. With the resistance, the
Makhno movement can be said to have arisen (see [section
3](append46.html#app3) on way it was named after Makhno). From July 1918
to August 1921, Makhno led the struggle for working class freedom
against all oppressors, whether Bolshevik, White or Nationalist. During
the course of this struggle, he proved himself to be *"a guerrilla
leader of quite outstanding ability."* [David Footman, **Civil War in
Russia**, p. 245] The military history of this movement is discussed in
[section 4](append46.html#app4), while other aspects of the movement are
discussed in other sections.

After the defeat of the Makhnovist movement in 1921, Makhno was exiled
in Western Europe. In 1925 he ended up in Paris, where he lived for the
rest of his life. While there, he remained active in the anarchist
movement, with the pen replacing the sabre (to use Alexander Skirda's
colourful expression). Makhno contributed articles to various anarchist
journals and in particular to **Delo Truda**, an anarchist-communist
paper started in Paris by Peter Arshinov (many of these articles have
been published in the book **The Struggle Against the State and Other
Essays**). He remained active in the anarchist movement to the end.

In Paris, Makhno met the famous Spanish anarchists Buenaventura Durruti
and Francisco Ascaso in 1927. He argued that in Spain *"conditions for a
revolution with a strong anarchist content are better than in Russia"*
because not only was there *"a proletariat and a peasantry with a
revolutionary tradition whose political maturity is shown in its
reactions,"* the Spanish anarchists had *"a sense of organisation which
we lacked in Russia. It is organisation which assures the success in
depth of all revolutions."* Makhno recounted the activities of the
Hulyai Pole anarchist group and the events in revolutionary Ukraine:

> *"Our agrarian commune was at once the economic and political vital
> centre of our social system. These communities were not based on
> individual egoism but rested on principles of communal, local and
> regional solidarity. In the same way that the members of a community
> felt solidarity among themselves, the communities were federated with
> each other . . . It is said against our system that in the Ukraine,
> that it was able to last because it was based only on peasant
> foundations. It isn't true. Our communities were mixed,
> agricultural-industrial, and, even, some of them were only industrial.
> We were all fighters and workers. The popular assembly made the
> decisions. In military life it was the War Committee composed of
> delegates of all the guerrilla detachments which acted. To sum up,
> everyone took part in the collective work, to prevent the birth of a
> managing class which would monopolise power. And we were successful."*
> [quoted by Abel Paz, **Durruti: The People Armed**, p. 88-9]

As can be seen from the social revolution in Aragon, Durruti took
Makhno's advice seriously (see [section I.8](secI8.html) for more on the
Spanish Revolution). Unsurprisingly, in 1936 a number of veterans of
Makhno's Insurgent Army went to fight in the Durruti column. Sadly,
Makhno's death in 1934 prevented his own concluding statement to the two
Spaniards: *"Makhno has never refused to fight. If I am alive when you
start your struggle, I will be with you."* [quoted by Paz, **Op. Cit.**,
p. 90]

Makhno's most famous activity in exile was his association with, and
defence of, the **Organisational Platform of the Libertarian
Communists** (known as the *"Platform"*). As discussed in [section
J.3.3](secJ3.html#secj33), the Platform was an attempt to analyse what
had gone wrong in the Russian Revolution and suggested a much tighter
anarchist organisation in future. This idea provoked intense debate
after its publication, with the majority of anarchists rejecting it (for
Makhno's discussion with Malatesta on this issue, see **The Anarchist
Revolution** published by Freedom Press). This debate often resulted in
bitter polemics and left Makhno somewhat isolated as some of his
friends, like Voline, opposed the Platform. However, he remained an
anarchist to his death in 1934.

Makhno died on the morning of July 25th and was cremated three days
later and his ashes placed in an urn within Pere Lachaise, the cemetery
of the Paris Commune. Five hundred Russian, French, Spanish and Italian
comrades attended the funeral, at which the French anarchist Benar and
Voline spoke (Voline used the occasion to refute Bolshevik allegations
of anti-Semitism). Makhno's wife, Halyna, was too overcome to speak.

So ended the life of one great fighters for working-class freedom.
Little wonder Durruti's words to Makhno:

> *"We have come to salute you, the symbol of all those revolutionaries
> who struggled for the realisation of Anarchist ideas in Russia. We
> also come to pay our respects to the rich experience of the Ukraine."*
> [quoted by Abel Paz, **Op. Cit.**, p. 88]

For fuller details of Makhno's life, see the accounts by Peter Arshinov
(**The History of the Makhnovist Movement**), Paul Avrich (*"Nestor
Makhno: The Man and the Myth,"* in **Anarchist Portraits**), Michael
Palij, (**The Anarchism of Nestor Makhno**) and Michael Malet (**Nestor
Makhno in the Russian Revolution**).

2 Why was the movement named after Makhno?
------------------------------------------

Officially, the Makhnovist movement was called the **Revolutionary
Insurrectionary Army of the Ukraine**. In practice, it was usually
called the *"Makhno movement"* (***"Makhnovshchina"*** in Russian) or
the Makhnovists. Unsurprisingly, Trotsky placed great significance on
this:

> *"The anti-popular character of the Makhno movement is most clearly
> revealed in the fact that the army of Hulyai Pole is actually called
> 'Makhno's Army'. **There, armed men are united not around a programme,
> not around an ideological banner, but around a man.**"* [**The Makhno
> Movement**]

Ignoring the irony of a self-proclaimed Marxist (and later Leninist and
founder of Trotskyism!) making such a comment, we can only indicate why
the Makhnovists called themselves by that name:

> *"Because, first, in the terrible days of reaction in the Ukraine, we
> saw in our ranks an unfailing friend and leader, MAKHNO, whose voice
> of protest against any kind of coercion of the working people rang out
> in all the Ukraine, calling for a battle against all oppressors,
> pillagers and political charlatans who betray us; and who is now
> marching together with us in our common ranks unwavering toward the
> final goal: liberation of the working people from any kind of
> oppression."* [contained in Arshinov, **Op. Cit.**, p. 272]

The two of the anarchists who took part in the movement and later wrote
its history concur. Voline argues that the reason why the movement was
known as the *"Makhnovist movement"* was because the *"most important
role in this work of unification [of the peasant masses] and in the
general development of the revolutionary insurrection in the southern
Ukraine was performed by the detachment of partisans guided by a peasant
native to the region: Nestor Makhno."* [**The Unknown Revolution**, p.
551] *"From the first days of the movement,"* Arshinov notes, *"up to
its culminating point, when the peasants vanquished the landowners,
Makhno played a preponderant and central role to such an extent that the
whole insurgent region and the most heroic moments of the struggle are
linked to his name. Later, when the insurrection had triumphed
completely over the Skoropadsky counter-revolution and the region was
threatened by Denikin, Makhno became the rallying point for millions of
peasants in several regions."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 50]

It must be stressed that Nestor Mahkno was not the boss of the
Mahknovista. He was not their ruler or general. As such, the fact that
the Makhnovists were (unofficially) named after Makhno does not imply
that it was his personal fiefdom, nor that those involved followed him
as an individual. Rather, the movement was named after him because he
was universally respected within it as a leading militant. This fact
also explains why Makhno was nicknamed *"Batko"* (see [next
section](append46.html#app3)).

This can be seen from how the movement was organised and was run. As we
discuss in [section 5](append46.html#app5), it was organised in a
fundamentally democratic way, by means of mass assemblies of insurgents,
elected officers, regular insurgent, peasant and worker congresses and
an elected *"Revolutionary Military Soviet."* The driving force in the
Makhnovist movement was not, therefore, Makhno but rather the anarchist
ideas of self-management. As Trotsky himself was aware, the Makhnovists
were influenced by anarchist ideas:

> *"Makhno and his companions-in-arms are not non-party people at all.
> They are all of the Anarchist persuasion, and send out circulars and
> letters summoning Anarchists to Hulyai Pole so as to organise their
> own Anarchist power there."* [Trotsky, **Op. Cit.**]

As part of this support for anarchist theory, the Makhnovists organised
insurgent, peasant and worker conferences to discuss key issues in the
revolution and the activities of the Makhno movement itself. Three such
conferences had been before Trotsky wrote his diatribe **The Makhno
Movement** on June 2nd, 1919. A fourth one was called for June 15th,
which Trotsky promptly banned (on pain of death) on June 4th (see
[section 13](append46.html#app13) for full details). Unlike the
Bolshevik dictatorship, the Makhnovists took every possibility of
ensuring the participation of the working people they were fighting for
in the revolution. The calling of congresses by the Makhnovists shows
clearly that the movement did not, as Trotsky asserted, follow a man,
but rather ideas.

As Voline argued, *"the movement would have existed without Makhno,
since the living forces, the living masses who created and developed the
movement, and who brought Makhno forward merely as their talented
military leader, would have existed without Makhno."* Ultimately, the
term *"Makhnovshchina"* is used *"to describe a unique, completely
original and independent revolutionary movement of the working class
which gradually becomes conscious of itself and steps out on the broad
arena of historical activity."* [*"preface,"* Arshinov, **Op. Cit.**, p.
19]

3 Why was Makhno called *"Batko"*?
----------------------------------

Nestor Makhno was often called in the movement *"Batko"*, which is
Ukrainian for *"father."* Peter Arshinov explains how and in what
circumstances Makhno was given this name:

> *"It was . . . in September 1918, that Makhno received the nickname
> **Batko** -- general leader of the revolutionary insurrection in the
> Ukraine. This took place in the following circumstances. Local
> **pomeshchiks** [landed gentry] in the major centres, the **kulaks**
> [rich peasants], and the German authorities [the Ukraine being
> occupied by them at the time], decided to eliminate Makhno and his
> detachment [of partisans] at any cost. The **pomeshchiks** created a
> special volunteer detachment consisting of their own sons and those of
> **kulaks** for the decisive struggle against Makhno. On the 30th of
> September this detachment, with the help of the Austro-Germans, corned
> Makhno in the region of Bol'shaya Mihhailovka, setting up strong
> military posts on all roads. At this time Makhno found himself with
> only 30 partisans and one machine gun. He was forced to make a
> fighting retreat, manoeuvring in the midst of numerous enemy forces.
> Arriving in the forest of Dibrivki, Makhno found himself in an
> extremely difficult situation. The paths of retreat were occupied by
> the enemy. It was impossible for the detachment to break through, and
> escaping individually was beneath their revolutionary dignity. No-one
> in the detachment would agree to abandon their leader so as to save
> himself. After some reflection, two days later, Makhno decided to
> return to the village of Bol'shaya Mikhailovka (Dibrivki). Leaving the
> forest the partisans met peasants who came to warn them that there
> were large enemy forces in Dibrivki and that they should make haste to
> go elsewhere. This information did not stop Makhno and his partisans .
> . . [and] they set out for Bol'shaya Mikhailovka. They approached the
> village guardedly. Makhno himself and a few of his comrades went on
> reconnaissance and saw a large enemy camp on the church square, dozens
> of machine guns, hundreds of saddle horses, and groups of cavalry.
> Peasants informed them that a battalion of Austrians and a special
> **pomeshchik** detachment were in the village. Retreat was impossible.
> Then Makhno, with his usual stubbornness and determination, said to
> his companions: 'Well, my friends! We should all be ready to die on
> this spot . . .' The movement was ominous, the men were firm and full
> of enthusiasm. All 30 saw only one path before them -- the path toward
> the enemy, who had about a thousand well-armed men, and they all
> realised that this meant certain death for them. All were moved, but
> none lost courage.*
>
> "It was at this movement that one of the partisans, Shchus', turned to
> Makhno and said:
>
> "'From now on you will be **Batko** to all of us, and we vow to die
> with you in the ranks of the insurgents.'
>
> "Then the whole detachment swore never to abandon the insurgent ranks,
> and to consider Makhno the general **Batko** of the entire
> revolutionary insurrection. Then they prepared to attack. Shchus' with
> five to seven men was assigned to attack the flank of the enemy.
> Makhno with the others attacked from the front. With a ferocious

> in groups and individually, abandoning arms, machine guns and horses.
> Without leaving them time to come to themselves, to become aware of

> The enemy's defeat was complete.
>
> "Local peasants and detachments of revolutionary insurgents came from
> all directions to triumphantly acclaim the heroes. They unanimously
> agreed to consider Makhno as **Batko** of the entire revolutionary
> insurrection in the Urkaine." [Arshinov, **Op. Cit.**, pp. 59-60]

This was how Makhno acquired the nickname *"Batko,"* which stuck to him
thereafter.

It should be stressed that *"Batko"* was a nickname and did not signify
any form of autocratic or hierarchical position within the movement:

> *"During the civil war, it signified the leadership and control of a
> specific area and its population in both civil and military fields.
> The central point of the use of the word, rather than 'leader' or
> 'dictator' is that the leadership is usually based on respect, as in
> Makhno's case, and always on intimate knowledge of the home
> territory."* [Michael Malet, **Op. Cit.**, p. 17]

That this was a nickname can be seen from the fact that *"[a]fter 1920
he was usually called 'Malyi' ('Shorty'), a nickname referring to his
short stature, which was introduced by chance by one of the
insurgents."* [Peter Arshinov, **Op. Cit.**, p. 226] To attach
significance to the fact that the peasants called Makhno *"Batko"* (as
the Bolsheviks did) simply signifies an ignorance of the Makhnovist
movement and its social environment.

4 Can you give a short overview of the Makhnovist movement?
-----------------------------------------------------------

This section of the FAQ gives a short overview of the Makhnovists from
July 1918 (when Makhno returned to the Ukraine) and August 1921, when it
was finally defeated by Bolshevik armed force. It will be primarily a
military history, with the socio-political aspects of the movement
discussed in sections [6](append46.html#app6) (its theory) and
[7](append46.html#app7) (its practice). For details of the rise of
influence of Makhno after his release from prison in 1917, see [section
1](append46.html#app1).

The history of the Makhno movement can be broken up into roughly four
periods -- from July 1918 to February 1919, then the rest of 1919, then
January to October 1920 and, finally, from October 1920 to August 1921.
This section will give an overview of each period in turn.

By the time Makhno arrived back in the Ukraine in July, 1918, opposition
to the German-backed Hetman's regime was mounting and was frequently met
with brutal repression, including reprisal executions. Makhno was forced
to live underground and on the move, secretly meeting with others, with
the Austrians always close behind. Voline recounts Makhno's activities
at this time:

> *"Back in Hulyai Pole, Makhno came to the decision to die or obtain
> victory for the peasants . . . He did not delay starting his mission
> openly among the great masses of peasants, speaking at improvised
> meetings, writing and distributing letters and tracts. By pen and
> mouth, he called on the peasants for a decisive struggle against the
> power of Skoropadsky and the landlords. He declared tirelessly that
> the workers should now take their fates into their own hands and not
> let their freedom to act be taken from them . . .*
>
> "Besides his appeals, Makhno proceeded immediately to direct action.
> His first concern was to form a revolutionary military unit,
> sufficiently strong to guarantee freedom of propaganda and action in
> the villages and towns and at the same time to begin guerrilla
> operations. This unit was quickly organised .. . .
>
> "His first unit undertook two urgent tasks, namely, pursuing
> energetically the work of propaganda and organisation among the
> peasants and carrying out a stubborn armed struggle against all their
> enemies. The guiding principle of this merciless struggle was as
> follows. No lord who persecuted the peasants, no policeman of the
> Hetman, no Russian or German officer who was an implacable enemy of
> the peasants, deserved any pity; he must be destroyed. All who
> participated in the oppression of the poor peasants and workers, all
> who sought to suppress their rights, to exploit their labour, should
> be executed.
>
> "Within two or three weeks, the unit had already become the terror,
> not only of the local bourgeoisie, but also of the Austro-German
> authorities." [**The Unknown Revolution**, p. 558]

The night of 26 September saw Hulyai Pole briefly liberated from Hetman
and Austrian troops by the actions of Makhno's troops in association
with local people. On the retreat from this Makhno's small band grew
when he met the partisan troops headed by Schus. When the Austrians
cornered them, they launched a surprise counter attack and routed the
opposition. This became known as the battle of Dibrivki and it is from
this date, 5 October 1918 that Makhno is given the nickname 'Batko',
meaning *"father"* (see [section 3](append46.html#app3) for details).
For the next two months already- existing partisan groups sought out and
joined the growing army.

In this period, Makhno, with portable printing equipment, was raiding
the occupying garrisons and troop trains in the Southern Ukraine. Normal
practice was to execute the officers and free the troops. In this period
the moral of the occupying troops had crumbled and revolutionary
propaganda had made inroads into many units. This was also affecting the
nationalist troops and on 20 November the first nationalist unit
defected to the Makhnovists. This encouraged them to return to Hulyai
Pole on 27 December and there the insurrectionary Staff was formed, this
body was to lead the army in the coming years and consisted initially of
four old and trusted friends and three political comrades. The
Makhnovist presence allowed the setting up of a local soviet and the
re-opening of the anarchist clubs. German forces started pulling back to
the major cities and on December 14 the Hetman fled Kiyiv. In the
resulting vacuum, the Makhnovists rapidly expanded taking in most of the
South East Ukraine and setting up fronts against local whites. The
Ukrainian nationalists had taken power in the rest of the Ukraine under
Petliura and on the 15th December the Makhnovists agreed to make common
cause with them against the Whites. In return for arms and ammunition
they allowed the nationalists to mobilise in the Makhnovist area (while
engaging in propaganda directed at the mobilised troops on their way by
train to Katerynoslav).

This was a temporary and pragmatic arrangement directed against the
greater enemy of the Whites. However, the nationalists were no friends
of working-class autonomy. The nationalists banned elections to the
Katerynoslav soviet on 6th of December and the provincial soviet at
Kharkiv meet with a similar fate on the 22nd. [Malet, **Op. Cit.**, p.
22] At the same time as their agreement with the nationalists, the
Makhnovista had set up links with Bolshevik partisans to the south and
before dawn on the 26th the Bolshevik and Makhnovista forces launched a
joint attack on the nationalists at Katerynoslav. The city was taken but
held only briefly when a nationalist attack on the 29th drove out all
the insurgent forces with heavy losses. In the south, White
reinforcements led to the insurgents being pushed North and losing
Hulyai Pole.

1919 opened with the Makhnovists organising a congress of front- unit
delegates to discuss the progress of the struggle. Over forty delegates
attended and a committee of five was elected, along with an operational
staff to take charge of the southern front and its rear. It was agreed
that local soviets were to be supported in every way, with no military
violence directed towards them permitted. [Malet, **Op. Cit.**, p. 25]

By the end of January, white reinforcements were landing in the ports of
the south. On January 22nd, a worker, peasant and insurgent congress was
held at Velyka Mykhailivka. A resolution was passed urging an end to
conflict between Makhnovists, Nationalists and Bolsheviks. An alliance
was signed between the Makhnovists and the Bolsheviks in early February.
This agreement ensured that the Partisan units entered the Red Army as
distinct formations, with their internal organisation (including the
election of commanders) intact, and the Red Army in the area formed a
brigade to be known as *"the third Transdnieper Batko Makhno brigade"*
with Makhno as commander. The Whites were repulsed and Hulyai Pole
retaken and the front pushed some distance eastwards.

Thus the military situation had improved by the time of the second
worker, peasant and insurgent congress held at Hulyai Pole on February
12th. This congress set up a *"Revolutionary Military Soviet"* to
co-ordinate civilian affairs and execute its decisions. The congress
resolved that *"the land belongs to nobody"* and should be cultivated
without the use of hired labour. It also accepted a resolution opposing
anti-Jewish pogroms. Also passed was a resolution which sharply attacked
the Bolsheviks, caused by their behaviour since their arrival in the
Ukraine. [Palij, **Op. Cit.**, pp. 154-5] A report by the commander of
the 2nd Red Army, Skatchco, indicates the nature of this behaviour:

> *"Little local Chekas are undertaking a relentless campaign against
> the Makhnovists, even when they are shedding their blood at the front.
> They are hunting them down from the rear and persecuting them solely
> for belonging to the Makhnovist movement . . . It cannot continue like
> this: the activity of the local Chekas is deliberately ruining the
> front, reducing all military successes to nothing, and contributing to
> the creation of a counter-revolution that neither Denikin nor Krasnov
> [Hetman of the Don Cossacks] could have achieved. . ."* [quoted by
> Alexander Skirda, **The Rehabilitation of Makhno**, p. 346]

Unsurprisingly, the peasants reacted strongly to the Bolshevik regime.
Their *"agricultural policy and terrorism"* ensured that *"by the middle
of 1919, all peasants, rich and poor, distrusted the Bolsheviks."*
[Palij, **Op. Cit.**, p. 156] In April alone, there were 93 separate
armed rebellions against the Bolsheviks in the Ukraine. The *"more
oppressive the Bolshevik policy, the more the peasants supported Makhno.
Consequently, the Bolsheviks began to organise more systematically
against the Makhno movement, both as an ideology and as a social
movement."* [Palij, **Op. Cit.**, p. 157]

In mid-March the Red Army attacked eastwards. In the course of this
Dybenko, commander of the Trandneiper division, recommended one of
Makhno's commanders for a medal. Then the Makhnovists attacked the
Donbas (east) to relieve the pressure on the Soviet 8th Army caused by a
White advance. They took Mariupol following a White incursion at the
beginning of April. A White counter-offensive resulted in the Red 9th
division panicking, allowing the Whites into Makhno's rear. Red
Commander Dybenko refused orders to come to the Makhnovists aid as he
was more interested in the Crimea (south). [Malet, **Op. Cit.**, p. 31]

This period saw the most sustained freedom for the region around Hulyai
Pole. It had been free of enemy occupation since January, allowing
constructive activity to restart. The inhabitants of the free region
*"created new forms of social organisation: free workers' communes and
Soviets."* [Voline, **Op. Cit.**, p. 574] The Revolutionary Military
Soviet (RMS) called a third regional worker, peasant and insurgent
congresses had on April 10th to review progress and to look forward.
This was the largest congress to date, with delegates from 72 volosts
containing two million people. The Bolshevik military commander Dybenko
tried to ban it. The Makhnovists, needless to say, ignored him and the
RMS made a famous reply to his arrogance (see [section
13](append46.html#app13) for more details).

It was during this period (late 1918 and early 1919), that the
***Nabat*** anarchist federation was organised. *"Anarchist influence
was reported from Aleksandrovsk and other centres,"* notes David
Footman, *"Anarchists were holding a conference in Kursk at about the
same time and in one of their resolutions it was stated that 'the
Ukrainian Revolution will have great chances of rapidly becoming
Anarchist in its ideas.' The position called for renewed Bolshevik
measures against the Anarchists. **Nabat**, the main Anarchist newspaper
in the Ukraine, was suppressed, and its editorial board dispersed under
threat of arrest."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 270] Daniel Guerin has reproduced
two documents from the Nabat federation in volume II of his **No Gods,
No Masters**.

The anarchist influence in and around Hulyai Pole also worried the
Bolsheviks. They started a slander campaign against the Makhnovists, to
the alarm of Antonov, the overall front commander, who replied in
response to an article in Kharkiv Izvestiya:

> *"The article is the most perverted fiction and does not in the least
> correspond to the existing situation. The insurgents fighting the
> whites are on a level with the Red Army men, but are in a far worse
> condition for supplies."* [quoted by Malet, **Op. Cit.**, p. 33]

In a postscript, Antonov added that the press campaign had certainly
helped turn Makhno anti-Soviet (i.e. anti-Bolshevik, as Makhno supported
free soviets).

At the beginning of May, another partisan commander, Hryhoriyiv,
revolted against the Bolsheviks in the central Ukraine. Hryhoriyiv, like
the Makhnovists, had joined with the Bolsheviks when they had re-entered
the Ukraine, however his social and political background was totally
different. Hryhoriyiv was a former Tsarist officer, who had commanded
numerous troops under the Petliurist authority and joined the Bolsheviks
once that that regime's armed forces had disintegrated. Arshinov notes
that he had *"never been a revolutionary"* and that there had been a
*"great deal of adventurism in his joining the ranks of the Petliurists
and then the ranks of the Red Army."* His temperament was mixed,
consisting of *"a certain amount of sympathy for oppressed peasants,
authoritarianism, the extravagance of a Cossack chieftain, nationalist
sentiments and anti-Semitism."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 110]

Hryhoriyov started his revolt by issuing a Universal, or declaration to
the Ukrainian people, which contained a virulent attack on the
Bolsheviks as well as one explicit anti-Semitic reference, but without
mention of Makhno. The height of the revolt was his appearance in the
suburbs of Katerynoslav, which he was stopped from taking. He started a
pogrom in Yelyzavethrad which claimed three thousand victims.

Once the Makhnovists had been informed of this rebellion, an enlarged
staff and RMS meeting was held. A telegram was sent to the soldiers at
the front urging them to hold the front and another to the Bolsheviks
with a similar message. A few days latter, when more information had
been received, a proclamation was issued against Hyyhoriyiv attacking
him for seeking to impose a new authority on the working class, for
encouraging toiling people to attack each other, and for inciting
pogroms. [Arshinov, **Op. Cit.**, p. 112 and pp. 114-7]

While it took a fortnight for Red forces to contain Hryhoriyiv without
trouble, this involved using all available reverses of all three
Ukrainian armies. This left none for Makhno's hard-pressed forces at the
front. In addition, Dybenko withdrew a front-line regiment from Makhno
for use against the revolt and diverted reinforcements from the Crimea
which were intended for Makhno. Despite this Makhnos forces (now
numbering 20,000) were ordered to resume the attack on the whites. This
was due to *"unremitting pressure from Moscow to take Taganrog and
Rostov."* [Malet, **Op. Cit.**, p. 36] The Makhnovist advance stopped
due to the non-fulfilment of an urgent order for ammunition.

On the 19th of May, a White counter-attack not only stopped the advance
of the Red Army, it forced the 9th division (and then the Makhnovists)
to retreat. On the 29th, the Whites launched a further offensive against
the northern Donblas, opening a gap between the 13th and 8th Red Armies.
Due to the gravity of the situation, the RSV summoned a fourth congress
for June 15th. Trotsky not only banned this congress but took the lead
in slandering the Makhnovists and calling for their elimination (see
[section 13](append46.html#app13) for details). As well as *"this
deliberately false agitational campaign, the [Bolshevik] blockade of the
region was carried to the limit . . . The provisioning of shells,
cartridges and other indispensable equipment which was used by daily at
the front, ceased completely."* [Arshinov, **Op. Cit.**, p. 118] Palij
confirms this, noting that *"the supplies of arms and other war material
to Makhno was stopped, thus weakening the Makhno forces vis-a-vis the
Denikin troops."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 175] David Footman also notes that
the Bolshevik *"hold-back of supplies for the Insurgents developed into
a blockade of the area. Makhnovite units at the front ran short of
ammunition."* He also mentions that *"[i]n the latter part of May the
**Cheka** sent over two agents to assassinate Makhno."* [**Civil War in
Russia**, p. 271]

Needless to say, Trotsky blamed this White success to the Makhnovists,
arguing it was retreating constantly before even the slightest attack by
the Whites. However, this was not the case. Analysing these events in
July 1919, Antonov (the commander of the Southern Front before Trotsky
replaced him) wrote:

> *"Above all, the facts witness that the affirmations about the
> weakness of the most contaminated region -- that from Hulyai Pole to
> Berdiansk -- are without foundation . . . It is not because we
> ourselves have been better organised militarily, but because those
> troops were directly defending their native place . . . Makhno stayed
> at the front, in spite of the flight of the neighbouring 9th division,
> following by the whole of the 13th army . . . The reasons for the
> defeat on the southern front do not rest at all in the existence of
> 'Ukrainian partisans' . . . above all it must be attributed to the
> machinery of the southern front, in not keeping its fighting spirit
> and reinforcing its revolutionary discipline."* [quoted by Alexander
> Skirda, **The Rehabilitation of Makhno**, p. 348]

This, incidentally, tallies with Arshinov's account that *"hordes of
Cossacks had overrun the region, **not through the insurrectionary front
but from the left flank where the Red Army was stationed.**"* [**Op.
Cit.**, p. 126] For what it is worth, General Denikin himself concurs
with this account of events, noting that by the 4th of June his forces
*"repulsed the routed and demoralised contingents of the Eight and
Thirteenth Soviet Armies . . . The resistance of the Thirteenth Army
being completely broken."* He notes that an attempt by the Fourteenth
Army (which Makhno's troops were part of) to attack on the flank came to
nothing. He only mentions Makhno when he recounts that *"General
Shkuro's division routed Makhno at Hulyai Pole."* [**The White Armies**,
p. 272] With Whites broken through on their flank and with limited
ammunition and other supplies (thanks to the Bolsheviks), the
Makhnovists had no choice but to retreat.

It was around this time that Trotsky, in a public meeting in Kharkov,
*"announced that it were better to permit the Whites to remain in the
Ukraine than to suffer Makhno. The presence of the Whites, he said,
would influence the Ukrainian peasantry in favour of the Soviet
Government, whereas Makhno and his **povstantsi**, would never make
peace with the Bolsheviki; they would attempt to possess themselves of
some territory and to practise their ideas, which would be a constant
menace to the Communist Government."* [Emma Goldman, **My
Disillusionment in Russia**, p. 63]

Due to this Bolshevik betrayal, the Makhnovist sector was in very grave
danger. At Hulyai Pole, a peasant regiment was scraped together in 24
hours in an attempt to save the town. It encountered White Cossacks ten
miles away from the town and was mown down. The Whites entered Hulyai
Pole the next day (June 6th) and gave it a good going over. On the same
day, the Bolsheviks issued an order for Makhno's arrest. Makhno was
warned and put in his resignation, arguing that it was *"an inviolable
right of the workers and peasants, a right won by the revolution, to
call congresses on their own account, to discuss their affairs."*
Combined with the *"hostile attitude"* of the Bolshevik authorities
towards him, which would lead *"unavoidably to the creation of a special
internal front,"* Makhno believed it was his duty to do what he could to
avert it, and so he left his post. [quoted by Arshinov, **Op. Cit.**, p.
129] While Makhno escaped, his staff was not so lucky. Five of them were
arrested the same day and shot as a result of Trotsky's order to ban the
fourth congress.

Leaving his troops in the frontline, Makhno left with a small cavalry
detachment. While leaving the rest under Red command, Makhno made a
secret agreement with his regimental commanders to await a message from
him to leave the Red Army and join up against with the partisans. On the
9th and 10th of June, Hulyai Pole was retaken by Bolshevik forces, who
took the opportunity to attack and sack the Makhnovist communes.
[Arshinov, **Op. Cit.**, p. 86f]

After intense fighting, the Whites finally split the Southern Front into
three on June 21st. Needless to say, Trotsky and the Bolsheviks blamed
this on the partisan forces (even stating that they had *"opened the
front"* to the Whites). This was nonsense, as noted above.

After leaving the front, Makhno took refuge in the Chorno-Znamenski
forest before continuing the retreat north and skirmishing with Red Army
units. This brought him into the territory held by Hryhoriyiv and this,
in turn, meant they had to proceed carefully. While the Makhnovists had
made a public denunciation of Hryhoriyiv, Makhno was approaching the
centre of Hryhoriyov's remaining influence. Surrounded by enemies,
Makhno had little choice but to begin discussions with Hryhoriyiv. This
was problematic to say the least. Hryhoriyiv's revolt had been tinged
with anti-Semitism and had seen at least one major pogrom. Being faced
with Hryhoriyov's anti-Semitism and his proposal for an alliance with
the Whites against the Reds led the Makhnovists to plot his downfall at
a meeting planned for the 27th July.

This meeting had originally been called to discuss the current tasks of
the insurgents in the Ukraine and was attended by nearly 20,000
insurgents and local peasants. Hryhoriyiv spoke first, arguing that the
most urgent task was to chase out the Bolsheviks and that they should
ally themselves with any anti-Red forces available (a clear reference to
the Whites under Denikin). The Makhnovist Chubenko spoke next, declaring
that the *"struggle against the Bolsheviks could be revolutionary only
if it were carried out in the name of the social revolution. An alliance
with the worst enemies of the people -- with generals -- could only be a
counter-revolutionary and criminal adventure."* Following him, Makhno
*"demanded before the entire congress"* that Hryhoriyiv *"immediately
answer for the appalling pogrom of Jews he had organised in Elisavetgrad
in May, 1919, as well as other anti-Semitic actions."* [Arshinov, **Op.
Cit.**, p. 136]

Seeing that things were going badly, Hryhoriyiv went for his revolver,
but was shot by a Makhnovist. Makhno finished him off. Makhnovist guards
disarmed the leading Hryhoriyivists. Then Makhno, Chubenko and others
justified the killing before the mass meeting, which approved the act
passing a resolution that stated that Hryhoriyiv's death was *"an
historical and necessary fact, for his policy, acts and aims were
counter-revolutionary and mainly directed to helping Denikin and other
counter-revolutionaries, as is proved by his Jewish pogroms."* [quoted
by Malet, **Op. Cit.**, p. 42] The troops under Hryhoriyiv became part
of the general Insurrectionary Army.

At the end of July, Makhno recalled the troops he had earlier left in
the Red Army and by mid-August the forces met up, becoming an army of
some 15,000. At Mykolaiv, the Red Army units were defecting to Makhno in
large numbers due in part to the feeling that the Red Army were
abandoning the defence of the Ukraine. This was the start of Denikin's
massive push north and Petliura's push east. By the end of August,
Makhno felt strong enough to go on the offensive against the Whites.
Superior White forces pushed the Makhnovists further and further west,
away from their home region. *"Denikin,"* in Voline's words, *"not only
made war on the army as such, but also on the whole peasant population.
In addition to the usual persecutions and beatings, the villages he
occupied were burnt and wrecked. The greater part of the peasants'
dwellings were looted and wrecked. Hundreds of peasants were shot. The
women maltreated, and nearly all the Jewish women . . . were raped."*
This repression *"obliged the inhabitants of the villages threatened by
the approach of the Denikinists to abandon their hearths and flee. Thus
the Makhnovist army was joined and followed in their retreat by
thousands of peaant families in flight from their homes with their
livestock and belongings. It was a veritable migration. An enormous mass
of men, women and children trailed after the army in its slow retreat
towards the west, a retreat which gradually extended over hundreds of
kilometres."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 607]

Meeting the Nationalists in mid-September, it was agreed on both sides
that fighting would only aid the Whites and so the Makhnovists entered a
non-aggression pact with Petliura. This enabled them to offload over
1,000 wounded. The Makhnovists continued their propaganda campaign
against the Nationalists, however. By the 24th of September,
intelligence reports suggested that White forces had appeared to the
west of their current position (i.e. where the Nationalists where). The
Makhnovists concluded that the only way this could have happened was if
the Nationalists had allowed the Whites to cross their territory (the
Nationalists disputed this, pointing to the fighting that had started
two days before between them and the Whites).

This meant that the Makhnovists were forced to fight the numerically
superior Whites. After two days of desperate fighting, the Whites were
routed and two regiments were destroyed at the battle of Peregonovka
village. Makhno's forces then conducted an incredibly rapid advance in
three directions helped by their mobile cart-transported infantry, in
three days smashing three reserve regiments and at the greatest point
advancing 235 miles east. On the 6th October a drive to the south
started which took key White ports and captured a huge quantity of
equipment including 600 trucks of British-supplied ammunition and an
aeroplane. This was disastrous for Denikin whose forces had reached the
northernmost point on their advance on Moscow, for these ports were key
for his supply routes. The advance continued, cutting the railway route
and so stopping all shells reaching Denikin's Moscow front.

Denikin was forced to send some of his best troops from the Moscow front
to drive back the Makhnovists and British boats were sent to towns on
the coast where Makhno might retreat through. The key city of
Katerinoslav was taken with the aid of a workers' uprising on November
9th and held for a month before the advancing Whites and a typhoid
epidemic which was to devastate the Makhnovista ranks by the end of the
year forced them out of the city. In December, the Red Army advance made
possible by Makhno's devastation of Denikin's supply lines continued.

Thus Voline:

> *"It is necessary to emphasise here the historic fact that the honour
> of having annihilated the Denikinist counter-revolution in the autumn
> of 1919, belongs entirely to the Makhnovist Insurrectionary Army. If
> the insurgents had not won the decisive victory of Peregonovka, and
> had not continued to sap the bases in Denikin's rear, destroying his
> supply service for artillery, food and ammunition, the Whites would
> probably have entered Moscow in December 1919 at the latest."* [**Op.
> Cit.**, p. 625]

In December the Red Army advance made possible by Makhno's devastation
of Denikin's supply lines continued. By early January the Reds had split
White forces into three and their troops had reached Katerynoslav. The
attitude of the Bolsheviks to the Makhnovists had already been decided.
On December 12th, 1919, Trotsky stated that when the two forces met, the
Bolsheviks had *"an order . . . from which we must not retreat one
single step."* While we discuss this secret order in more depth in
[section 13](append46.html#app13), we will note here that it gave
partisans the option of becoming *"fully subordinate to [Bolshevik]
command"* or *"be subjected to ruthless punishment."* [**How the
Revolution Armed**, vol. II., pp. 110-1 and p. 442] Another secret order
to the 45th division issued on January 4th instructed them to
*"annihilate Makhnovist bands"* and *"disarm the population."* The 41st
was sent *"into reserve"* to the Hulyai Pole region. This was *"five
days before Makhno was outlawed, and shows that the Bolshevik command
had a clear view of Makhno's future, even if the latter did not."*
[Malet, **Op. Cit.**, p. 54]

Unaware of this, the Makhnovista put out propaganda leaflets directed at
the Red Army rank and file, appealing to them as comrades. At
Aleksandrovsk on December 5th talks occurred between a representative of
the Makhnovists and the commander of the 45th division's 1st brigade.
These broke down when Makhno was ordered to the Polish front, which the
Makhnovists refused. On January 9th, Yegorov, commander of the Red Army
southern front, used this pretext to outlaw Makhno. This outlawing was
engineered deliberately by the Bolsheviks:

> *"The author of the order realised at that time there was no real war
> between the Poles and the Bolsheviks at that time and he also knew
> that Makhno would not abandon his region .. . . Uborevich [the author]
> explained that 'an appropriate reaction by Makhno to this order would
> give us the chance to have accurate grounds for our next steps' . . .
> [He] concluded: 'The order is a certain political manoeuvre and, at
> the very least, we expect positive results from Makhno's realisation
> of this.'"* [Palij, **Op. Cit.**, p. 210]

In addition, war with Poland did not break out until the end of April,
over three months later.

Needless to say, the Makhnovists **did** realise the political
motivations behind the order. As Arshinov notes, *"[s]ending the
insurrectionary army to the Polish front meant removing from the Ukraine
the main nerve centre of the revolutionary insurrection. This was
precisely what the Bolsheviks wanted: they would then be absolute
masters of the rebellious region, and the Makhnovists were perfectly
aware of this."* Moreover, the Makhnovists considered the move
*"physically impossible"* as *"half the men, the entire staff and the
commander himself were in hospital with typhus."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 163]

This was the signal for nine months of bitter fighting between the Red
Army and the Makhnovists. Military events in this period are confused,
with the Red Army claiming victory again and again, only for the
Makhnovists to appear somewhere else. Hulyai Pole changed hands on a
couple of occasions. The Bolsheviks did not use local troops in this
campaign, due to fear of fraternisation. In addition, they used *"new
tactics,"* and *"attacked not only Makhno's partisans, but also the
villages and towns in which the population was sympathetic toward
Makhno. They shot ordinary soldiers as well as their commanders,
destroying their houses, confiscating their properties and persecuting
their families. Moreover the Bolsheviks conducted mass arrests of
innocent peasants who were suspected of collaborating in some way with
the partisans. It is impossible to determine the casualties involved."*
They also set up *"Committees of the Poor"* as part of the Bolshevik
administrative apparatus, which acted as *"informers helping the
Bolshevik secret police in its persecution of the partisans, their
families and supporters, even to the extent of hunting down and
executing wounded partisans."* [Palij, **Op. Cit.**, pp. 212-3]

In addition to this suffering, the Bolshevik decision to attack Makhno
rather than push into the Crimea was also to prolong the civil war by
nine more months. The Whites re-organised themselves under General
Wrangel, who began a limited offensive in June. Indeed, the Bolshevik
*"policy of terror and exploitation turned almost all segments of
Ukrainian society against the Bolsheviks, substantially strengthened the
Makhno movement, and consequently facilitated the advance of the
reorganised anti-Bolshevik force of General Wrangel from the Crimea into
South Ukraine, the Makhno region."* [Palij, **Op. Cit.**, p. 214]

It was widely believed on the White side that Makhno was ready to
co-operate with them and, desperate for men, Wrangel decided to appeal
to the Makhnovists for an alliance. Their response was simple and
direct, they decided to immediately execute his delegate and publish
both his letter and a response in the Makhnovist paper *"The Road to
Freedom."* [Malet, **Op. Cit.**, p. 60] Of course, this did not stop the
Bolsheviks later claiming such an alliance existed!

Ironically enough, at a general assembly of insurgents, it was decided
that *"the destruction of Wrangel"* would *"eliminate a threat to the
revolution"* and so free *"all of Russia"* from *"the
counter-revolutionary barrage."* The mass of workers and peasants
*"urgently needed an end to all those wars"* and so they proposed *"to
the Communists that hostilities between them and the Makhnovists be
suspended in order that they might wipe out Wrangel. In July and August,
1920, telegrams to this effect were sent to Moscow and Kharkov."* There
was no reply and the Bolsheviks *"continued their war against the
Makhnovists, and they also continued their previous campaign of lies and
calumnies against them."* [Arshinov, **Op. Cit.**, p. 176]

In July and August the Makhnovists went on the offensive, raiding the
Bolsheviks in three provinces and attacking the Red Army infrastructure.
Wrangel began another offensive in September, driving the Red Army back
again and again and threatening the Makhnovist area. Faced with
Wrangel's success, the Bolsheviks started to rethink their position on
Makhno, although on the 24th of September the Bolshevik
commander-in-chief Kamenev was still declaring the need for *"the final
liquidation of the Makhno band."* [Malet, **Op. Cit.**, p. 62] A few
days later, the Bolsheviks changed their mind and negotiations began.

So, by October 1920, the success of the Wrangel offensive was again
forcing the Bolsheviks and Makhnovists to put aside their differences
and take on the common enemy. A deal was reached and on October 2nd,
Frunze, the new Red Army commander of the Southern Front, ordered a
cessation of hostilities against the Makhnovists. A statement from the
Soviet of the Revolutionary Insurgent Army of the Ukraine (Makhnovists)
explained the treaty as necessitated by the White offensive but also
representing a victory over the *"high-handed communists and
commissars"* in forcing them to recognise the *"free insurrection."*
[Malet, **Op. Cit.**, p. 64]

The agreement was signed between October 10th and 15th. It consisted of
two parts, a Political and a Military agreement (see [section
13](append46.html#app13) for full details). The Political agreement
simply gave the Makhnovists and anarchists the rights they should have
had according to the Soviet Constitution. The Military agreement
resulted in the Makhnovists becoming part of the Red Army, keeping their
established internal structure and, significantly, stopped them from
accepting into their ranks any Red Army detachments or deserters
therefrom. According to Bolshevik sources, *"there was never the
slightest intention on the Bolshevik side of keeping to the agreement
once its military value had passed."* [David Footman, **Op. Cit.**, p.
296]

Even before the agreement came into effect, the Makhnovists were
fighting alongside the Bolsheviks and between October 4 and 17, Hulyai
Pole was retaken by the Aleksandrovsk group, which included 10,000
Makhnovista. On October 22, Aleksandrovsk was taken with 4,000 white
prisoners and from then to early November the Makhnovists cut through
Wrangel's rear, hoping to cut off his retreat by seizing the Crimean
passes. The Whites fought a skilful rearguard which together with the
new White fortifications on the peninsula held up the advance. But by
the 11th, his hold in the Crimea gone, Wrangel had no choice but to
order a general retreat to the ports and an evacuation. Even the
Bolsheviks had to acknowledge that the *"Makhnovist units fulfilled
their military tasks with no less heroism than the Red Army units."*
[quoted by Malet, **Op. Cit.**, p. 69]

On hearing this success on 16th November, the reaction of the
Makhnovista still at Hulyai Pole was cynical but realistic: *"It's the
end of the agreement. I'll bet you anything that the Bolsheviks will be
on us within the week."* [quoted by Malet, **Op. Cit.**, p. 70] They
were not wrong. Already Frunze, the Red Army commander, had ordered two
entire cavalry armies to concentrate near Hulyai Pole at the same time
as he ordered the Makhnovist forces to the Caucasus Front! By 24th
November Frunze was preparing for the treachery to come, in Order 00149
(which was not sent to the Makhnovist units) saying if they had not
departed to the Caucasus front by the 26th *"the Red regiments of the
front, who have now finished with Wrangel, will start speaking a
different language to these Makhnovist youths."* [quoted by Malet, **Op.
Cit.**, p. 71]

Of course this treachery went right to the top, just before the 26th
*"deadline"* (which Makhno, not having seen the orders, was unaware of),
Lenin urged Rakovski, head of the Ukrainian government to *"[k]eep a
close watch on all anarchists and prepare documents of a criminal nature
as soon as possible, on the basis of which charges can be preferred
against them."* [quoted by Malet, **Op. Cit.**, p. 71] Indeed, it later
appeared the treachery had been prepared from at least 14th or 16th
November, as prisoners captured later stated they had received undated
anti-Makhnovist proclamations on that date. [Malet, **Ibid.**]

At 3am on the 26th the attacks on the Makhnovists started. Alongside
this one of the Makhnovist commanders was lured to a meeting by the
Bolsheviks, seized and shot. Some Makhnovist forces managed to break
through the encircling Bolsheviks but only after taking heavy losses --
of the 2,000-4,000 cavalry at Simferopol, only 250 escaped. By the 1st
December, Rakovsi reported the imminent demise of the Makhnovists to the
Kharkiv soviet only to have to eat his words when Makhno routed the 42nd
division on the 6th, retaking Hulyai Pole and 6,000 prisoners, of whom
2,000 joined his forces. [Malet, **Op. Cit.**, p. 72] Simultaneously
with the attack on the Makhnovists, the Bolsheviks rounded up all known
anarchists in the Ukraine (many of whom were in Kharkiv waiting for a
legally organised **Nabat** conference to begin).

In the resulting struggle between the two forces, as Palij notes, the
*"support of the population was a significant advantage to Makhno, for
they supplied the partisans with needed material, including horses and
food, while the Red troops operated among a foreign and hostile
people."* The Bolsheviks found that the peasants not only refused to
supply them with goods, they also refused to answer their questions or,
at best, gave answers which were vague and confusing. *"In contrast to
the Bolsheviks, Makhno partisans received detailed, accurate information
from the population at all times."* [Palij, **Op. Cit.**, pp. 236-7]

Frunze brought in extra forces and ordered both the *"annihilation of
the Makhnovists"* and total disarming of the region. Plagued by
desertions, it was also ordered that all Makhnovist prisoners were to be
shot, to discourage the local population and Red Army soldiers thinking
of joining them. There is also evidence of unrest in the Azov fleet,
with acts of sabotage being carried out by sailors to prevent their
weapons being used against the Makhnovists. [Malet, **Op. Cit.**, p. 73]
While it was common practice for the Bolsheviks to shoot all Makhnovist
prisoners, the *"existence of roundup detachments at the end of 1920,
whose task was to re-collect prisoners freed by the Makhnovists"* shows
that the Makhnovists did not reciprocate in kind. [Malet **Op. Cit.**,
p. 129]

At the end of 1920, the Makhnovists had ten to fifteen thousand troops
and the *"growing strength of the Makhno army and its successes caused
serious concern in the Bolshevik regime, so it was decided to increase
the number of troops opposing Makhno."* [Palij, **Op. Cit.**, p. 237]
All the pressure exerted by the Bolsheviks was paying off. Although
Makhno repeatedly broke through numerous mass encirclements and picked
up deserters from the Red Army, his forces were being eroded by the far
greater numbers employed against them. In addition, *"the Red command
worked out new plans to fight Makhno by stationing whole regiments,
primarily cavalry, in the occupied villages, to terrorise the peasants
and prevent them from supporting Makhno. . . Also the Cheka punitive
units were constantly trailing the partisans, executing Makhno's
sympathisers and the partisans' families."* [Palij, **Op. Cit.**, p.
238] In spite of the difficult conditions, Makhno was still able to
attract some Red Army soldiers and even whole units to his side. For
example, *"when the partisans were fighting Budenny's Fourth Cavalry
Division, their First Brigade, commanded by Maslak, joined Makhno."*
[Palij, **Op. Cit.**, p. 239]

Makhno was forced to leave his home areas of operations and flee east,
then west again. By early January his forces had fought 24 battles in 24
days. This pattern continued throughout March and April into May. In
June, the Bolsheviks changed their strategy to one of predicting where
Makhno was heading and garrisoning troops in that area. In one battle on
15 June, Frunze himself was almost captured. Despite this, the
insurgents were very weak and their peasant base was exhausted by years
of war and civil war. In the most sympathetic areas, Red Army troops
were garrisoned on the peasants. Thus Palij:

> *"[T]hrough combat losses, hardship, and sickness, the number of
> Makhno partisans was diminishing and they were cut off from their main
> sources of recruits and supplies. The Ukrainian peasants were tried of
> the endless terror caused by successive occupation of village after
> village by the Red troops and the Cheka. The continuous fighting and
> requisitions were leaving the peasants with little food and horses for
> the partisans. They could not live in a state of permanent revolution.
> Moreover, there was extreme drought and consequently a bad harvest in
> Ukraine, especially in the region of the Makhno movement."* [**Op.
> Cit.**, pp. 240-1]

The state terrorism and the summer drought caused Makhno to give up the
struggle in mid-August and instead fight his way to the Dniester with
the last of his forces and cross into Romania on August 26. Some of his
forces which stayed behind were still active for a short time. In
November 1921 the Cheka seized 20 machine guns and 2,833 rifles in the
new Zaporizhya province alone.

For more details of the history of the movement, Michael Malet's
**Nestor Makhno in the Russian Revolution** is an excellent summary.
Michael Palij's **The Anarchism of Nestor Makhno** is also worth
consulting, as are the anarchist histories of Voline and Arshinov.

5 How were the Makhnovists organised?
-------------------------------------

Being influenced by anarchist ideas, the Makhnovists were organised
along libertarian lines. This meant that in both civilian and military
areas, self-management was practised. This section discusses the
military organisation, while the next discusses the social aspect of the
movement.

By practising self-management, the Makhnovists offered a completely
different model of military organisation to that of both the Red Army
and traditional military forces. While the army structure changed
depending on its circumstances, the core ideas remained. These were as
follows:

> *"The Makhnovist insurrectionary army was organised according to three
> fundamental principles: voluntary enlistment, the electoral principle,
> and self-discipline.*
>
> "**Voluntary enlistment** meant that the army was composed only of
> revolutionary fighters who entered it of their own free will.
>
> "**The electoral principle** meant that the commanders of all units of
> the army, including the staff, as well as all the men who held other
> positions in the army, were either elected or accepted by the
> insurgents of the unit in question or by the whole army.
>
> "**Self-discipline** meant that all the rules of discipline were drawn
> up by commissions of insurgents, then approved by general assemblies
> of the various units; once approved, they were rigorously observed on
> the individual responsibility of each insurgent and each commander."
> [**Op. Cit.**, p. 96]

Voline paints a similar picture. He also notes that the electoral
principle was sometimes violated and commanders appointed *"in urgent
situations by the commander himself,"* although such people had to be
*"accepted without reservation"* by *"the insurgents of the unit in
question or by the whole army."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 584]

Thus the Makhnovist army, bar some deviation provoked by circumstances,
was a fundamentally democratic organisation. The guerrillas elected the
officers of their detachments, and, at mass assemblies and congresses,
decided policy and discipline for the army. In the words of historian
Michael Palij:

> *"As the Makhno army gradually grew, it assumed a more regular army
> organisation. Each tactical unit was composed of three subordinate
> units: a division consisted of three brigades; a brigade, of three
> regiments; a regiment, of three battalions. Theoretically commanders
> were elected; in practice, however, the top commanders were usually
> carefully selected by Makhno from among his close friends. As a rule,
> they were all equal and if several units fought together the top
> commanders commanded jointly. The army was nominally headed by a
> Revolutionary Military Council of about ten to twenty members . . .
> Like the commanders, the council members were elected, but some were
> appointed by Makhno .. . . There also was an elected cultural section
> in the army. Its aim was to conduct political and ideological
> propaganda among the partisans and peasants."* [Palij, **Op. Cit.**,
> pp. 108-9]

The Revolutionary Military Council was elected and directly accountable
to the regional workers, peasants and insurgent congresses. It was
designed to co-ordinate the local soviets and execute the decisions of
the regional congresses.

Hence Voline:

> *"This council embraced the whole free region. It was supposed to
> carry out all the economic, political, social and military decisions
> made at the congress. It was thus, in a certain sense, the supreme
> executive of the whole movement. **But it was not at all an
> authoritarian organ.** Only strictly executive functions were assigned
> to it. It confined itself to carrying out the instructions and
> decisions of the congress. At any moment, it could be dissolved by the
> congress and cease to exist."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 577]

As such, when Palij notes that this council *"had no decisive voice in
the army's actions,"* he misses the point of the council. [Palij,
**Ibid.**] It did not determine the military affairs of the army, but
rather the interaction of the military and civilians and made sure that
the decisions of congresses were executed. Thus the whole army was
nominally under the control of the regional congresses of workers,
peasants and insurgents. At these congresses, delegates of the toiling
people decided upon the policy to be pursued by the Makhnovist Army. The
Revolutionary Military Soviet existed to oversee that decisions were
implemented, not to determine the military activities of the troops.

It should also be noted that women not only supported the Makhnovists,
they also *"fought alongside the men."* [Arshinov, **Op. Cit.**, p. 145]
However, *"the participation of women in the movement (by all accounts,
quite substantial)"* needs *"further investigation."* [Serge Cipko,
*"Nestor Makhno: A Mini-Historiography of the Anarchist Revolution in
Ukraine, 1917-1921,"* pp. 57-75, **The Raven**, no. 13, p. 75]

At its height, the army was made up of infantry, cavalry, artillery,
machine-gun units, and special branches, including an intelligence
service. As the success of partisan warfare depends upon mobility, the
army gradually mounted its infantry in light carts (called *"tachanka"*)
during 1918-19. As Michael Malet notes, this was a *"novel tactic"* and
Makhno *"could be described as the inventor of the motorised division
before the car came into general use."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 85] The
tachanka was used to transport as many troops as possible, giving the
Makhnovists mobile infantry which could keep up with the cavalry. In
addition, a machine-gun was sometimes mounted in the rear (in autumn
1919, the 1st machine-gun regiment consisted of 120 guns, all mounted on
tachanki).

For the most part the Makhnovist army was a volunteer army, unlike all
others operating in the Russian Civil War. However, at times of crisis
attempts were made to mobilise troops. For example, the Second regional
congress agreed that a *"general voluntary and equalitarian
mobilisation"* should take place. This meant that this appeal,
*"sanctioned by the moral authority of the congress, emphasised the need
for fresh troops in the insurrectionary army, no-one was compelled to
enlist."* [Voline, **Op. Cit.**, p. 577] The Congress itself passed a
resolution after a long and passionate debate that stated it *"rejected
'compulsory' mobilisation, opting for an 'obligatory' one; that is, each
peasant who is able to carry arms, should recognise his obligation to
enlist in the ranks of the partisans and to defend the interests of the
entire toiling people of Ukraine."* [quoted by Palij, **Op. Cit.**, p.
155] There were far more volunteers than arms, the opposite of what
occurred to both the Reds and Whites during the Civil War. [Malet, **Op.
Cit.**, p. 106]

The third Congress decided to conduct a voluntary mobilisation all those
born between 1889 and 1898. This congress told them to assemble at
certain points, organise themselves and elect their officers. Another
mobilisation decided at the Aleksandrovsk congress never took place. How
far the Makhnovists were forced to conscript troops is still a matter of
debate. Paul Avrich, for example, states that *"voluntary mobilisation"*
in reality *"meant outright conscription, as all able-bodied men were
required to serve."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 114] On the other side, surviving
leaflets from 1920 *"are in the nature of appeals to join up, not
instructions."* [Malet,**Op. Cit.**, p. 105] Trotsky, ironically, noted
that *"Makhno does not have general mobilisations, and indeed these
would be impossible, as he lacks the necessary apparatus."* [quoted by
Malet, **Op. Cit.**, p. 106] It is probably right to say that the
Congresses desired that every able-bodied man join the Makhnovist army,
but they simply did not have the means to enforce that desire and that
the Makhnovists tried their best to avoid conscription by appealing to
the peasants' revolutionary conscience, with some success.

As well as the military organisation, there was also an explicitly
anarchist federation operating in the Ukraine at the same time. The
first conference to organise a *"Confederation of Anarchist
Organisations of the Ukraine"* was held between November 12th to 16th,
1918. The new federation was named *"Nabat"* (Alarm) and had a
six-person Secretariat. Kharkiv was chosen as its headquarters, while it
had groups in other major Ukrainian cities (including Kyiv, Odessa and
Katerynoslav). The final organisation of the Nabat was accomplished at a
conference held in April 2-7, 1919. The federation aimed to form a
*"united anarchism"* and guaranteed a substantial degree of autonomy for
every participating group and individual. A number of newspapers
appeared in a Ukrainian towns and cities (mostly entitled **Nabat**), as
did leaflets and pamphlets. There was a main weekly paper (called
**Nabat**) which was concerned largely with anarchist theory. This
completed the Makhnovist papers **Road to Freedom** (which was often
daily, sometimes weekly and dealt with libertarian ideas, everyday
problems and information on partisan activities) and **The Makhnovist
Voice** (which dealt primarily with the interests, problems, and tasks
of the Makhnovist movement and its army). The Nabat organisation was
also published a pamphlet dealing with the Makhnovist movement's
problems, the economic organisation of the region, the free soviets, the
social basis of the society that was to be built, and the problem of
defence.

Unsurprisingly, the Nabat federation and the Makhnovists worked together
closely, with Nabat members worked in the army (particularly its
cultural section). Some of its members were also elected to the
Makhnovist Revolutionary Military Soviet. It should be noted that the
Nabat federation gained a number of experienced anarchists from Soviet
Russia, who fled to the Ukraine to escape Bolshevik repression. The
Nabat shared the fortunes of the Makhno movement. It carried on its work
freely as long as the region was controlled by the Makhnovist Army, but
when Bolshevik or White forces prevailed, the anarchists were forced
underground. The movement was finally crushed in November 1920, when the
Bolsheviks betrayed the Makhnovists.

As can be seen, the Makhnovists implemented to a large degree the
anarchist idea of self-managed, horizontally federated associations
(when possible, of course). Both the two major organisational layers to
the Makhnovist structure (the army and the congresses) were federated
horizontally and the "top" structure was essentially a mass peasant,
worker and guerrilla decision-making coalition. In other words, the
masses took decisions at the "top" level that the Revolutionary Military
Soviet and the Makhnovist army were bound to follow. The army was
answerable to the local Soviets and to the congresses of soviets and, as
we discuss in [section 7](append46.html#app7), the Makhnovists called
working-people and insurgent congresses whenever they could.

The Makhnovist movement was, fundamentally, a working class movement. It
was *"one of the very few revolutionary movements to be led and
controlled throughout by members of 'the toiling masses.'"* [David
Footman, **Op. Cit.**, p. 245] It applied its principles of working
class autonomy and self-organisation as far as it could. Unlike the Red
Army, it was predominantly organised from the bottom up, rejecting the
use of Tsarist officers, appointed commanders, and other "top-down" ways
of the Red Army (see [section 14](append46.html#app14) for further
discussion of the differences between the two forces).

The Makhnovist army was not by any means a perfect model of anarchist
military organisation. However, compared to the Red Army, its violations
of principle are small and hardly detract from their accomplishment of
applying anarchist ideas in often extremely difficult circumstances.

6 Did the Makhnovists have a constructive social programme?
-----------------------------------------------------------

Yes, they did. The Makhnovists spent a great deal of energy and effort
in developing, propagating and explaining their ideas on how a free
society should be created and run. As Michael Malet noted, the *"leading
Makhnovists had definite ideas about the ideal form of social
organisation."* [**Nestor Makhno in the Russian Civil War**, p. 107]
Moreover, as we discuss in the [next section](append46.html#app7), they
also successfully applied these ideas when and where they could.

So what was their social programme? Being anarchists, it comprised two
parts, namely political and economic aspects. The Makhnovists aimed for
a true social revolution in which the working classes (both urban and
rural) could actively manage their own affairs and society. As such,
their social programme reflected the fact that oppression has its roots
in both political and economic power and so aimed at eliminating both
the state and private property. As the core of their social ideas was
the simple principle of working-class autonomy, the idea that the
liberation of working-class people must be the task of the working-class
people themselves. This vision is at the heart of anarchism and was
expressed most elegantly by Makhno:

> *"Conquer or die -- such is the dilemma that faces the Ukrainian
> peasants and workers at this historic moment . . . But we will not
> conquer in order to repeat the errors of the past years, the error of
> putting our fate into the hands of new masters; we will conquer in
> order to take our destinies into our own hands, to conduct our lives
> according to our own will and our own conception of the truth."*
> [quoted by Peter Arshinov, **The History of the Makhnovist Movement**,
> p. 58]

As such, the Makhnovists were extremely hostile to the idea of state
power, recognising it simply as a means by which the majority are ruled
by the few. Equally, they were opposed to wage slavery (to private or
state bosses), recognising that as long as the workers do not manage
their own work, they can never be free. As they put it, their goals
could only be achieved by an *"implacable revolution and consistent
struggle against all lies, arbitrariness and coercion, wherever they
come from, a struggle to the death, a struggle for free speech, for the
righteous cause, a struggle with weapons in hand. Only through the
abolition of all rulers, through the destruction of the whole foundation
of their lies, in state affairs as well as in political and economic
affairs. And only through the social revolution can the genuine
Worker-Peasant soviet system be realised and can we arrive at
SOCIALISM."* [contained in Arshinov, **Op. Cit.**, p. 273] They, like
other anarchists and the Kronstadt rebels, termed this programme of
working class self-management the ***"third revolution."***

We will discuss the political aspect of the Makhnovist programme first,
then its economic one. However, the Maknovists considered (correctly)
that both aspects could not be separated. As they put it: *"We will not
lay down our arms until we have wiped out once and for all every
political and economic oppression and until genuine equality and
brotherhood is established in the land."* [contained in Arshinov, **Op.
Cit.**, p. 281] We split the aspects simply to aid the presentation of
their ideas.

At the core of their ideas was what they termed the ***"Free Soviet
System"*** (or ***"free soviets"*** for short). It was this system which
would allow the working class to create and run a new society. As they
put it:

> *"[The] Makhnovists realise that the working people are no longer a
> flock of sheep to be ordered about by anyone. We consider the working
> people capable of building, on their own and without parties,
> commissars or generals, their own FREE SOVIET SYSTEM, in which those
> who are elected to the Soviet will not, as now [under the Bolsheviks],
> command and order us, but on the contrary, will be only the executors
> of the decisions made in our own workers' gatherings and
> conferences."* [contained in Peter Arshinov, **Op. Cit.**, pp. 280-1]

Thus the key idea advocated by the leading Makhnovista for social
organisation and decision-making was the *"free toilers' soviet of
peasant and worker organisations."* This meant they were to be
independent of all central authority and composed of those who worked,
and not political parties. They were to federate on a local, then
regional and then national level, and power within the federation was to
be horizontal and not vertical. [Michael Malet, **Op. Cit.**, p. 107]
Such a system was in opposition to the Bolshevik practice of Soviets
defined and dominated by political parties with a vertical decision-
making structure that reached its highest point in the Bolshevik Central
Committee.

Thus, for the Makhnovists, the soviet system would be a "bottom-up"
system, one designed not to empower a few party leaders at the centre
but rather a means by which working people could manage their own
affairs. As the put it, the *"soviet system is not the power of the
social-democratic Communist-Bolsheviks who now call themselves a soviet
power; rather it is the supreme form of non-authoritarian anti-state
socialism, which expresses itself in the organisation of a free, happy
and independent system of social life for the working people."* This
would be based on the *"principles of solidarity, friendship and
equality."* This meant that in the Makhnovist system of free soviets,
the *"working people themselves must freely choose their own soviets,
which will carry out the will and desires of the working people
themselvs, that is to say, ADMINISTRATIVE, not ruling soviets."*
[contained in Arshinov, **Op. Cit.**, pp. 272-3]

As David Footman summarises, Makhno's *"ultimate aims were simple. All
instruments of government were to be destroyed. All political parties
were to be opposed, as all of them were working for some or other form
of new government in which the party members would assume the role of a
ruling class. All social and economic affairs were to be settled in
friendly discussion between freely elected representatives of the
toiling masses."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 247]

Hence the Makhnovist social organisation was a federation of
self-managed workers' and peasants' councils (soviets), which would *"be
only the executors of the decisions made in our workers' gatherings and
conferences."* [contained in Arshinov, **Op. Cit.**, p. 281] In other
words, an anarchist system based on mass assemblies and decision-making
from the bottom up.

Economically, as is to be expected, the Makhnovists opposed private
property, capitalism and wage-slavery. Their economic ideas were
summarised in a Makhnovist declaration as follows:

> *"The lands of the service gentry, of the monasteries, of the princes
> and other enemies of the toiling masses, with all their livestock and
> goods, are passed on to the use of those peasants who support
> themselves solely through their own labour. This transfer will be
> carried out in an orderly fashion determined in common at peasant
> assemblies, which must remember in this matter not only each of their
> own personal interests, but also bear in mind the common interest of
> all the oppressed, working peasantry.*
> "Factories, workshops, mines and other tools and means of production
> become the property of the working class as a whole, which will run
> all enterprises themselves, through their trade unions, getting
> production under way and striving to tie together all industry in the
> country in a single, unitary organisation." [contained in Arshinov,
> **Op. Cit.**, p. 266]

They continually stressed that the *"land, the factories, the workshops,
the mines, the railroads and the other wealth of the people must belong
to the working people themselves, to those who work in them, that is to
say, they must be socialised."* This meant a system of use-rights, as
*"the land, the mines, the factories, the workshops, the railroads, and
so on, will belong neither to individuals nor to the government, but
solely to those who work with them."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 273 and p. 281]

In industry, such a system clearly implied a system of worker's
self-management within a system of federated factory committees or union
branches. On the land, it meant the end of landlordism, with peasants
being entitled to as much land and equipment as they could cultivate
without the use of hired labour. As a Makhnovist congress in 1919
resolved:

> *"The land question should be decided on a Ukraine-wide scale at an
> all-Ukrainian congress of peasants on the following basis: in the
> interests of socialism and the struggle against the bourgeoisie, all
> land should be transferred to the hands of the toiling peasants.
> According to the principle that 'the land belongs to nobody' and can
> be used only by those who care about it, who cultivate it, the land
> should be transferred to the toiling peasantry of Ukraine for their
> use without pay according to the norm of equal distribution."* [quoted
> by Palij, **Op. Cit.**, p. 155]

In addition to advocating the abolition of private property in land and
the end of wage labour by distributing land to those who worked it, the
Makhnovists also supported the forming of *"free"* or *"working"*
communes. Like their policy of land distribution, it also aimed to
benefit the poorer peasants and rural wage labourers. The *"free
commune"* was a voluntary association of rural workers who took over an
expropriated estate and managed the land in common. The commune was
managed by a general meeting of all its members and based on the
liberty, equality and solidarity of its members.

Clearly, in terms of their economic policies, the Makhnovists proposed a
clear and viable alternative to both rural and urban capitalism, namely
workers' self-management. Industry and land would be socialised, with
the actual management of production resting in the hands of the workers
themselves and co-ordinated by federated workers' organisations. On the
land, they proposed the creation of voluntary communes which would
enable the benefits of co-operative labour to be applied. Like their
political ideas, their economic ideas were designed to ensure the
freedom of working people and the end of hierarchy in all aspects of
society.

In summary, the Makhnovist had a constructive social ideas which aimed
to ensure the total economic and political emancipation of the working
people. Their vision of a free society was based on a federation of
free, self-managed soviets, the socialisation of the means of life and
workers' self-management of production by a federation of labour unions
or factory committees. As the black flags they carried into battle read,
*"liberty or death"* and *"the land to the peasants, the factories to
the workers."*

7 Did they apply their ideas in practice?
-----------------------------------------

Yes, the Makhnovists consistently applied their political and social
ideas when they had the opportunity to do so. Unlike the Bolsheviks, who
quickly turned away from their stated aims of soviet democracy and
workers' control in favour of dictatorship by the Bolshevik party, the
Makhnovists did all in their power to encourage, create and defend
working-class freedom and self-management (see [section
14](append46.html#app14) for further discussion). In the words of
historian Christopher Reed:

> *"there can be no question that the anarchists did everything they
> could to free the peasants and workers and give them the opportunity
> to develop their own forms of collective control over land and
> factories . . . [T]he Ukrainian anarchists fought under the slogan of
> land to the peasants, factories to the workers and power to the
> soviets. Wherever they had influence they supported the setting up of
> communes and soviets. They introduced safeguards intended to protect
> direct self-government from organised interference . . . They
> conducted relentless class war against landlords, officers, factory
> owners and the commercial classes could expect short shrift from
> Makhno and his men, especially if they had taken up arms against the
> people or, like the Whites . . ., had been responsible for looting,
> pogroms and vicious reprisals against unarmed peasants on a colossal
> scale."* [**From Tsar to Soviets**, p. 263]

As we discussed in the [last section](append46.html#app6), the core
ideas which inspired the Makhnovists were working-class
self-determination and self-management. They aimed at the creation of a
*"free soviet system"* and the end of capitalism by rural and industrial
self-management. It is to the credit of the Makhnovists that they
applied these ideas in practice rather than talking about high
principles and doing the exact opposite.

In practice, of course, the war left little room for much construction
work. As Voline pointed out, one of the key disadvantages of the
movement was the *"almost continual necessity of fighting and defending
itself against all kinds of enemies, without being able to concentrate
on peaceful and truly positive works."* [**The Unknown Revolution**, p.
571] However, in the disruption of the Civil War the Makhnovists applied
their ideas when and where they could.

Within the army, as we discussed in [section 5](append46.html#app5), the
insurgent troops elected their own commanders and had regular mass
assemblies to discuss policy and the agreed norms of conduct within it.
In civilian matters, the Makhnovists **from the start** encouraged
working-class self-organisation and self-government. By late 1917, in
the area around Hulyai Pole *"the toiling masses proceeded . . . to
consolidate their revolution. The little factories functioned . . .
under the control of the workers. The estates were split up . . . among
the peasants . . . a certain number of agricultural communes were
formed."* [David Footman, **Op. Cit.**, p. 248]

The aim of the Makhnovists was to *"transfer all the lands owned by the
gentry, monasteries, and the state into the hands of peasants or to
organise, if they wished, peasant communes."* [Palij, **Op. Cit.**, p.
70] This policy was introduced from the start, and by the autumn of
1917, all land, equipment and livestock around Hulyai Pole had been
expropriated from the gentry and kulaks and placed in the hands of
working peasants. Land reform had been achieved by the direct action of
the peasantry.

However, *"many of the peasants understood that the task was not
finished, that it was not enough to appropriate a plot of land and be
content with it. From the hardships of their lives they learned that
enemies were watching from all sides, and that they must stick together.
In several places there were attempts to organise social life
communally."* [Arshinov, **Op. Cit.**, p. 86]

In line with social anarchist theory, the Makhnovists also tried to
introduce collective forms of farming. These experiments in collective
working and living were called *"free communes."* Despite the difficult
military situation communes were established, principally near Hulyai
Pole, in the autumn of 1917. This activity was resumed in February to
March of 1918. They re-appeared in early 1919, once the threat of
counter-revolution had been (temporarily) defeated.

There were four of these communes within five miles of Hulyai Pole
itself and many more further afield. According to Makhno, these
agricultural communes *"were in most cases organised by peasants, though
sometimes their composition was a mixture of peasants and workmen
[sic!]. Their organisation was based on equality and solidarity of the
members. All members of these communes -- both men and women -- applied
themselves willingly to their tasks, whether in the field or the
household."* Unlike many communes, people were given the personal space
they desired, so *"any members of the commune who wanted to cook
separately for themselves and their children, or to take food from the
communal kitchens and eat it in their own quarters, met with no
objection from the other members."* The management of each commune *"was
conducted by a general meeting of all its members."* In addition, the
communes decided to introducing anarchist schooling based on the ideas
of Franciso Ferrer (see [section J.5.13](secJ5.html#secj513) for
details). Makhno himself worked on one for two days a week for a period.
[Makhno, quoted by Paul Avrich, **Anarchists in the Russian
Revolution**, pp. 131]

They were set up on the former estates of landlords, and consisted of
around 10 families or 100 to 300 people and although each had peasant
anarchist members not all the members were anarchists. Makhno worked on
Commune No. 1, which was on the estate of former landlord Klassen. When
re-founded in 1919 this commune was named after Rosa Luxemburg, the
Marxist revolutionary who had recently been murdered in the German
revolution. It was a success, for by the spring sowing it had grown from
nine families to 285 members working 340 acres of land. The communes
represented a way that poor and middle peasants could pool resources to
work estates that they could not have worked otherwise and, as Michael
Malet points out, *"they were organised from the bottom up, not the top
down."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 121]

However, as Makhno himself acknowledged, while the *"majority of the
toiling population saw in the organisation of rural communes the healthy
germ of a new social life"* which could provide a *"model of a free and
communal form of life,"* the *"mass of people did not go over to it."*
They cited as their reasons *"the advance of the German and Austrian
armies, their own lack of organisation, and their inability to defend
this order against the new 'revolutionary' [Bolshevik] and
counter-revolutionary authorities. For this reason the toiling
population of the district limited their revolutionary activity to
supporting in every way those bold springs."* [Makhno, quoted by Avrich,
**Op. Cit.**, p. 132] Given that the communes were finally destroyed by
White and Red forces in June 1919, their caution was justified. After
this, peace did not return long enough for the experiment to be
restarted.

As Michael Malet argues:

> *"Very few peasant movements in history have been able to show in
> practice the sort of society and type of landholding they would like
> to see. The Makhnovist movement is proof that peasant revolutionaries
> can put forward positive, practical ideas."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 121]

The Makhnovist experiments, it should be noted, have strong similarities
to the rural revolution during the Spanish Revolution of 1936 (see
sections [I.8.5](secI8.html#seci85) and [I.8.6](secI8.html#seci86) for
more details).

As well as implementing their economic ideas on workers'
self-management, land reform and free communes, the Makhnovists also
organised regional congresses as well as local soviets. Most of the
activity happened in and around Hulyai Pole, the focal point of the
movement.This was in accord with their vision of a *"free soviet
system."* Needless to say, the congresses could only be called during
periods of relative calm (i.e. the Makhnovist home area was not occupied
by hostile forces) and so congresses of insurgents, peasants and workers
were called in early 1919 and another in October of that year. The
actual dates of the regional congresses were:

> 23 January 1919 at Velyka Mykhailivka
>
> 12 February 1919 at Hulyai Pole
>
> 10 April 1919 at Hulyai Pole
>
> 20 October 1919 at Aleksandrovsk

A congress for the fifteenth of June 1919 never met because Trotsky
unilaterally banned it, under pain of death to anyone even
**discussing** it, never mind calling for it or attending as a delegate.
Unlike the third congress, which ignored a similar ban by Dybenko, the
fourth congress could not go ahead due to the treacherous attack by the
Red Army that preceded it. Four Makhnovist commanders were executed by
the Red Army for advertising this congress. Another congress planned for
Aleksandrovsk in November 1920 was also prevented by Bolshevik betrayal,
namely the attack after Wrangel had been defeated. [Malet, **Op. Cit.**,
p. 108] See [section 13](append46.html#app13) for further details.

The reason for these regional congresses was simple, to co-ordinate the
revolution. *"It was indispensable,"* Arshinov notes, *"to establish
institutions which unified first a district composed of various
villages, and then the districts and departments which composed the
liberated region. It was indispensable to find general solutions for
problems common to the entire region. It was indispensable to create
organs suitable for these tasks. And the peasants did not fail to create
them. These organs were the regional congresses of peasants and
workers."* [**Op. Cit.**, pp. 87-8] These congresses *"were composed of
delegates of peasants, workers and of the insurgent army, and were
intended to clarify and record the decisions of the toiling masses and
to be regarded as the supreme authority for the liberated area."* [David
Footman, **Op. Cit.**, p. 266]

The first congress, which was the smallest, discussed the strengthening
of the front, the adoption of a common nomenclature for popular
organisations (soviets and the like) and to send a delegation to
convince the draftees in the Nationalist forces to return home. It was
also decided to organise a second congress. The second congress was
larger, having 245 delegates from 350 districts. This congress *"was
strongly anti-Bolshevik and favoured a democratic socio-political way of
life."* [Palij, **Op. Cit.**, p. 153] One delegate made the issue clear:

> *"No party has a right to usurp governmental power into its own hands
> . . . We want life, all problems, to be decided locally, not by order
> from any authority above; and all peasants and workers should decide
> their own fate, while those elected should only carry out the toilers'
> wish."* [quoted by Palij, **Op. Cit.**, p. 154]

A general resolution was passed, which acknowledged the fact that the
Bolshevik party was *"demanding a monopoly of the Revolution."* It also
stated:

> *"With deep regret the Congress must also declare that apart from
> external enemies a perhaps even greater danger, arising from its
> internal shortcomings, threatens the Revolution of the Russian and
> Ukrainian peasants and workers. The Soviet Governments of Russia and
> of the Ukraine, by their orders and decrees, are making efforts to
> deprive local soviets of peasants and workers' deputies of their
> freedom and autonomy."* [quoted by Footman, **Op. Cit.**, p. 267]

As noted in [section 5](append46.html#app5), the congress also decided
to issue an *"obligatory"* mobilisation to gather troops for the Army.
It also accepted a resolution on land reform, stating that the land
*"belongs to nobody"* and could be used by anyone as long as they did
not use wage labour (see [section 6](append46.html#app6) for the full
resolution). The congress accepted a resolution against plunder,
violence, and anti-Jewish pogroms, recognising it as an attempt by the
Tsarist government to *"turn the attention of all toiling people away
from the real reason for their poverty,"* namely the Tsarist regime's
oppression. [quoted by Palij, **Op. Cit.**, p. 155]

The second congress also elected the Revolutionary Military Soviet of
Peasants, Workers and Insurgents, which had *"no powers to initiate
policy but designed merely to implement the decisions of the periodic
congresses."* [Footman, **Op. Cit.**, p. 267]

The third congress was the largest and most representative, with
delegates from 72 volosts (in which two million people lived). This
congress aimed to *"clarify the situation and to consider the prospects
for the future of the region."* It decided to conduct a voluntary
mobilisation of men to fight the Whites and *"rejected, with the
approval of both rich and poor peasants, the Bolshevik expropriations."*
[Palij, **Op. Cit.**, p. 158] Toward the end of the congress, it
received a telegram from the Bolshevik commander Dybenko calling it
*"counter-revolutionary,"* its organisers *"outlaws"* and dissolving it
by his order. The congress immediately voted an indignant resolution in
rely. This corrected Dybenko's factual mistakes on who called it,
informed him why it was called, gave him a history lesson on the
Makhnovist region and asked him:

> *"Can there exist laws made by a few people who call themselves
> revolutionaries which permit them to outlaw a whole people who are
> more revolutionary than they are themselves? . . .*
>
> "Is it permissible, is it admissible, that they should come to the
> country to establish laws of violence, to subjugate a people who have
> just overthrown all lawmakers and all laws?
>
> "Does there exist a law according to which a revolutionary has the
> right to apply the most severe penalties to a revolutionary mass, of
> which he calls himself the defender, simply because this mass has
> taken the good things which the revolution promised them, freedom and
> equality, without his permission?
>
> "Should the mass of revolutionary people perhaps be silent when such a
> revolutionary takes away the freedom which they have just conquered?
>
> "Do the laws of the revolution order the shooting of a delegate
> because he believes he ought to carry out the mandate given him by the
> revolutionary mass which elected him?
>
> "Whose interests should the revolutionary defend; those of the Party
> or those of the people who set the revolution in motion with their
> blood?" [quoted by Arshinov, **Op. Cit.**, p. 103]

As we discuss in [section 13](append46.html#app13), Trotsky's order to
ban the fourth congress indicates that such laws do exist, with the
*"entire peasant and labouring population are declared guilty of high
treason if they dare participate in their own free congress."*
[Arshinov, **Op. Cit.**, p. 123]

The last congress was held between 20th and 26th of October in
Aleksandrovsk. One delegate was to be elected per 3000 people and one
delegate per military unit. This gave 270 mostly peasant delegates. Only
18 were workers, of which 6 were Mensheviks, who walked out after Makhno
called them *"lapdogs of the bourgeoisie"* during the discussion on
*"free socio-economic organisations"*! [Malet, **Op. Cit.**, p. 109] The
congress passed a number of resolutions, concentrating on the care of
the wounded and the poorest part of the population, a voluntary
mobilisation, voluntary peasant contributions to feed the army and
forced levies on the bourgeoisie.

According to Voline, the chairman, Makhnovist ideas were freely
discussed:

> *"The idea of free Soviets, genuinely functioning in the interests of
> the working population; the question of direct relationships between
> peasants and city workers, based on mutual exchange of the products of
> their labour; the launching of a libertarian and egalitarian social
> organisation in the cities and the country; all these question were
> seriously and closely studied by the delegates themselves, with the
> assistance and co-operation of qualified comrades."* [**Op. Cit.**, p.
> 640]

He notes that the congress *"decided that the workers, without any
authority, would organise their economic, political and administrative
life for themselves, by means of their own abilities, and through their
own direct organs, united on a federative basis."* [**Op. Cit.**, p.
641]

It is significant to note that the congress also discussed the
activities of the Makhnovists within the city itself. One delegate
raised the issue of the activities of the Kontrrazvedka, the Makhnovist
*"counter-intelligence"* section. As noted in [section
5](append46.html#app5), the Makhnovists, like all the armies in the
Russian Civil War, had its intelligence service. It combined a number of
functions, such as military reconnaissance, arrest and holding of
prisoners, counter-insurgency (*"Originally it had a punitive function,
but because of improper treatment of prisoners of war, it was deprived
of its punitive function."* [Palij, **Op. Cit.**, p. 300]). The delegate
stated that this *"counter-espionage service"* was engaged in
*"arbitrary acts and uncontrolled actions -- of which some are very
serious, rather like the Bolshevik Cheka."* [quoted by Voline, **Op.
Cit.**, p. 643] Immediately a commission of several delegates was
created to investigate the situation. Voline argues that *"[s]uch an
initiative on the part of workers' delegates would not have been
possible under the Bolshevik regime. It was by activity of this kind
that the congress gave a preview of the way in which a society should
function from the beginning if it is based on a desire for progress and
self-realisation."* [Voline, **Ibid.**] Sadly, the commission could not
complete its work due to the city being evacuated soon after the
congress.

Another incident shows that under the Makhnovists the civilian
population was in control. A delegate noted that Klein, the Makhnovist
military commander in the city, had become publicly and riotously drunk
after issuing proclamations against drunkenness. Klein was called before
the congress, which accepted his apology and his request to be sent to
the front, away from the boredom of desk work which had driven him to
drink! This, according to Voline, showed that the workers and their
congress were the masters and the army its servant. [Voline, **Op.
Cit.**, pp. 645-7]

Outside of the congresses the work of local Soviets was to be
co-ordinated through the Revolutionary Military Soviet (RMS), the first
RMS was set up by the 2nd congress and consisted of one delegate for
each of the 32 volsts the Makhnovista had liberated. The RMS was to be
answerable to the congresses and limited to implementing their decisions
but the difficult military situation meant this seldom happened. When it
did (the 3rd Congress) the Congress had no problems with its actions in
the previous period. After the Aleksandrovsk congress, the RMS consisted
of 22 delegates including three known Bolsheviks and four known
Makhnovists, the Bolsheviks considered the remaining delegates
*"anarchists or anarchist sympathisers".*

The military chaos of 1920 saw the RMS dissolved and replaced by the
Soviet of Revolutionary Insurgents of the Ukraine, which consisted of
seven members elected by the insurgent army. Its secretary was a left
Socialist Revolutionary. The RMS in addition to making decisions between
Congresses carried out propaganda work including the editing of the
Makhnovist paper *"The Road to Freedom"* and collected and distributed
money.

Lastly, we must discuss what happened when the Makhnovists applied their
ideas in any cities they liberated as this gives a clear idea of the way
they applied their ideas in practice. Anarchist participant Yossif the
Emigrant stated that it was *"Makhno's custom upon taking a city or town
to call the people together and announce to them that henceforth they
are free to organise their lives as they think best for themselves. He
always proclaims complete freedom of speech and press; he does not fill
the prisons or begin executions, as the Communists do."* He stressed it
was *"the expression of the toilers themselves"* and *"the first great
mass movement that by its own efforts seeks to free itself from
government and establish economic self-determination. In that sense it
is thoroughly Anarchistic."* [Alexander Berkman, **The Bolshevik Myth**,
pp. 193-5]

Arshinov paints a similar picture:

> *"As soon as they entered a city, they declared that they did not
> represent any kind of authority, that their armed forces obliged no
> one to any sort of obligation and had no other aim than to protect the
> freedom of the working people. The freedom of the peasants and the
> workers, said the Makhnovists, resides in the peasants and workers
> themselves and may not be restricted. In all fields of their lives it
> is up to the workers and peasants themselves to construct whatever
> they consider necessary. As for the Makhnovists -- they can only
> assist them with advice, by putting at their disposal the intellectual
> or military forces they need, but under no circumstances can the
> Makhnovists prescribe for them in any manner."* [Arshinov, **Op.
> Cit.**, p. 148]

In addition, the Makhnovists *"fully applied the revolutionary
principles of freedom of speech, of thought, of the press, and of
political association. In all cities and towns occupied by the
Makhnovists, they began by lifting all the prohibitions and repealing
all the restrictions imposed on the press and on political organisations
by one or another power."* Indeed, the *"only restriction that the
Makhnovists considered necessary to impose on the Bolsheviks, the left
Socialist-Revolutionaries and other statists was a prohibition on the
formation of those 'revolutionary committees' which sought to impose a
dictatorship over the people."* They also took the opportunity to
destroy every prison they got their hands on, believing that free people
*"have no use for prisons"* which are *"always built only to subjugate
the people, the workers and peasants."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 153, p. 154
and p. 153]

The Makhnovists encouraged self-management. Looking at Aleksandrovsk:

> *"They immediately invited the working population to participate in a
> general conference of the workers of the city. When the conference
> met, a detailed report was given on the military situation in the
> region and it was proposed that the workers organise the life of the
> city and the functioning of the factories with their own forces and
> their own organisations, basing themselves on the principles of labour
> and equality. The workers enthusiastically acclaimed all these
> suggestions; but they hesitated to carry them out, troubled by their
> novelty, and troubled mainly by the nearness of the front, which made
> them fear that the situation of the town was uncertain and unstable.
> The first conference was followed by a second. The problems of
> organising life according to principles of self-management by workers
> were examined and discussed with animation by the masses of workers,
> who all welcomed these ideas with the greatest enthusiasm, but who
> only with difficulty succeeded in giving them concrete forms. Railroad
> workers took the first step in this direction. They formed a committee
> charged with organising the railway network of the region . . . From
> this point, the proletariat of Aleksandrovsk began to turn
> systematically to the problem of creating organs of self-management."*
> [**Op. Cit.**, p. 149]

Unfortunately, the Makhnovists occupied only two cities (Alexandrovsk
for four weeks and Katerinoslav for two periods of one and five weeks
respectively). As a rule the Makhnovist rank and file had little or no
experience of life in the cities and this placed severe limits on their
ability to understand the specific problems of the workers there. In
addition, the cities did not have a large anarchist movement, meaning
that the Mensheviks and Bolsheviks had more support then they did. Both
parties were, at best, neutral to the Makhnovists and anarchists, so
making it likely that they would influence the city workers against the
movement. As Voline noted, the *"absence of a vigorous organised
workers' movement which could support the peasant insurgents"* was a
disadvantage. [**Op. Cit.**, p. 571]

There were minor successes in both cities. In Alexandrovsk, some trains
were got running and a few factories reopened. In Katerinoslav (where
the city was under a state of siege and constant bombardment by the
Whites), the tobacco workers won a collective agreement that had long
been refused and the bakers set themselves to preparing the
socialisation of their industry and drawing up plans to feed both the
army and the civilian population. Unsurprisingly, the bakers had long
been under anarcho-syndicalist influence. [Malet, **Op. Cit.**, p. 124]

Clearly, whenever they could, the Makhnovists practised their stated
goals of working-class self-management and supported the organisational
structures to ensure the control of and participation in the social
revolution by the toiling masses. Equally, when they liberated towns and
cities they did not impose their own power upon the working-class
population but rather urged it to organise itself by setting up soviets,
unions and other forms of working-class power. They urged workers to
organise self-management of industry. True to the anarchist vision of a
free society, they advocated and practised freedom of assembly, speech
and organisation. In the words of historian Christopher Reed:

> *"Makhno's Insurgent Army . . . was the quintessence of a
> self-administered, people's revolutionary army. It arose from the
> peasants, it was composed of peasants, it handed power to the
> peasants. It encouraged the growth of communes, co-operatives and
> soviets but distrusted all permanent elites attempting to take hold
> within them. It would be foolish to think that Makhno was supported by
> every peasant or that he and his followers could not, on occasions,
> direct their cruelty towards dissidents within their own ranks, but,
> on the whole, the movement perhaps erred on the side of being too
> self-effacing, of handing too much authority to the population at key
> moments."* [**From Tsar to Soviets**, p. 260]

As such, Makhnovist practice matched its theory. This can be said of few
social movements and it is to their credit that this is the case.

8 Weren't the Makhnovists just Kulaks?
--------------------------------------

According to Trotsky (and, of course, repeated by his followers),
*"Makhno created a cavalry of peasants who supplied their own horses.
These were not the downtrodden village poor whom the October revolution
first awakened, but the strong and well-fed peasants who were afraid of
losing what they had. The anarchist ideas of Makhno (ignoring of the
state, non-recognition of the central power) corresponded to the spirit
of this kulak cavalry as nothing else could."* He argued that the
Makhnovist struggle was not the anarchist struggle against the state and
capitalism, but rather *"a struggle of the infuriated petty property
owner against the proletarian dictatorship."* The Makhno movement, he
stressed, was just an example of the *"convulsions of the peasant petty
bourgeoisie which desired, of course, to liberate itself from capital
but at the same time did not consent to subordinate itself to the
dictatorship of the proletariat."* [Lenin and Trotsky, **Kronstadt**, p.
80, p. 89 and pp. 89-90]

Unfortunately for those who use this kind of argument against the
Makhnovists, it fails to stand up to any kind of scrutiny. Ignoring the
sophistry of equating the Bolshevik party's dictatorship with the
"dictatorship of the proletariat," we can easily refute Trotsky's
somewhat spurious argument concerning the background of the Makhnovists.

Firstly, however, we should clarify what is meant by the term *"kulak."*
According to one set of Trotskyist editors, it was *"popularly used to
refer to well-to-do peasants who owned land and hired poor peasants to
work it."* [*"glossary,"* Lenin and Trotsky, **Kronstadt**, p. 146] The
term itself derives from the Russian for *"fist,"* with appropriate
overtones of grasping and meanness. In other words, a rural small-scale
capitalist (employer of wage labour and often the renter of land and
loaner of money as well) rather than a well-off peasant as such.
Trotsky, however, muddies the water considerably by talking about the
*"peasant petty bourgeoisie"* as well. Given that a peasant **is**
*"petty"* (i.e. petit) bourgeois (i.e. own and use their own means of
production), Trotsky is blurring the lines between rural capitalist
(kulak) and the middle peasantry, as occurred so often under Bolshevik
rule.

Secondly, we could just point to the eyewitness accounts of the
anarchists Arshinov and Voline. Both stress that the Makhno movement was
a mass revolutionary movement of the peasant and working poor in the
Southern Ukraine. Arshinov states that after Denikin's troops had been
broken in 1919, the Makhnovists *"literally swept through villages,
towns and cities like an enormous broom"* and the *"returned
**pomeshchiks** [landlords], the **kulaks** , the police, the priests"*
were destroyed, so refuting the *"the myth spread by the Bolsheviks
about the so-called **kulak** character of the Makhnovshchina."*
Ironically, he states that *"wherever the Makhnovist movement developed,
the **kulaks** sought the protection of the Soviet authorities, and
found it there."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 145] Yossif the Emigrant, another
anarchist active in the movement, told anarchist Alexander Berkman that
while there was a *"kulak"* element within it, *"the great majority are
not of that type."* [quoted by Berkman, **The Bolshevik Myth**, p. 187]
According to Gallina Makhno (Makhno's wife), when entering a town or
village it was *"always Makhno's practice to compel the rich peasants,
the **kulaki** , to give up their surplus wealth, which was then divided
among the poor, Makhno keeping a share for his army. Then he would call
a meeting of the villagers, address them on the purposes of the
**povstantsi** [partisan] movement, and distribute his literature."*
[Emma Goldman, **My Disillusionment in Russia**, p. 149]

However, this would be replying to Trotsky's assertions with testimony
which was obviously pro-Makhnovist. As such, we need to do more than
this, we need to refute Trotsky's assertions in depth, drawing on as
many non-anarchist sources and facts as possible.

The key to refuting Trotsky's argument that the Makhnovists were just
kulaks is to understand the nature of rural life before and during 1917.
Michael Malet estimates that in 1917, the peasantry could be divided
into three broad categories. About 40 percent could no longer make a
living off their land or had none, another 40 per cent who could make
ends meet, except in a bad year, and 20 per cent who were relatively
well off, with a fraction at the very top who were very well off. [**Op.
Cit.**, p. 117] Assuming that *"kulak"* simply meant *"rich"* or
*"well-off"* peasant, then Trotsky is arguing that the Makhnovist
movement represented and was based on this top 20 per cent. However, if
we take the term *"kulak"* to mean *"small rural capitalist"* (i.e.
employer of wage labour) then this figure would be substantially smaller
as few within this group would employ hired labour or rent land. In
fact, the percentage of peasant households in Russia employing permanent
wage-labour was 3.3% in 1917, falling to 1% in 1920. [Teodor Shanin,
**The Awkward Class**, p. 171]

In 1917, the peasants all across the Russian Empire took back the land
stolen by the landlords. This lead to two developments. Firstly, there
was a *"powerful levelling effect"* in rural life. [Shanin, **Op.
Cit.**, p. 159] Secondly, the peasants would only support those who
supported their aspirations for land reform (which was why the
Bolsheviks effectively stole the Socialist-Revolutionary land policy in
1917). The Ukraine was no different. In 1917 the class structure in the
countryside changed when the Hulyai Pole peasants were amongst the first
to seize the landlords' land. In August 1917 Makhno assembled all the
landed gentry (*"**pomeshchiks**"*) of the region *"and made them give
him all the documents relating to lands and buildings."* After making an
exact inventory of all this property and presenting a report to the
local and then district congress of soviets, he *"proceeded to equalise
the rights of the **pomeshchiks** and **kulaks** with those of the poor
peasant labourers in regard to the use of the land . . . the congress
decided to let the **pomeshchiks** and **kulaks** have a share of the
land, as well as tools and livestock, equal to that of the labourers."*
Several other peasant congresses nearby followed this example and
adopted the same measure. [Peter Arshinov, **Op. Cit.**, pp. 53-4]

Most of this land, tools and livestock was distributed to poor peasants,
the rest was used to set up voluntary communes where the peasants
themselves (and not the state) self-managed the land. Thus the peasants'
*"economic conditions in the region of the Makhno movement were greatly
improved at the expense of the landlords, the church, monasteries, and
the richest peasants."* [Palij, **Op. Cit.**, p. 214] This
redistribution was based on the principle that every peasant was
entitled to as much land as their family could cultivate without the use
of hired labour. The abolition of wage labour in the countryside was
also the method the anarchists were to use in Spain to divide up the
land some 20 years later.

We should also note that the Makhnovist policy of land reform based on
the abolition of wage labour was, as we noted in [section
7](append46.html#app7), the position agreed at the second regional
congress called in 1919. The Makhnovists specifically argued with
regards to the kulaks:

> *"We are sure that . . . the kulak elements of the village will be
> pushed to one side by the very course of events. The toiling peasantry
> will itself turn effortlessly on the kulaks, first by adopting the
> kulak's surplus land for general use, then naturally drawing the kulak
> elements into the social organisation."* [cited by Michael Malet,
> **Op. Cit.**, pp. 118-9]

As such, when Trotsky talks about the *"downtrodden village poor whom
the October revolution first awakened,"* he is wrong. In the area around
Hulyai Pole it was **not** the October revolution which *"first
awakened"* them into action, it was the activities of Makhno and the
anarchists during the summer and autumn of 1917 which had done that (or,
more correctly, it was their activities which aided this process as the
poor peasants and landless workers needed no encouragement to
expropriate the landlords).

Needless to say, this land redistribution reinforced Makhno's popularity
with the people and was essential for the army's later popularity and
its ability to depend on the peasants for support. However, the
landlords and richer kulaks did not appreciate it and, unsurprisingly,
tried to crush the movement when they could. Once the Austro-Germans
invaded, the local rich took the opportunity to roll back the social
revolution and the local **pomeshchiks** and **kulaks** formed a
*"special volunteer detachment"* to fight Makhno once he had returned
from exile in July 1918. [Arshinov, **Op. Cit.**, p. 59]

This system of land reform did not seek to divide the village. Indeed,
the Makhnovist approach is sometimes called the *"united village"*
theory. Rather than provoke unnecessary and damaging conflict behind the
frontlines, land reform would be placed in the hands of the village
community, which would ensure that even the kulaks would have a fair
stake in the post-revolutionary society as everyone would have as much
land as they could till without using hired labour. The Bolshevik
policy, as we will see, aimed at artificially imposing "class conflict"
upon the villages from without and was a disaster as it was totally
alien to the actual socio-economic situation. Unsurprisingly, peasant
communities **as a whole** rose up against the Bolsheviks all across
Russia.

As such, the claim that the Makhnovists were simply *"kulaks"* is false
as it fails to, firstly, acknowledge the actual pre-revolutionary
composition of the peasantry and, secondly, to understand the
social-revolution that had happened in the region of Hulyai Pole in 1917
and, thirdly, totally ignores the actual Makhnovist position on land
reform. As Michael Malet argues, the Bolsheviks *"totally misconstrued
the nature of the Makhno movement. It was not a movement of kulaks, but
of the broad mass of the peasants, especially the poor and middle
peasants."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 122]

This was sometimes acknowledged by Bolsheviks themselves. IAkovlev
acknowledged in 1920 that in 1919 Makhno *"was a real peasant idol, an
expression of all peasant spontaneity against . . . Communists in the
cities and simultaneously against city capitalists and landowners. In
the Makhno movement it is difficult to distinguish where the poor
peasant begins [and] the 'kulak' ends. It was a spontaneous peasant
movement .. . . In the village we had no foothold, there was not one
element with which we could join that would be our ally in the struggle
against the bandits [sic!]."* [quoted by Palij, **Op. Cit.**, p. 157]

According to a Soviet author present at the Makhnovist regional
congresses on January 23 and February 12: *"In 1919 when I asked the
chairman of the two Congresses (a Jewish farmer) whether the 'kulaks'
were allowed to participate in the Congress, he angrily responded: 'When
will you finally stop talking about kulaks? Now we have no kulaks among
us: everybody is tilling as much land as he wishes and as much as he
can.'"* [quoted by Palij, **Op. Cit.**, p. 293]

According to Christian Rakovskii, the Bolshevik ruler of Ukraine,
*"three-fourths of the membership of the [partisan] bands were poor
peasants."* He presented a highly original and inventive explanation of
this fact by arguing that *"rich peasants stayed in the village and paid
poor ones to fight. Poor peasants were the hired army of the kulaks."*
[Vladimir N. Brovkin, **Behind the Front the Lines of the Civil War**,
p. 112 and p. 328]

Even Trotsky (himself the son of a rich peasant!) let the cat out of the
bag in 1919:

> *"The liquidation of Makhno does not mean the end of the
> Makhnovschyna, which has its roots in the ignorant popular masses."*
> [quoted by Malet, **Op. Cit.**, p. 122]

Ultimately, all sources (including Bolshevik ones) accept that in the
autumn of 1919 (at the very least) Makhno's support was overwhelming and
came from all sections of the population.

Even ignoring the fact there was a social revolution and the eye-witness
Bolshevik accounts (including Trotsky's!) which contradict Trotsky's
assertions, Trotsky can be faulted for other reasons.

The most important issue is simply that the Makhnovist movement could
not have survived four years if (at best) 20 per cent of the population
supported it. As Christopher Reed notes, when the Makhnovists were *"in
retreat they would abandon their weapons and merge with the local
population. The fact that they were able to succeed shows how closely
they were linked with the ordinary peasants because such tactics made
Makhno's men very vulnerable to informers. There were very few examples
of betrayal."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 260] If Makhno's social base was as
weak as claimed there would have been no need for the Bolsheviks to
enter into alliances with him, particularly in the autumn of 1920 when
the Makhnovists held no significant liberated area. Even after the
defeat of Wrangel and the subsequent Bolshevik betrayal and repression,
Makhno's mass base allowed him to remain active for months. Indeed, it
was only when the peasants themselves had become exhausted in 1921 due
to worsening economic conditions and state repression, were the
Makhnovists finally forced into exile.

In the attempt to *"eradicate his influence in the countryside"* the
Bolsheviks *"by weight of numbers and consistent ruthlessness they
achieved a partial success."* This was achieved by state terrorism:

> *"On the occupation of a village by the Red Army the **Cheka** would
> hunt out and hang all active Makhnovist supporters; an amenable Soviet
> would be set up; officials would be appointed or imported to organise
> the poor peasants . . . and three or four Red militia men left as
> armed support for the new village bosses."* [David Footman, **Op.
> Cit.**, p. 292]

Moreover, in these *"military operations the Bolsheviks shot all
prisoners. The Makhnovists shot all captured officers unless the Red
rank and file strongly interceded for them. The rank and file were
usually sent home, though a number volunteered for service with the
Insurgents. Red Army reports complain of poor morale . . . The Reds used
a number of Lettish and Chinese troops to decrease the risk of
fraternisation."* [Footman, **Op. Cit.**, p. 293] If the Makhnovists
were made up of kulaks, why would the Bolsheviks fear fraternisation?
Equally, if the Makhnovists were "kulaks" then how could they have such
an impact on Red Army troops (who were mostly poor peasants)? After all,
Trotsky had been complaining that "Makhnovism" had been infecting nearby
Red Army troops and in August 1919 was arguing that it was *"still a
poison which has infected backward units in the Ukrainian army."* In
December 1919, he noted that *"disintegration takes place in unstable
units of our army when they came into contact with Makhno's forces."* It
seems unlikely that a movement made up of "kulaks" could have such an
impact. Moreover, as Trotsky noted, not all Makhnovists were anarchists,
*"some of them wrongly regard themselves as Communists."* Again, why
would people who regarded themselves as Communists join a movement of
"kulaks"? [**How the Revolution Armed**, vol. II, p. 367, p. 110 and p.
137]

In addition, it seems highly unlikely (to say the least!) that a
movement which is alleged to be either made up of or supported by the
kulaks could have had a land policy which emphasised and implemented an
equal share for the poorest peasantry, not just of land but also of live
and dead stock as well as opposing the hiring of labour. This fact is
reinforced when we look at the peasant reaction to the Bolshevik (and,
presumably, anti-kulak and pro-"downtrodden village poor") land policy.
Simply put, their policies resulted in massive peasant unrest directed
against the Bolsheviks.

The Bolshevik land decrees of the 5th and 11th of February, 1919, stated
that large landlord holdings would become state farms and all stock was
to be taken over by the Ministry of Agriculture, with only between one
third and one half of the land being reserved for poor peasants. This
was *"largely irrelevant, since the peasantry had expected, and in some
cases already controlled, all of it. To them, the government was taking
away their land, and not seizing it from the landlords, then keeping
some of it and handing the rest over to its rightful owners."* [Malet,
**Op. Cit.**, p. 134] Thus the land was to expropriated by the state,
**not** by the peasants. The result of this policy soon became clear:

> *"The Bolsheviks expropriation policy was countervailed by the
> peasants' resistance based upon their assumption that 'the land
> belongs to nobody . . . it can be used only by those who care about
> it, who cultivate it.' Thus the peasants maintained that all the
> property of the former landlords was now by right their own. This
> attitude was shared not only by the rich and middle peasants but also
> the poor and landless, for they all wished to be independent farmers.
> The poorer the areas, the more dissatisfied were the peasants with the
> Bolshevik decrees.*
> "Thus Communist agricultural policy and terrorism brought about a
> strong reaction against the new Bolshevik regime. By the middle of
> 1919, all peasants, rich and poor, distrusted the Bolsheviks." [Palij,
> **Op. Cit.**, p. 156]

The Bolshevik inspired Poor Peasant Committees were *"associated with
this disastrous policy, were discredited, and their reintroduction would
need the aid of troops."* [Malet, **Op. Cit.**, p. 135] The Makhnovists,
in contrast, did not impose themselves onto the villages, nor did they
attempt to tell the peasants what to do and how to divide the land.
Rather they advocated the formation of Free Soviets through which these
decisions could be made. This, along with their support for land reform,
helped win them mass support.

After evacuating the Ukraine in mid-1919 due to the success of Denikin's
counter-revolution, the Ukrainian Communists took time to mull over what
had happened. The Central Committee's November 1919 resolution on the
Ukraine *"gave top priority to the middle peasant -- so often and so
conveniently lumped in together with the kulak and dealt with
accordingly -- the transfer of landlord land to the poor peasants with
only minimum exceptions for state farms."* These points were the basis
of the new Ukrainian land law of 5th of February, 1920. [Malet, **Op.
Cit.**, p. 135] This new law reflected long standing Makhnovist theory
**and** practice. Therefore, the changing nature of Bolshevik land
policy in the Ukraine indicates that Trotsky's claims are false. The
very fact that the Bolsheviks had to adjust their policies in line with
Makhnovist theory indicates that the later appealed to the middle and
poor peasants.

Equally, it seems strange that the *"kulaks"* who apparently dominated
the movement should have let themselves be led by poor peasants and
workers. Voline presents a list of some of the participants of the
movement and the vast majority are either peasants or workers. [**Op.
Cit.**, pp. 688-91] As historian Michael Palij notes, *"[a]lmost to a
man, they [the Makhnovist leadership] were of poor peasant origin, with
little formal education."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 254] Exceptions to the
general rule were usually workers. Most were Anarchists or
Socialist-Revolutionaries. [Palij, **Op. Cit.**, pp. 254-62]

Of course, it can be argued that the leadership of a movement need not
come from the class which it claims to lead. The leadership of the
Bolsheviks, for example, had very few actual proletarians within it.
However, it seems unlikely that a class would select as its leaders
members of the population it oppressed! Equally, it seems as unlikely
that poor peasants and workers would let themselves lead a movement of
kulaks, whose aims would be alien to theirs. After all, poor peasants
would seek land reform while kulaks would view this as a threat to their
social position. As can be seen from the Makhnovist land policy, they
argued for (and implemented) radical land reform, placing the land into
the hands of peasants who worked the land without hiring labour (see
[section 7](append46.html#app7))

As regards Trotsky's argument that the Makhnovists had to be kulaks
because they originally formed a cavalry unit, it is easy to refute.
Makhno himself was the son of poor peasants, an agricultural labourer
and a worker in a factory. He was able to ride a horse, so why could
other poor peasants not do so? Ultimately, it simply shows that Trotsky
knew very little of Ukrainian peasant life and society.

Given that the Bolshevik government was meant to be a "worker-peasant"
power, it seems strange that Trotsky dismisses the concerns of the
peasantry so. He should have remembered that peasant uprisings against
the Bolshevik government occurred constantly under the Bolsheviks,
forcing them (eventually) to, first, recognise the false nature of their
peasant policies in 1919 and, second, to introduce the NEP in 1921. As
such, it seems somewhat ironic for Trotsky to attack the Makhnovists for
not following flawed Bolshevik ideology as regards the peasantry!

The Bolsheviks, as Marxists, saw the peasants as "petit bourgeoisie" and
uninterested in the revolution except as a means to grab their own plot
of land. Their idea of land collectivisation was limited to state
ownership. The initial Bolshevik land strategy can be summed up as
mobilising the poor peasantry against the rest on the one hand and
mobilising the city worker against the peasants (through forced grain
confiscation on the other). The lack of knowledge of peasant life was
the basis of this policy, which was abandoned in 1919 when it was soon
proven to be totally wrong. Rather than see wealth extremes rise, the
1917 revolution saw a general levelling.

As regards the peasantry, here as elsewhere the Bolsheviks claimed their
strategy was the objectively necessary (only possible) one in the
circumstances. And here again the Makhnovists demonstrate this to be
false, as the Bolsheviks themselves acknowledged in practice by changing
their agricultural policies and bringing them closer to the Makhnovist
position.

Clearly, both factually and logically, Trotsky's arguments are false.
Ultimately, like most Bolsheviks, Trotsky uses the term *"kulak"* as a
meaningless term of abuse, with no relation to the actual class
structure of peasant life. It simply means a peasant opposed to the
Bolsheviks rather than an actual social strata. Essentially, he is using
the standard Leninist technique of specifying a person's class (or
ideas) based on whether they subscribe to (or simply follow without
question) Leninist ideology (see [section H.2.12](secH2.html#sech212)
for further discussion of this). This explains why the Makhnovists went
from being heroic revolutionaries to kulak bandits (and back again!)
depending on whether their activity coincided with the needs of
Bolshevik power or not. Expediency is not a sound base to build a
critique, particularly one based simply on assertions like Trotsky's.

9 Were the Makhnovists anti-Semitic and pogromists?
---------------------------------------------------

No, they were not. Anyone who claims that the Mahnovist movement was
anti-Semitic or conducted pogroms against Jews simply shows ignorance or
a desire to deceive. As we will show, the Makhnovists were both
theoretically and practically opposed to anti-Semitism and progroms.

Unsurprisingly, many Leninists slander the Makhnovists on this score.
Trotsky, for example, asserted in 1937 that Makhno's followers expressed
*"a militant anti-Semitism."* [Lenin and Trotsky, **Kronstadt**, p. 80]
Needless to say, the Trotskyist editors of the book in question did not
indicate that Trotsky was wrong in the accusation. In this way a slander
goes unchecked and becomes "accepted" as being true. As the charge of
*"militant anti-Semitism"* is a serious one, so it is essential that we
(unlike Trotsky) provide evidence to refute it.

To do so we will present a chronological overview of the evidence
against it. This will, to some degree, result in some duplication as
well as lengthy quotations, however it is unavoidable. We are sorry to
labour this point, but this allegation is sadly commonplace and it is
essential to refute it fully.

Unsurprisingly, Arshinov's 1923 account of the movement takes on the
allegations that the Makhnovists were anti-Semitic. He presents
extensive evidence to show that the Makhnovists opposed anti-Semitism
and pogroms. It is worth quoting him at length:

> pictured as a very restricted guerrilla movement, foreign to ideas of
> brotherhood and international solidarity, and even tainted with
> anti-Semitism. Nothing could be more criminal than such slanders. In

Arshinov then goes on to quote an appeal published by Makhnovists
together with anarchists referring to an anti-Semitic incident which
took place in the spring of 1919. It is called **WORKERS, PEASANTS AND
INSURGENTS FOR THE OPPRESSED, AGAINST THE OPPRESSORS -- ALWAYS!**:

> *"During the painful days of reaction, when the situation of the
> Ukrainian peasants was especially difficult and seemed hopeless, you
> were the first to rise as fearless and unconquerable fighters for the
> great cause of the liberation of the working masses. . . This was the

> But harmful and criminal elements succeeded in insinuating themselves

>
> "Peasants, workers and insurgents! You know that the workers of all

> Jewish banker, the Polish aristocrat .. . . The bourgeoisie of all

> all nationalities.
>
> "Peasants, workers and insurgents! At this moment when the
> international enemy -- the bourgeoisie of all countries -- hurries to
> the Russian revolution to create nationalist hatred among the mass of
> workers in order to distort the revolution and to shake the very
> foundation of our class struggle - the solidarity and unity of all

>
> "The path toward the emancipation of the workers can be reached by the
> union of all the workers of the world." [quoted by Arshinov, **Op.
> Cit.**, 215-7]

Arshinov also quotes an order issued by Makhno to *"all revolutionary
insurgents without exception"* which states, in part, that the *"goal of
our revolutionary army, and of every insurgent participating in it, is
an honourable struggle for the full liberation of the Ukrainian workers
from all oppression."* This was *"why every insurgent should constantly
keep in mind that there is no place among us for those who, under the
cover of the revolutionary insurrection, seek to satisfy their desires
for personal profit, violence and plunder at the expense of the peaceful
Jewish population."* [quoted by Arshinov, **Op. Cit.**, pp. 217-8]

Unsurprisingly, as an anarchist, Makhno presents a class analysis of the
problem of racism, arguing as follows:

> *"Every revolutionary insurgent should remember that his personal
> enemies as well as the enemies of all the people are the rich
> bourgeoisie, regardless of whether they be Russian, or Jewish, or
> Ukrainian. The enemies of the working people are also those who
> protect the unjust bourgeois regime, i.e., the Soviet Commissars, the
> members of repressive expeditionary corps, the Extraordinary
> Commissions which go through the cities and villages torturing the
> working people who refuse to submit to their arbitrary dictatorship.
> Every insurgent should arrest and send to the army staff all
> representatives of such expeditionary corps, Extraordinary Commissions
> and other institutions which oppress and subjugate the people; if they
> resist, they should be shot on the spot. As for any violence done to
> peaceful workers of whatever nationality - such acts are unworthy of
> any revolutionary insurgent, and the perpetrator of such acts will be
> punished by death."* [quoted by Arshinov, **Op. Cit.**, p. 218]

It should also be noted that the chairmen of three Makhnovist regional
congresses were Jewish. The first and second congresses had a Jewish
chairman [Palij, **Op. Cit.**, p. 293], while Voline was the chair for
the fourth one held at Aleksandrovsk. Similarly, one of the heads of the
army's counter-espionage section was Jewish. [Arshinov, **Op. Cit.**, p.
212] Little wonder both Arshinov and Voline stress that an important
role was played by Jews within the movement.

The Jewish American anarchists Alexander Berkman and Emma Goldman were
also in Russia and the Ukraine during the revolution. Between 1920 and
1921, they were in contact with anarchists involved with the Makhnovists
and were concerned to verify what they had heard about the movement from
Bolshevik and other sources. Berkman recounts meeting the Jewish
anarchist Yossif the Emigrant (shot by the Bolsheviks in late 1920).
Yossif stated that *"Nestor is merciless toward those guilty of
Jew-baiting. Most of you have read his numerous proclamations against
pogroms, and you know how severely he punishes such things."* He
stressed that any stories of atrocities and pogroms committed by the
Makhnovists were *"lies wilfully spread by the Bolsheviks"* who *"hate
Nestor worse than they do Wrangel."* For Yossif, *"Makhno represents the
real spirit of October."* [quoted by Berkman, **Op. Cit.**, pp. 187-9]
He also notes that Gallina Makhno, Nestor's wife, would *"slightly raise
her voice in indignation when reports of Jew-baiting by **povstantsi**
[partisans] were mentioned. These stories were deliberately spread by
the Bolsheviki, she averred. No-one could be more severe in punishing
such excesses than Nestor. Some of his best comrades are Jews; there are
a number of them in the Revolutionary Soviet and in other branches of
the army. Few men are so loved and respected by the **povstantsi** as
Yossif the Emigrant, who is a Jew, and Makhno's best friend."* [Berkman,
**Op. Cit.**, pp. 238-9] Both Goldman and Berkman became friends with
Makhno during his exile in Paris.

After his exile, Makhno himself spent time refuting allegations of
anti-Semitism. Two articles on this subject are contained in **The
Struggle Against the State and other Essays**, a collection of Makhno's
exile writings. In the article *"The Makhnovshchina and Anti-Semitism"*
he recounts various examples of the *"uncompromising line on the
anti-Semitism of pogromists"* which the Makhnovists took *"throughout
its entire existence."* This was *"because it was a genuinely
revolutionary toilers' movement in the Ukraine."* He stressed that
*"[a]t no time did the movement make it its business to carry out
pogroms against Jews nor did it ever encourage any."* [**The Struggle
Against the State and Other Essays**, p. 38 and p. 34] He wrote another
article (called *"To the Jews of All Countries"*):

> *"In my first 'Appeal to Jews, published in the French libertarian
> newspaper, **Le Libertaire**, I asked Jews in general, which is to say
> the bourgeois and the socialist ones as well as the 'anarchist' ones
> like Yanovsky, who have all spoken of me as a pogromist against Jews
> and labelled as anti-Semitic the liberation movement of the Ukrainian
> peasants and workers of which I was the leader, to detail to me the
> specific facts instead of blathering vacuously away: just where and
> just when did I or the aforementioned movement perpetrate such acts? .
> . . Thus far, no such evidence advanced by Jews has come to my
> attention. The only thing that has appeared thus far in the press
> generally, certain Jewish anarchist organs included, regarding myself
> and the insurgent movement I led, has been the product of the most
> shameless lies and of the vulgarity of certain political mavericks and
> their hirelings."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 28]

It should be noted that Yanovsky, editor of the Yiddish language
anarchist paper **Freie Arbeiter Stimme** later admitted that Makhno was
right. Yanovsky originally believed the charges of anti-Semitism made
against Makhno, going so far as ignoring Makhno's appeal to him out of
hand. However, by the time of Makhno's death in 1934, Yanovsky had
learned the truth:

> *"So strongly biased was I against him [Makhno] at that time I did not
> think it necessary to find out whether my serious accusation was
> founded on any real facts during the period of his great fight for
> real freedom in Russia. Now I know that my accusations of
> anti-Semitism against Makhno were built entirely on the lies of the
> Bolsheviks and to the rest of their crimes must be added this great
> crime of killing his greatness and the purity of this fighter for
> freedom."*

Due to this, he could not forgive himself for *"so misjudg[ing] a man
merely on the basis of calumny by his bitter enemies who more than once
shamefully betrayed him, and against whom he fought so heroically."* He
also notes that it had *"become known to me that a great many Jewish
comrades were heart and soul with Makhno and the whole Makhno movement.
Amongst them was one whom I knew well personally, Joseph Zutman of
Detroit, and I know that he would not have had anything to do with
persons, or a movement, which possessed the slightest leaning towards
anti-Semitism."* [*"appendix,"* **My Visit to the Kremlin**, pp. 36-7]

However, by far the best source to refute claims of anti-Semitism the
work of the Jewish anarchist Voline. He summarises the extensive
evidence against such claims:

> *"We could cover dozens of pages with extensive and irrefutable proofs
> of the falseness of these assertions. We could mention articles and
> proclamations by Makhno and the Council of Revolutionary Insurgents
> denouncing anti-Semitism. We could tell of spontaneous acts by Makhno
> himself and other insurgents against the slightest manifestation of
> the anti-Semitic spirit on the part of a few isolated and misguided
> unfortunates in the army and the population. . . One of the reasons
> for the execution of Grigoriev by the Makhnovists was his
> anti-Semitism and the immense pogrom he organised at Elizabethgrad . .
> .*
>
> "We could cite a whole series of similar facts, but we do not find it
> necessary . . . and will content ourselves with mentioning briefly the
> following essential facts:
>
> "1. A fairly important part in the Makhnovist movement was played by
> revolutionists of Jewish origin.
>
> "2. Several members of the Education and Propaganda Commission were
> Jewish.
>
> "3. Besides many Jewish combatants in various units of the army, there
> was a battery composed entirely of Jewish artillery men and a Jewish
> infantry unit.
>
> "4. Jewish colonies in the Ukraine furnished many volunteers to the
> Insurrectionary Army.
>
> "5. In general the Jewish population, which was very numerous in the
> Ukraine, took an active part in all the activities of the movement.
> The Jewish agricultural colonies which were scattered throughout the
> districts of Mariupol, Berdiansk, Alexandrovsk, etc., participated in
> the regional assemblies of workers, peasants and partisans; they sent
> their delegates to the regional Revolutionary Military Council.
>
> "6. Rich and reactionary Jews certainly had to suffer from the
> Makhnovist army, not as Jews, but just in the same way as non-Jewish
> counter-revolutionaries." [**The Unknown Revolution**, pp. 967-8]

However, it could be claimed that these accounts are from anarchists and
so are biased. Ignoring the question of why so many Jewish anarchists
should defend Makhno if he was, in fact, a pogromist or anti-Semite, we
can turn to non-anarchist sources for confirmation of the fact that
Makhno and the Makhnovist movement were not anti-Semites.

First, we turn to Voline, who quotes the eminent Jewish writer and
historian M. Tcherikover about the question of the Makhnovists and
anti-Semitism. Tcherikover had, for a number of years, had specialised
in research on the persecutions of the Jews in Russia. The Jewish
historian states *"with certainty that, on the whole, the behaviour of
Makhno's army cannot be compared with that of the other armies which
were operating in Russian during the events 1917-21. Two facts I can
certify absolutely explicitly.*

"1. It is undeniable that, of all these armies, including the Red Army,
the Makhnovists behaved best with regard the civil population in general
and the Jewish population in particular. I have numerous testimonies to
this. The proportion of **justified** complaints against the Makhnovist
army, in comparison with the others, is negligible.

"2. Do not speak of pogroms alleged to have been organised by Makhno
himself. That is a slander or an error. Nothing of the sort occurred. As
for the Makhnovist Army, I have had hints and precise denunciations on
this subject. But, up to the present, every time I have tried to check
the facts, I have been obliged to declare that on the day in question no
Makhnovist unit could have been at the place indicated, the whole army
being far away from there. Upon examining the evidence closely, I
established this fact, every time, with absolute certainty, at the place
and on the date of the pogrom, no **Makhnovist** unit was operating or
even located in the vicinity. **Not once** have I been able to prove the
existence of a Makhnovist unit at the place a pogrom against the Jews
took place. Consequently, the pogroms in question could not have been
the work of the Makhnovists." [quoted by Voline, **Op. Cit.**, p. 699]

This conclusion is confirmed by later historians. Paul Avrich notes that
*"[c]harges of Jew-baiting and of anti-Jewish pogroms have come from
every quarter, left, right, and centre. Without exception, however, they
are based on hearsay, rumour, or intentional slander, and remain
undocumented and unproved."* He adds that the *"Soviet propaganda
machine was at particular pains to malign Makhno as a bandit and
pogromist."* Wishing to verify the conclusions of Tcherikover proved by
Voline, Avrich examined several hundred photographs in the Tcherikover
Collection, housed in the YIVO Library in New York and depicting
anti-Jewish atrocities in the Ukraine during the Civil War. He found
that *"only one [was] labelled as being the work of the Makhnovists,
though even here neither Makhno himself nor any of his recognisable
subordinates are to be seen, nor is there any indication that Makhno had
authorised the raid or, indeed, that the band involved was in fact
affiliated with his Insurgent Army."* Avrich then states that *"there is
evidence that Makhno did all in his power to counteract anti-Semitic
tendencies among his followers"* and that *"a considerable number of
Jews took part in the Makhnovist movement."* He also points out that the
Jewish anarchists Alexander Berkman, Emma Goldman, Sholem Schwartzbard,
Voline, Senya Fleshin, and Mollie Steimer did not criticise Makhno as an
anti-Semite, they also *"defended him against the campaign of slander
that persisted from all sides."* [**Anarchist Portraits**, pp. 122-3] It
should be noted that Schwartzbard assassinated the Nationalist leader
Petliura in 1926 because he considered him responsible for pogroms
conducted by Nationalist troops during the civil war. He shot Petliura
the day after he, Makhno and Berkman had seen him at a Russian
restaurant in Paris. [Malet, **Op. Cit.**, p. 189]

Michael Malet, in his account of the Makhnovists, states that *"there is
overwhelming evidence that Makhno himself was not anti-Semitic."* [**Op.
Cit.**, p. 168] He indicates that in the period January to September
1919, the Central Committee of Zionist Organisations in Russia listed
the Nationalists as creating 15,000 victims of pogroms, then the
Denikinists with 9,500 followed by Hryhoriyiv, Sokolovsky, Struk,
Yatsenko and Soviet troops (500 victims). Makhno is not mentioned. Of
the pogroms listed, almost all took place on the western Ukraine, where
the local otamany (warlords) and the Nationalists were strong. Very few
took place where Makhno's influence predominated, the nearest being in
Katerinoslav town and Kherson province; none in the provinces of
Katerinoslav or Tavria. It should also be noted that the period of
January to June of that year was one of stability within the Makhnovist
region, so allowing them the space to apply their ideas. Malet
summarises:

> *"Even granted the lower level of Jewish involvement in left-bank
> trade, the almost total lack of anti-Semitic manifestations would show
> that Makhno's appeals, at a time when anti-Semitism was fast becoming
> fashionable, did not go unheeded by the population. There were a
> number of Jewish colonies in the south-east Ukraine."* [**Op. Cit.**,
> p. 169]

Unsurprisingly, Malet notes that apart from certain personal
considerations (such as his friendship with a number of Jews, including
Voline and Yossif the Emigrant), *"the basis of Makhno's hostility to
anti-Semitism was his anarchism. Anarchism has always been an
international creed, explicitly condemning all forms of racial hatred as
incompatible with the freedom of individuals and the society of
equals."* And like other serious historians, he points to *"the
continual participation in the movement of both intellectual Jews from
outside, and Jews from the local colonies"* as *"further proof . . . of
the low level of anti-Semitism within the Makhnovshchina."* [**Op.
Cit.**, p. 171 and pp. 171-2]

Anarchist Serge Cipko summarises the literature by stating that the
*"scholarly literature that discusses Makhno's relationships with the
Jewish population is of the same opinion [that the Makhnovists were not
anti-Semitic] and concur that unlike the Whites, Bolsheviks and other
competing groups in Ukraine during the Revolution, the Makhnovists did
not engage in pogroms."* [*"Nestor Makhno: A Mini-Historiography of the
Anarchist Revolution in Ukraine, 1917-1921,"* pp. 57-75, **The Raven**,
no. 13, p. 62]

Historian Christopher Reed concurs, noting that *"Makhno actively
opposed anti-Semitism . . . Not surprisingly, many Jews held prominent
positions in the Insurgent movement and Jewish farmers and villagers
staunchly supported Makhno in the face of the unrestrained anti-Semitism
of Ukrainian nationalists like Grigoriev and of the Great Russian
chauvinists like the Whites."* [**Op. Cit.**, pp. 263-4] Arthur E. Adams
states that *"Makhno protected Jews and in fact had many serving on his
own staff."* [**Bolsheviks in the Urkaine**, p. 402]

We apologise again for labouring this point, but the lie that Makhno and
the Makhnovists were anti-Semitic is relatively commonplace and needs to
be refuted. As noted, Trotskyists repeat Trotsky's false assertions
without correction. Other repeat the lie from other sources. It was
essential, therefore, to spend time making the facts available and to
nail the lie of Makhnovist anti- Semitism once and for all!

10 Did the Makhnovists hate the city and city workers?
------------------------------------------------------

For some reason the Makhnovists have been portrayed as being against the
city and even history as such. This assertion is false, although
sometimes made. For example, historian Bruce Lincoln states that Makhno
*"had studied the anarchist writings of Bakunin, whose condemnation of
cities and large-scale industries fit so well with the anti-urban,
anti-industrial feelings of the Ukrainian peasants, and his program was
precisely the sort that struck responsive chords in peasant hearts."*
[**Red Victory**, p. 325] Lincoln fails to present any evidence for this
claim. This is unsurprising as it is doubtful that Makhno read such
condemnations in Bakunin as they do not, in fact, exist. Similarly, the
Makhnovist *"program"* (like anarchism in general) was not
*"anti-urban"* or *"anti-industrial."*

However, Lincoln's inventions are mild compared to Trotsky's. According
to Trotsky, *"the followers of Makhno"* were marked by *"hatred for the
city and the city worker."* He later gives some more concrete examples
of this *"hostility to the city"* which, as with the general peasant
revolt, also *"nourished the movement of Makhno, who seized and looted
trains marked for the factories, the plants, and the Red Army; tore up
railway tracks, shot Communists, etc."* [Lenin and Trotsky,
**Kronstadt**, p. 80 and p. 89]

Unsurprisingly, Trotsky simply shows his ignorance of the Makhno
movement by these statements. To refute Trotsky's claim we can simply
point to how the Makhnovists acted once they occupied a city. As we
discuss in [section 7](append46.html#app7), the first thing the
Makhnovists did was to call a conference of workers and urge them to
organise their own affairs directly, using their own class organs of
self-management (soviets, unions, etc.). Hardly the activity of a group
of people who allegedly *"hated"* city workers!

We can also point to the fact that the Makhnovists arranged direct
exchanges of goods between the towns and country. In early 1918, for
example, corn was shipped directly to a Moscow factory in return for
textiles (without state interference). In 1919, 1500 tons of grain (and
a small amount of coal) was sent by train to Petrograd and Moscow where
the commander of the train was to exchange it again for textiles. The
initiative in both cases came from the Hulyai Pole peasants. Again,
hardly the work of city-hating peasants.

Peter Arshinov indicates the underlying theory behind the Makhnovists as
regards the relations between city and country:

> *"The Makhnovshchina . . . understands that the victory and
> consolidation of the revolution . . . cannot be realised without a
> close alliance between the working classes of the cities and those of
> the countryside. The peasants understand that without urban workers
> and powerful industrial enterprises they will be deprived of most of
> the benefits which the social revolution makes possible. Furthermore,
> they consider the urban workers to be their brothers, members of the
> same family of workers.*
>
> "There can be no doubt that, at the moment of the victory of the
> social revolution, the peasants will give their entire support to the
> workers. This will be voluntary and truly revolutionary support given
> directly to the urban proletariat. In the present-day situation [under
> the Bolsheviks], the bread taken by force from the peasants nourishes
> mainly the enormous governmental machine. The peasants see and
> understand perfectly that this expensive bureaucratic machine is not
> in any way needed by them or by the workers, and that in relation to
> the workers it plays the same role as that of a prison administration

> desire to give their bread voluntarily to the State. This is why they
> are so hostile in their relations with the contemporary tax collectors
> -- the commissars and the various supply organs of the State.
>
> "But the peasants always try to enter into **direct** relations with
> the urban workers. The question was raised more than once at peasant
> congresses, and the peasants always resolved it in a revolutionary and
> positive manner." [**Op. Cit.**, p. 258]

Simply put, Trotsky misinterprets hostility to the repressive policies
of the Bolshevik dictatorship with hostility to the city.

Moreover, ignoring the **actual** relationships of the Makhnovists with
the city workers, we can fault Trotsky's arguments without resource to
such minor things as facts. This is because every one of his "examples"
of *"hatred for the city and the city worker"* can be explained by more
common sense arguments.

As regards the destruction of trains and railway tracks, a far simpler
and more plausible explanation can be found than Trotsky's *"hostility
to the city."* This is the fact that a civil war was taking place. Both
the Reds and Whites used armoured trains to move troops and as bases of
operations. To destroy the means by which your enemy attacks you is
common sense! Equally, in the chaotic times of the war, resources were
often in low supply and in order to survive the Makhnovists had to
*"loot"* trains (needless to say, Trotsky does not explain how the
Makhnovists knew the trains were *"marked for the factories."*). It
should be noted that the Bolsheviks *"looted"* the countryside, can we
surmise that the Bolsheviks simply expressed *"hostility to the
village"*?

As regards the shooting of Communists, a far simpler and more plausible
explanation also exists. Rather than show *"hostility to the city,"* it
shows *"hostility"* to the Communist Party, its policies and its
authoritarian ideas. Given that the Bolsheviks had betrayed the
Makhnovists on ***three*** occasions (see [section
13](append46.html#app13)) and attacked them, *"hostility"* to Communists
seems a sensible position to take! Equally, the first Bolshevik attack
on the Makhnovists occurred in mid-1919, when the Bolsheviks began
justifying their party dictatorship as essential for the success of the
revolution. The other two occurred in 1920, when the Bolsheviks were
announcing to the whole world at the Communist International (to quote
Zinoviev) that *"the dictatorship of the proletariat is at the same time
the dictatorship of the Communist Party."* [**Proceedings and Documents
of the Second Congress 1920**, vol. 1, p. 152] Given this, perhaps the
fact that the Makhnovists shot Communists can be explained in terms of
defence against Bolshevik betrayal and opposition to the dictatorship of
the Communist Party rather than *"hostility to the city."* Needless to
say, the Communists shot Makhnovists and anarchists. What does that
suggest a *"hostility"* to by the Bolsheviks? Working-class autonomy and
freedom?

Clearly, Trotsky was clutching at straws in his smearing of the
Makhnovist movement as haters of the city worker. The *"hostility"*
Trotsky speaks of can be far more easily explained in terms of the
necessities imposed upon the Makhnovists by the civil war and the
betrayals of the Bolsheviks. As such, it would be fairer to state that
the Makhnovists showed *"hostility"* or *"hatred"* to the city or city
workers only if you equate both with the Bolshevik party dictatorship.
In other words, the Makhnovists showed *"hostility"* to the new ruling
class of the Communist Party hierarchy.

All this does not mean that there were not misunderstandings between the
Makhno movement, a predominantly rural movement, and the workers in the
cities. Far from it. Equally, it can be said that the Makhnovists did
not understand the workings of an urban economy and society as well as
they understood their own. However, they made no attempt to **impose**
their world-view on the city workers (unlike the Bolsheviks, who did so
on both urban and rural workers). However, ignorance of the city and its
resulting misunderstandings do not constitute *"hostility"* or
*"hatred."*

Moreover, where these misunderstandings developed show that the claims
that the Makhnovists hated the city workers are simply false. Simply
put, the misunderstanding occurred when the Makhnovists had liberated
cities from the Whites. As we discussed in [section
7](append46.html#app7), the first thing the Makhnovists did was to call
a conference of workers' delegates to discuss the current situation and
to urge them to form soviets, unions and co-operatives in order to
manage their own affairs. This hardly shows *"hatred"* of the city
worker. In contrast, the first thing the Bolsheviks did in taking a city
was to form a *"revolutionary committee"* to govern the town and
implement Bolshevik policy.

This, needless to say, shows a distinct *"hostility"* to the city
workers on the part of the Bolsheviks. Equally, the Bolshevik advocacy
of party dictatorship to overcome the *"wavering"* of the working class.
In the words of Trotsky himself (in 1921):

> *"The Workers' Opposition has come out with dangerous slogans, making
> a fetish of democratic principles! They place the workers' right to
> elect representatives above the Party, as if the party were not
> entitled to assert its dictatorship even if that dictatorship
> temporarily clashed with the passing moods of the workers' democracy.
> It is necessary to create amongst us the awareness of the
> revolutionary birthright of the party. which is obliged to maintain
> its dictatorship, regardless of temporary wavering even in the working
> classes. This awareness is for us the indispensable element. The
> dictatorship does not base itself at every given moment on the formal
> principle of a workers' democracy."* [quoted by Samuel Farber,
> **Before Stalinism**, p. 209]

Opposing workers' democracy because working people could make decisions
that the party thought were wrong shows a deep *"hostility"* to the
**real** city workers and their liberty and equality. Equally, Bolshevik
repression of workers' strikes, freedom of speech, assembly,
organisation and self-determination shows far more *"hostility"* to the
city worker than a few Makhnovist misunderstandings!

All in all, any claim that the Makhnovists *"hated"* city workers is
simply false. While some Makhnovists may not have liked the city nor
really understood the complexities of an urban economy, they did
recognise the importance of encouraging working-class autonomy and
self-organisation within them and building links between the rural and
urban toilers. While the lack of a large-scale anarcho-syndicalist
movement hindered any positive construction, the Makhnovists at least
tried to promote urban self-management. Given Bolshevik authoritarianism
and its various rationalisations, it would be fairer to say that it was
the Bolsheviks who expressed *"hostility"* to the city workers by
imposing their dictatorship upon them rather than supporting
working-class self-management as the Makhnovists did!

11 Were the Makhnovists nationalists?
-------------------------------------

Some books on the Makhnovist movement try to present the Makhnovists as
being Ukrainian nationalists. A few discuss the matter in order,
perhaps, to increase the respectability of the Makhnovist movement by
associating it with a more *"serious"* and *"respectable"* political
theory than anarchism, namely *"Nationalism."* Those who seriously
investigate the issue come to the same conclusion, namely that neither
Makhno nor the Makhnovist movement was nationalist (see, for example,
Frank Sysyn's essay **Nestor Makhno and the Ukrainian Revolution** which
discusses this issue).

Therefore, any claims that the Makhnovists were nationalists are
incorrect. The Makhnovist movement was first and foremost an
internationalist movement of working people. This is to be expected as
anarchists have long argued that nationalism is a cross-class movement
which aims to maintain the existing class system but without foreign
domination (see [section D.6](secD6.html) for details). As such, the
Makhnovists were well aware that nationalism could not solve the social
question and would simply replace a Russian ruling class and state with
a Ukrainian one.

This meant that the aims of the Makhnovists went further than simply
national liberation or self-determination. Anarchists, rather, aim for
working-class self-liberation and self-determination, both as
individuals and as groups, as well as politically, economically and
socially. To quote Makhno's wire to Lenin in December 1918, the
Makhnovist *"aims are known and clear to all. They are fighting against
the authority of all political governments and for liberty and
independence of the working people."* [quoted by Palij, **Op. Cit.**, p.
80]

From this class and anti-hierarchical perspective, it is not
unsurprising that the Makhnovists were not nationalists. They did not
seek Ukrainian independence but rather working- class autonomy. This, of
necessity, meant they opposed all those who aimed to govern and/or
exploit the working class. Hence Arshinov:

> *"Composed of the poorest peasants, who were united by the fact that
> they all worked with their own hands, the Makhnovist movement was
> founded on the deep feeling of fraternity which characterises only the
> most oppressed. During its entire history it did not for an instant
> appeal to national sentiments. The whole struggle of the Makhnovists
> against the Bolsheviks was conducted solely in the name of the rights
> and interests of the workers. Denikin's troops, the Austro-Germans,
> Petliura, the French troops in Berdyansk, Wrangel -- were all treated
> by the Makhnovists as enemies of the workers. Each one of these
> invasions represented for them essentially a threat to the workers,
> and the Makhnovists had no interest in the national flag under which
> they marched."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 210]

He stressed that *"national prejudices had no place in the
Makhnovshchina. There was also no place in the movement for religious
prejudices . . . Among modern social movements, the Makhnovshchina was
one of the few in which an individual had absolutely no interest in his
own or his neighbour's religion or nationality, in which he respected
only the labour and the freedom of the worker."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 211]

The Makhnovists made their position on nationalism clear in the
'Declaration' published by the Revolutionary Military Council of the
army in October, 1919:

> *"When speaking of Ukrainian independence, we do not mean national
> independence in Petliura's sense but the social independence of
> workers and peasants. We declare that Ukrainian, and all other,
> working people have the right to self-determination not as an
> 'independent nation' but as 'independent workers'"* [quoted by
> Arshinov, **Op. Cit.**, p. 210]

In other words, the Makhnovists *"declared, that in their option
**Petlurovtchina** [the Petliura movement, Petliura being the leader of
the Nationalists] was a bourgeois nationalist movement whose road was
entirely different from that of the revolutionary peasants, that the
Ukraine should be organised on a basis of free labour and the
independence of the peasants and the workers . . . and that nothing but
struggle was possible between the **Makhnovitchina** , the movement of
the workers, and the **Petlurovtchina** , the movement of the
bourgeoisie."* [Voline, **Op. Cit.**, p. 572]

This does not mean that anarchists are indifferent to cultural and
national domination and oppression. Far from it! As we discussed in
sections [D.6](secD6.html) and [D.7](secD7.html), anarchists are against
foreign domination and cultural imperialism, believing that every
community or national group has the right to be itself and develop as it
sees fit. This means that anarchists seek to transform national
liberation struggles into **human** liberation struggles, turning any
struggle against foreign oppression and domination into a struggle
against **all** forms of oppression and domination.

This means that the Makhnovists, like anarchists in general, seek to
encourage local culture and language while opposed nationalism. As Frank
Sysyn argues, it *"would be a mistake . . . to label the Makhnivtsi as
'anti-Ukrainian.' Although they opposed the political goals of most
'svidomi ukraintsi' (nationally conscious Ukrainians), they accepted the
existence of a Ukrainian nation and used the terms 'Ukraine' and
'Ukrainian.'"* [**Nestor Makhno and the Ukrainian Revolution**, p. 288]
It should be noted that opponents of Ukrainian independence generally
called it the *"south of Russia"* or *"Little Russia."*

Thus an opposition to nationalism did not imply a rejection or blindness
to foreign domination and free cultural expression. On the question of
the language to be taught in schools, the Cultural-Educational Section
of the Makhnovist Insurgent Army wrote the following in October, 1919:

> *"The cultural-educational section of the Makhnovist army constantly
> receives questions from school teachers asking about the language in
> which instruction should be given in the schools, now that Denikin's
> troops have been expelled.*
>
> "The revolutionary insurgents, holding to the principles of true
> socialism, cannot in any field or by any measure do violence to the
> natural desires and needs of the Ukrainian people. This is why the
> question of the language to be taught in the schools cannot be solved
> by our army, but can only be decided by the people themselves, by
> parents, teachers and students
>
> "It goes without saying that all the orders of Denikin's so-called
> 'Special Bureau' as well as General Mai-Maevsky's order No. 22, which
> forbids the use of the mother tongue in the schools, are null and
> void, having been forcibly imposed on the schools.
>
> "In the interest of the greatest intellectual development of the
> people, the language of instruction should be that toward which the
> local population naturally tends, and this is why the population, the
> students, the teachers and the parents, and not authorities or the
> army, should freely and independently resolve this question." [quoted
> by Arshinov, **Op. Cit.**, pp. 210-1]

They also printed a Ukrainian version of their paper (*"The Road to
Freedom"*).

Clearly their opposition to Ukrainian nationalism did not mean that the
Makhnovists were indifferent to imperialism and foreign political or
cultural domination. This explains why Makhno criticised his enemies for
anti-Ukrainian actions and language. Michael Malet summarises, for the
Makhnovists *"Ukrainian culture was welcome, but political nationalism
was highly suspect."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 143]

Given anarchist support for federal organisation from below upwards,
working-class self-determination and autonomy, plus a healthy respect
for local culture, it is easy to see why some historians have fostered a
nationalist perspective onto the Makhnovists where none existed. This
means that when they agitated with the slogan *"All to whom freedom and
independence are dear should stay in the Ukraine and fight the
Denikinists,"* it should be noted that *"[n]owhere .. . . nationalism
openly advocated, and the line of argument put forward can more easily
be interpreted as libertarian and, above all, anti-White."* [Malet,
**Op. Cit.**, p. 146]

In 1928, Makhno wrote a rebuttal to a Soviet historian's claim that
Makhno became a Ukrainian Nationalist during the 1920-21 period. He
*"totally dismissed the charges"* and argued that the historian
*"distorted anarchism's espousal of local autonomy so as to create
trumped-up charges of nationalism."* As Sysyn argues, while Makhno
*"never became a nationalist, he did to a degree become a Ukrainian
anarchist."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 292 and p. 303]

Thus while neither Makhno nor the movement were nationalists, they were
not blind to national and cultural oppression. They considered
nationalism as too narrow a goal to satisfy the **social** aspirations
of the working classes. As Makhno argued in exile, the Ukrainian toilers
had *"asserted their rights to use their own language and their
entitlement to their own culture, which had been regarded before the
revolution as anathema. They also asserted their right to conform in
their lives to their own way of life and specific customs."* However,
*"[i]n the aim of building an independent Ukrainian State, certain
statist gentlemen would dearly love to arrogate to themselves all
natural manifestations of Ukrainian reality."* Yet the *"healthy
instincts of the Ukrainian toilers and their baleful life under the
Bolshevik yoke has not made them oblivious of the State danger in
general"* and so they *"shun the chauvinist trend and do not mix it up
with their social aspirations, rather seeking their own road to
emancipation."* [**The Struggle Against the State and Other Essays**,
pp. 24-5]

In summary, the Makhnovists were opposed to nationalism but supported
culture diversity and self-determination within a free federation of
toilers communes and councils. They did not limit their aims to national
liberation, but rather sought the self-liberation of the working classes
from every oppression -- foreign or domestic, economic or political,
cultural or social.

12 Did the Makhnovists support the Whites?
------------------------------------------

No, they did not. However, black propaganda by the Bolsheviks stated
they did. Victor Serge wrote about the *"strenuous calumnies put out by
the Communist Party"* against him *"which went so far as to accuse him
of signing pacts with the Whites at the very moment when he was engaged
in a life-and-death struggle against them."* [**Memoirs of a
Revolutionary**, p. 122]

According to Arshinov, *"Soviet newspapers spread the false news of an
alliance between Makhno and Wrangel"* and in the summer of 1920, a
representative of the Kharkov government *"declared at the Plenary
Session of the Ekaterinoslav Soviet, that Soviet authorities had written
proof of the alliance between Makhno and Wrangel. This was obviously an
intentional lie."* Wrangel, perhaps believing these lies had some basis,
sent a messenger to Makhno in July, 1920. *"Wrangel's messenger was
immediately executed"* and the *"entire incident was reported in the
Makhnovist press. All this was perfectly clear to the Bolsheviks. They
nevertheless continued to trumpet the alliance between Makhno and
Wrangel. It was only after a military-political agreement had been
concluded between the Makhnovists and the Soviet power that the Soviet
Commissariat of War announced that there had never been an alliance
between Makhno and Wrangel, that earlier Soviet assertions to this
effect were an error."* [**Op. Cit.**, pp. 173-5]

Needless to say, while the Bolsheviks spread the rumour to discredit
Makhno, the Whites spread it to win the confidence of the peasants. Thus
when Trotsky stated that Wrangel had *"united with the Ukrainian
partisan Makhno,"* he was aiding the efforts of Wrangel to learn from
previous White mistakes and build some kind of popular base. [quoted by
Palij, **Op. Cit.**, p. 220] By October, Trotsky had retracted this
statement:

> *"Wrangel really tried to come into direct contact with Makhno's men
> and dispatched to Makhno's headquarters two representatives for
> negotiations . . . [However] Makhno's men not only did not enter into
> negotiations with the representatives of Wrangel, but publicly hanged
> them as soon as they arrived at the headquarters."* [quoted by Palij,
> **Ibid.**]

Trotsky, of course, still tried to blacken the Makhnovists. In the same
article he argued that *"[u]ndoubtedly Makhno actually co-operated with
Wrangel, and also with the Polish **szlachta**, as he fought with them
against the Red Army. However, there was no formal alliance between
them. All the documents mentioning a formal alliance were fabricated by
Wrangel . . . All this fabrication was made to deceive the protectors of
Makhno, the French, and other imperialists."* [quoted by Palij, **Op.
Cit.**, p. 225]

It is hard to know where to start in this amazing piece of political
story-telling. As we discuss in more detail in [section
13](append46.html#app13), the Makhnovists were fighting the Red Army
from January to September 1920 because the Bolsheviks had engineered
their outlawing! As historian David Footman points out, the attempt by
the Bolsheviks to transfer Makhno to Polish front was done for political
reasons:

> *"it is admitted on the Soviet side that this order was primarily
> 'dictated by the necessity' of liquidating **Makhnovshchina** as an
> independent movement. Only when he was far removed from his home
> country would it be possible to counteract his influence"* [**Op.
> Cit.**, p. 291]

Indeed, it could be argued that by attacking Makhno in January helped
the Whites to regroup under Wrangel and return later in the year.
Equally, it seems like a bad joke for Trotsky to blame the victim of
Bolshevik intrigues for defending themselves. And the idea that Makhno
had *"protectors"* in any imperialist nation is a joke, which deserves
only laughter as a response!

It should be noted that it is *"agreed that the initiative for joint
action against Wrangel came from the Makhnovites."* This was ignored by
the Bolsheviks until after *"Wrangel started his big offensive"* in
September 1920 [Footman, **Op. Cit.**, p. 294 and p. 295]

So while the Bolsheviks claimed that the Makhnovists had made a pact
with General Wrangel, the facts are that Makhnovists fought the Whites
with all their energy. Indeed, they considered the Whites so great a
threat to the revolution they even agreed to pursue a pact with the
Bolsheviks, who had betrayed them twice already and had subjected both
them and the peasantry to repression. As such, it could be argued that
the Bolsheviks were the only counter-revolutionaries the Makhnovists can
be accurately accused of collaborating with.

Every historian who has studied the movement has refuted claims that the
Makhnovist movement made any alliance with the counter-revolutionary
White forces. For example, Michael Palij notes that Denikin *"was the
main enemy that Makhno fought, stubbornly and uncompromising, from the
end of 1918 to the end of 1919. Its social and anti-Ukrainian policies
greatly antagonised all segments of Ukrainian society. The result of
this was an increased resistance to the Volunteer Army and its regime
and a substantial strengthening of the Makhno movement."* He also notes
that after several months of *"hard fighting"* Denikin's troops *"came
to regard Makhno's army as their most formidable enemy."* Makhno's
conflict with Wrangel was equally as fierce and *"[a]lthough Makhno had
fought both the Bolsheviks and Wrangel, his contribution to the final
defeat of the latter was essential, as is proved by the efforts of both
sides to have him as an ally."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 177, p. 202 and p.
228] According to Footman, Makhno *"remained to the end the implacable
enemy of the Whites."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 295] Malet just states the
obvious: *"The Makhnovists were totally opposed to the Whites."* [**Op.
Cit.**, p. 140]

We will leave the last word to the considered judgement of the White
General Denikin who, in exile, stated that the Makhno movement was *"the
most antagonistic to the idea of the White movement."* [quoted by Malet,
**Op. Cit.**, p. 140]

In summary, the Makhnovists fought the White counter-revolution with all
their might, playing a key role in the struggle and defeat of both
Denikin and Wrangel. Anyone who claims that they worked with the Whites
is either ignorant or a liar.

13 What was the relationship of the Bolsheviks to the movement?
---------------------------------------------------------------

The Makhnovists worked with the Bolsheviks in three periods. The first
(and longest) was against Denikin after the Red Army had entered the
Ukraine after the withdrawal of the Austro-Germans. The second was an
informal agreement for a short period after Denikin had been defeated.
The third was a formal political and military agreement between October
and November 1920 in the struggle against Wrangel. Each period of
co-operation ended with Bolshevik betrayal and conflict between the two
forces.

As such, the relationship of the Bolsheviks to the Makhnovists was one
of, at best, hostile co-operation against a common enemy. Usually, it
was one of conflict. This was due, fundamentally, to two different
concepts of social revolution. While the Makhnovists, as anarchists,
believed in working-class self-management and autonomy, the Bolsheviks
believed that only a centralised state structure (headed by themselves)
could ensure the success of the revolution. By equating working-class
power with Bolshevik party government (and from 1919 onwards, with the
dictatorship of the Bolshevik party), they could not help viewing the
Makhnovist movement as a threat to their power (see [section
14](append46.html#app14) for a discussion of the political differences
and the evolving nature of the Bolshevik's conception of party rule).

Such a perspective ensured that they could only co-operate during
periods when the White threat seemed most dangerous. As soon as the
threat was defeated or they felt strong enough, the Bolsheviks turned on
their former allies instantly. This section discusses each of the
Bolshevik betrayals and the subsequent conflicts. As such, it is
naturally broken up into three parts, reflecting each of the betrayals
and their aftermath.

Michael Malet sums up the usual Bolshevik-Makhnovist relationship by
arguing that it *"will be apparent that the aim of the Soviet government
from the spring of 1919 onwards was to destroy the Makhnovists as an
independent force, preferably killing Makhno himself in the process . .
. Given the disastrous nature of Bolshevik land policy . . . this was
not only unsurprisingly, it was inevitable."* He also adds that the
*"fact that Makhno had a socio-political philosophy to back up his
arguments only made the Bolsheviks more determined to break his hold
over the south-east Ukraine, as soon as they realised that Nestor would
not surrender that hold voluntarily."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 128 and p. 129]

The first betrayal occurred in June 1919. The Makhnovists had been
integrated with the Red Army in late January 1919, retaining their
internal organisation (including the election of commanders) and their
black flags. With the Red Army they fought against Denikin's Volunteer
Army. Before the arrival of Red forces in their region and the
subsequent pact, the Makhnovists had organised a successful regional
insurgent, peasant and worker congress which had agreed to call a second
for February 12th. This second congress set up a Revolutionary Military
Soviet to implement the decisions of this and following congresses. This
congress (see [section 7](append46.html#app7)) passed an anti-Bolshevik
resolution, which urged *"the peasants and workers to watch vigilantly
the actions of the Bolshevik regime that cause a real danger to the
worker-peasant revolution."* Such actions included the monopolisation of
the revolution, centralising power and overriding local soviets,
repressing anarchists and Left Socialist Revolutionaries and *"stifling
any manifestation of revolutionary expression."* [quoted by Palij, **Op.
Cit.**, p. 154]

This change from the recent welcome was simply the behaviour of the
Bolsheviks since their arrival. The (unelected) Ukrainian Bolshevik
government had tried to apply the same tactics as its Russian
equivalent, particularly as regards the peasants. In addition, the
Bolshevik land policy (as indicated in [section 8](append46.html#app8))
was a complete disaster, alien to the ideas and needs of the peasants
and, combined with grain requisitioning, alienating them.

The third congress was held on the 10th of April. By this time,
Communist agricultural policy and terrorism had alienated all the
peasantry, who *"rich and poor alike"* were *"united in their
opposition"* to the Bolsheviks. [Footman, **Op. Cit.**, p. 269] Indeed,
the *"poorer the areas, the more dissatisfied were the peasants with the
Bolshevik decrees."* [Palij, **Op. Cit.**, p. 156] As we indicated in
[section 7](append46.html#app7), the third congress was informed that it
was *"counter-revolutionary"* and banned by the Bolshevik commander
Dybenko, provoking a famous reply which stressed the right of a
revolutionary people to apply the gains of that revolution when they see
fit. It is worth re-quoting the relevant section:

> *"Can there exist laws made by a few people who call themselves
> revolutionaries which permit them to outlaw a whole people who are
> more revolutionary than they are themselves? . . .*
>
> "Is it permissible, is it admissible, that they should come to the
> country to establish laws of violence, to subjugate a people who have
> just overthrown all lawmakers and all laws?
>
> "Does there exist a law according to which a revolutionary has the
> right to apply the most severe penalties to a revolutionary mass, of
> which he calls himself the defender, simply because this mass has
> taken the good things which the revolution promised them, freedom and
> equality, without his permission?
>
> "Should the mass of revolutionary people perhaps be silent when such a
> revolutionary takes away the freedom which they have just conquered?
>
> "Do the laws of the revolution order the shooting of a delegate
> because he believes he ought to carry out the mandate given him by the
> revolutionary mass which elected him?
>
> "Whose interests should the revolutionary defend; those of the Party
> or those of the people who set the revolution in motion with their
> blood?" [quoted by Arshinov, **Op. Cit.**, p. 103]

After the 3rd congress, the Bolsheviks started to turn against Makhno:

> *"It was now that favourable mention of Makhno ceased to appear in the
> Soviet Press; an increasingly critical note became apparent. Supplies
> failed to get through to Makhnovite units and areas."* [Footman, **Op.

Lenin himself advised local Bolshevik leaders on Makhno, stating in
early May that *"temporarily, while Rostov is not yet captured, it is
necessary to be diplomatic."* [quoted by Arthur E. Adams, **Bolsheviks
in the Ukraine**, pp. 352-3] Thus, as long as the Bolsheviks needed
cannon fodder, Makhno was to be tolerated. Things changed when Trotsky
arrived. On May 17th he promised a *"radical and merciless liquidation
of partisanshchina [the partisan movement], independence, hooliganism,
and leftism."* [quoted by Adams, **Op. Cit.**, p. 360] According to one
historian, Trotsky *"favoured a thorough-going annihilation of the
partisan's ideological leaders as well as men like Hryhoriyov who
wielded political power."* [Adams, **Op. Cit.**, p. 360] Unsurprisingly,
given Trotsky's stated mission, Bolshevik hostility towards the
Makhnovists became more than mere words. It took the form of both direct
and indirect aggression. *"In the latter part of May,"* states Footman,
*"the **Cheka** sent over two agents to assassinate Makhno."* Around the
same time, the Red *"hold-back of supplies for the Insurgents developed
into a blockade of the area. Makhnovite units at the front ran short of
ammunition."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 271 and p. 272] This, obviously, had a
negative impact the Makhnovists' ability to fight the Whites.

Due to the gravity of the military and political situations both at and
behind the front, the Makhnovist Revolutionary Military Soviet decided
to call an extraordinary congress of peasants, workers, insurgents and
Red soldiers. This congress was to determine the immediate tasks and the
practical measures to be taken by the workers to remedy the mortal
danger represented by the Whites. On May 31st, a call was sent out which
stated, in part, *"that only the working masses themselves can find a
solution [to the current problem], and not individuals or parties."* The
congress would be based as follows: *"elections of delegates of peasants
and workers will take place at general assemblies of villages, towns,
factories and workshops."* [quoted by Arshinov, **Op. Cit.**, p. 121]

The Bolshevik reply came quickly, with Trotsky issuing his infamous
Order no. 1824 on June 4th:

> *"This Congress is directed squarely against the Soviet Power in the
> Ukraine and against the organisation of the southern front, where
> Makhno's brigade is stationed. This congress can have no other result
> then to excite some new disgraceful revolt like that of Grigor'ev, and
> to open the front to the Whites, before whom Makhno's brigade can only
> retreat incessantly on account of the incompetence, criminal designs
> and treason of its commanders.*
>
> "1. By the present order this congress is forbidden, and will in no
> circumstances be allowed to take place.
>
> "2. All the peasant and working class population shall be warned.
> orally and in writing, that participation in the said congress will be
> considered an act of high treason against the Soviet Republic and the
> Soviet front.
>
> "3. All delegates to the said Congress shall be arrested immediately
> and bought before the Revolutionary Military Tribunal of the 14th,
> formerly 2nd, Army of the Ukraine.
>
> "4. The persons spreading the call of Makhno and the Hulyai Pole
> Executive Committee to the Congress shall likewise be arrested.
>
> "5. The present order shall have the force of law as soon as it is

> authority, and to commanders and commissars of military units."
> [quoted by Arshinov, **Op. Cit.**, pp. 122-3]

Arshinov argues that this *"document is truly classic"* and *"[w]hoever
studies the Russian revolution should learn it by heart."* He compares
Trotsky's order to the reply the Makhnovists had sent to the Bolsheviks'
attempt to ban the third congress. Clearly, Order No. 1824 shows that
laws did exist *"made by a a few people who call themselves
revolutionaries which permit them to outlaw a whole people who are more
revolutionary than they are themselves"*! Equally, the order shows that
*"a revolutionary has the right to apply the most severe penalties to a
revolutionary mass . . . simply because this mass has taken the good
things which the revolution has promised them, freedom and equality,
without his permission"*! Little wonder Arshinov states that this order
meant that the *"entire peasant and labouring population are declared
guilty of high treason if they dare to participate in their own free
congress."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 123]

According to Voline, in Alexandrovsk *"all workers meetings planned for
the purpose of discussing the call of the Council and the agenda of the
Congress were forbidden under pain of death. Those which were organised
in ignorance of the order were dispersed by armed force. In other cities
and towns, the Bolsheviks acted in the same way. As for the peasants in
the villages, they were treated with still less ceremony; in many places
militants and even peasants 'suspected of acting in favour of the
insurgents and the Congress' were seized and executed after a semblance
of a trial. Many peasants carrying the call were arrested, 'tried' and
shot, before they could even find out about Order No. 1824."* [**Op.
Cit.**, pp. 599-600]

As Arshinov summarises:

> *"This entire document represents such a crying usurpation of the
> rights of the workers that it is pointless to comment further on it."*
> [**Op. Cit.**, p. 124]

Trotsky continued his usurpation of the rights of the workers in a later
order on the congress. In this, Trotsky called this openly announced
workers, peasant and insurgent congress a *"conspiracy against Soviet
power"* and a *"congress of Anarchist-kulaks delegates for struggle
against the Red Army and the Soviet power"* (which explains why the
congress organisers had asked that hotbed of kulakism, the Red Army
troops, to send delegates!). Trotsky indicated the fate of those workers
and peasants who dared participate in their own revolution: *"There can
be only one penalty for these individuals: shooting."* [**How the
Revolution Armed**, vol. II, p. 293]

Trotsky also ordered the arrest of Makhno, who escaped but who ordered
his troops to remain under Bolshevik command to ensure that the front
against Denikin was maintained. However, five members of his staff were
shot for having distributed literature concerning the banned fourth
congress. This order was the first step in the Bolshevik attempt to
*"liquidate the Makhnovist movement."* This campaign saw Bolshevik
regiments invade the insurgent area, shooting militants on the spot and
destroying the free communes and other Makhnovist organisations.
[Arshinov, **Op. Cit.**, p. 121] It should be noted that during the
Spanish Revolution, the Stalinists acted in the same way, attacking
rural collectives while the anarchist troops fought against Franco at
the front.

Thus the participating event for the break between the Makhnovists and
Bolsheviks was Trotsky's banning of the fourth regional congress.
However, this was preceded by an intense press campaign against the
Makhnovists as well as holding back of essential supplies from the
frontline troops. Clearly the Bolsheviks considered that the soviet
system was threatened if soviet conferences were called and that the
"dictatorship of the proletariat" was undermined if the proletariat took
part in the revolutionary process!

With the Makhnovist front weakened, they could not hold against
Denikin's attacks, particularly when Red Army troops retreated on their
flank. Thus, the front which the Makhnovists themselves had formed and
held for more than six months was finally broken. [Arshinov, **Op.
Cit.**, p. 124] The Red Army was split into three and the Whites entered
the Ukraine, which the Bolsheviks promptly abandoned to its fate. The
Makhnovists, drawing stray Red Army and other forces to it, continued to
fight the Whites, ultimately inflicting a decisive defeat on them at
Peregonovka, subsequently destroying their supply lines and ensuring
Denikin's defeat (see [section 4](append46.html#app4)).

The Red Army re-entered the Ukraine at the end of 1919. Bolshevik plans
with regard to the Makhnovists had already been decided in a secret
order written by Trotsky on December 11th. Red Army troops had to *"be
protected against infection by guerrilla-ism and Makhnovism"* by various
means, including *"extensive agitation"* which used *"examples from the
past to show the treacherous role played by the Makhnovites."* A
*"considerable number of agents"* would be sent *"ahead"* of the main
forces to *"join the guerrilla detachments"* and would agitate against
*"guerrilla-ism."* Once partisan forces meet with Red Army troops, the
former *"ceases to be a military unit after it has appeared on our side
of the line . . . From that moment it becomes merely material for
processing, and for that purpose is to be sent to our rear."* To
*"secure complete subordination of the detachments,"* the Red forces
*"must make use of the agents previously set to these detachments."* The
aim, simply put, was to ensure that the partisans became *"fully
subordinate to our command."* If the partisans who had been fighting for
revolution and against the Whites opposed becoming *"material for
processing"* (i.e cannon fodder), *"refuses to submit to orders,
displays unruliness and self-will,"* then it *"must be subjected to
ruthless punishment."* Recognising the organic links the partisans had
with the peasants, Trotsky argues that *"in the Ukraine, guerrilla
detachments appear and disappear with ease, dissolving themselves into
the mass of the armed peasant population"* and so *"a fundamental
condition for the success against guerrilla-ism is **unconditional
disarmament of the rural population, without exception.**"* [Trotsky,
**How the Revolution Armed**, vol. II, pp. 440-2] As events would show,
the Bolsheviks implemented Trotsky's order to the letter.

On December 24th, Makhno's troops met with the Bolshevik 14th army and
its commander *"admitted Makhno's service in defeating Denikin."*
However, while *"the Bolsheviks fraternised with the Makhno troops . . .
they distrusted Makhno, fearing the popularity he had gained as a result
of his successful fighting against Denikin."* The Bolsheviks had *"no
intention of tolerating Makhno's independent policy, but hoped first to
destroy his army by removing it from its own base. With this in mind, on
January 8th, 1920, the Revolutionary Military Council of the Fourteenth
Army ordered Makhno to move to the Polish Front . . . The author of the
order realised that there was no real war between the Poles and the
Bolsheviks at the time and he also knew that Makhno would not abandon
his region. .. . . Uborevich [the author] explained that 'an appropriate
reaction by Makhno to this order would give us the chance to have
accurate grounds for our next steps' . . . [He] concluded: 'The order is
a certain political manoeuvre and, at the very least, we expect positive
results from Makhno's realisation of this.'"* [Palij, **Op. Cit.**, p.
209 and p. 210] As can be seen, these actions fit perfectly with
Trotsky's secret order and with Bolshevik desire for a monopoly of power
for itself (see [next section](append46.html#app14)).

As expected, the Makhnovists refused to leave their territory. They
realised the political motivations behind the order. As Arshinov notes,
*"[s]ending the insurrectionary army to the Polish front meant removing
from the Ukraine the main nerve centre of the revolutionary
insurrection. This was precisely what the Bolsheviks wanted: they would
then be absolute masters of the rebellious region, and the Makhnovists
were perfectly aware of this."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 163] As well as
political objections, the Makhnovists listed practical reasons for not
going. Firstly, *"the Insurrectionary Army was subordinate neither to
the 14th Corps nor to any other unit of the Red Army. The Red commander
had no authority to give orders to the Insurrectionary Army."* Secondly,
*"it was materially impossible to carry it out, since half the men, as
well as nearly all the commanders and staff, and Makhno himself, were
sick [with typhus]."* Thirdly, *"the fighting qualities and
revolutionary usefulness of the Insurrectionary Army were certainly much
greater on their own ground."* [Voline, **Op. Cit.**, pp. 650-1]

The Bolsheviks refused to discuss the issue and on the 14th of January,
they declared the Makhnovists outlawed. They then *"made a great effort
to destroy"* Makhno. [Palij, **Op. Cit.**, p. 210] In summary, the
Bolsheviks **started** the conflict in order to eliminate opposition to
their power. This led to nine months of bitter fighting between the Red
Army and the Makhnovists. To prevent fraternisation, the Bolsheviks did
not use local troops and instead imported Latvian, Estonian and Chinese
troops. They also used other *"new tactics,"* and *"attacked not only
Makhno's partisans, but also the villages and towns in which the
population was sympathetic toward Makhno. They shot ordinary soldiers as
well as their commanders, destroying their houses, confiscating their
properties and persecuting their families. Moreover the Bolsheviks
conducted mass arrests of innocent peasants who were suspected of
collaborating in some way with the partisans. It is impossible to
determine the casualties involved."* They also set up *"Committees of
the Poor"* as part of the Bolshevik administrative apparatus, which
acted as *"informers helping the Bolshevik secret police in its
persecution of the partisans, their families and supporters, even to the
extent of hunting down and executing wounded partisans."* [Palij, **Op.
Cit.**, pp. 212-3]

This conflict undoubtedly gave time for the Whites to reorganise
themselves and encouraged the Poles to invade the Ukraine, so prolonging
the Civil War. The Makhnovists were threatened by both the Bolsheviks
**and** Wrangel. By mid-1920, Wrangel appeared to be gaining the upper
hand and the Makhnovists *"could not remain indifferent to Wrangel's
advance . . . Everything done to destroy him would in the last analysis
benefit the revolution."* This lead the Makhnovists to consider allying
with the Bolsheviks as *"the difference between the Communists and
Wrangel was that the Communists had the support of the masses with faith
in the revolution. It is true that these masses were cynically misled by
the Communists, who exploited the revolutionary enthusiasm of the
workers in the interests of Bolshevik power."* With this in mind, the
Makhnovists agreed at a mass assembly to make an alliance with the
Bolsheviks against Wrangel as this would eliminate the White threat and
end the civil war. [Arshinov, **Op. Cit.**, p. 176]

The Bolsheviks ignored the Makhnovist offer using mid-September, when
*"Wrangel's success caused the Bolsheviks leaders to reconsider."*
[Palij, **Op. Cit.**, p. 223] Sometime between the 10th and 15th of
October the final agreement was signed:

> *"Part I -- Political Agreement.*
>
> "1. Immediate release of all Makhnovists and anarchists imprisoned or
> in exile in the territories of the Soviet Republic; cessation of all
> persecutions of Makhnovists or anarchists, except those who carry on

> ." [quoted by Arshinov, **Op. Cit.**, p. 178]

This agreement was agreed by both sides, although the Bolsheviks
immediately broke it by publishing the military agreement first,
followed by the political agreement a week later, so obscuring the real
meaning of the pact. As it stands, the political clause simply gave
anarchists and Makhnovists the rights they should have already had,
according to the constitution of the Soviet state. This shows how far
the Bolsheviks had applied that constitution.

The agreement is highly significant as in itself it disproves many of
the Bolsheviks slanders about the Makhnovists and it proves the
suppression of the anarchist press to have been on political grounds.

However, the Makhnovists desired to add a fourth clause to the Political
Agreement:

> *"Since one of the essential principles of the Makhnovist movement is
> the struggle for the self-management of the workers, the
> Insurrectionary Army (Makhnovist) believes it should insist on the
> following fourth point of the political agreement: in the region where
> the Makhnovist Army is operating, the population of workers and
> peasants will create its own institutions of economic and political
> self-management; these institutions will be autonomous and joined in
> federation, by means of agreement, with the government organs of the
> Soviet Republic,"* [quoted by Arshinov, **Op. Cit.**, pp. 179-80]

Unsurprisingly, the Bolsheviks refused to ratify this clause. As one
Bolshevik historian pointed out, the *"fourth point was fundamental to
both sides, it meant the system of free Soviets, which was in total
opposition to the idea of the dictatorship of the proletariat."* [quoted
by Malet, **Op. Cit.**, p. 108] As we discuss in the [next
section](append46.html#app14), the Bolsheviks had equated the
*"dictatorship of the proletariat"* with the dictatorship of their party
and so working-class self-management could not be allowed. It should be
noted that this fourth clause was the cause of Lenin and Trotsky's
toying with the idea of allowing the Makhnovists south-eastern Ukraine
as an anarchist experiment (as mentioned by both Victor Serge and
Trotsky in later years).

Once Wrangel had been defeated by Makhnovist and Red Army units, the
Bolsheviks turned on the movement. Makhno had *"assumed that the coming
conflict with the Bolsheviks could be limited to the realm of ideas,
feeling that the strong revolutionary ideas and feelings of the
peasants, together with their distrust of the foreign invaders, were the
best guarantees for the movement's territory. Moreover, Makhno believed
that the Bolsheviks would not attack his movement immediately. A respite
of some three months would have allowed him to consolidate his power
[sic!] and to win over much of the Bolshevik rank and file."* [Palij,
**Op. Cit.**, p. 231] From the wording of the second clause of the
military agreement (namely, to refuse Red Army deserters or units), it
is clear that the Bolsheviks were aware of the appeal of Makhnovist
politics on the Red Army soldiers. As soon as Wrangel was defeated, the
Red Army attacked. Makhnovist commanders were invited to meetings,
arrested and then shot. The Red Army surrounded Makhnovist units and
attacked them. At the same time, anarchists were arrested all across the
Ukraine. Hulyai Pole itself was attacked (Makhno, despite overwhelming
odds, broke out). [Malet, **Op. Cit.**, pp. 71-2]

In the words of Makhno:

> *"In this difficult and responsible revolutionary position the Makhno
> movement made one great mistake: alliance with the Bolsheviks against
> a common enemy, Wrangel and the Entente. In the period of this
> alliance that was morally right and of practical value for the
> revolution, the Makhno movement mistook Bolshevik revolutionism and
> failed to secure itself in advance against betrayal. The Bolsheviks
> and their experts treacherously circumvented it."* [quoted by Palij,
> **Op. Cit.**, p. 234]

While the Bolsheviks continuously proclaimed the final defeat of the
Makhnovists, they held out for nearly a year before being forced to
leave the Ukraine in August 1921. Indeed, by the end of 1920 his troops
number ten to fifteen thousand men and the *"growing strength of the
Makhno army and its successes caused serious concern in the Bolshevik
regime."* More Red troops were deployed, *"stationing whole regiments,
primarily cavalry, in the occupied villages to terrorise the peasants
and prevent them from supporting Makhno. . . Cheka punitive units were
constantly trailing the partisans, executing Makhno's sympathisers and
the partisans' families."* [Palij, **Op. Cit.**, p. 237 and p. 238]
Combined with this state terrorism, economic conditions in the villages
got worse. The countryside was exhausted and 1921 was a famine year.
With his rural base itself barely surviving, the Makhnovists could not
survive long.

It should be noted that during the periods after the Bolsheviks had
turned on the Makhnovists, the latter appealed to rank-and-file Red Army
troops not to attack them. As one of their leaflets put it: *"Down with
fratricidal war among the working people!"* They urged the Red Army
troops (with some success) to rebel against the commissars and appointed
officers and join with the Makhnovists, who would *"greet [them] as our
own brothers and together we will create a free and just life for
workers and peasants and will struggle against all tyrants and
oppressors of the working people."* [contained in Arshinov, **Op.
Cit.**, p. 276 and p. 283]

Even after the defeat of the Makhnovists, the Bolsheviks did not stop
their campaign of lies. For example, Trotsky reported to the Ninth
Congress of Soviets on December 26th, 1921, that the Makhnovists were
*"in Romania,"* where Makhno had *"received a friendly welcome"* and was
*"liv[ing] comfortably in Bucharest."* The Makhnovists had picked
Romania because it was, like Poland, *"a country where they . . . felt
secure"* due to the way they treated *"Russian counter-revolutionary
bands."* [**How the Revolution Armed**, vol. IV, p. 404] In reality, the
*"Romanian authorities put Makhno, his wife, and his followers in an
internment camp."* The Bolsheviks were not unaware of this, as they
*"sent a series of sharp diplomatic notes demanding Makhno's
extradiction."* They expelled Makhno and his wife to Poland on April 11,
1922. The Poles also interned them and, again, the Bolsheviks demanded
Makhno's extradition *"on the ground that he was a criminal and not
entitled to political asylum."* [Palij, **Op. Cit.**, p. 242] Trotsky's
lies come as no surprise, given his and his party's track record on
slandering anarchists.

As can be seen, the relationship of the Makhnovists to the Bolsheviks
was one of constant betrayal of the former by the latter. Moreover, the
Bolsheviks took every opportunity to slander the Makhnovists, with
Trotsky going so far as to report Makhno was living well while he was
rotting in a capitalist prison. This is to be expected, as the aims of
the two groups were at such odds. As we discuss in the [next
section](append46.html#app14), while the Makhnovists did whatever they
could to encourage working-class self-management and freedom, the
Bolsheviks had evolved from advocating the government of their party as
the expression of "the dictatorship of the proletariat" to stating that
only the dictatorship of their party could ensure the success of a
social revolution and so **was** "the dictatorship of the proletariat."
As the Makhnovist movement shows, if need be, the party would happily
exercise its dictatorship **over** the proletariat (and peasantry) if
that was needed to retain its power.

14 How did the Makhnovists and Bolsheviks differ?
-------------------------------------------------

Like chalk and cheese.

Whereas the Bolsheviks talked about soviet democracy while exercising a
party dictatorship, the Makhnovists not only talked about *"free
soviets,"* they also encouraged them with all their ability. Similarly,
while Lenin stated that free speech was *"a bourgeois notion"* and that
there could be *"no free speech in a revolutionary period,"* the
Makhnovists proclaimed free speech for working people. [Lenin quoted by
Goldman, **My Disillusionment in Russia**, p. 33] While the Bolsheviks
ended up arguing for the necessity of party dictatorship during a
revolution, the Makhnovists introduced free soviets and organised
peasant, worker and insurgent congresses to conduct the revolution.

We have discussed the Makhnovist ideas in both theory and practice in
sections [5](append46.html#app5), [6](append46.html#app6) and
[7](append46.html#app7). In spite of the chaos and difficulties imposed
upon the movement by having to fight the counter-revolution, the
Makhnovists applied their ideals constantly. The Makhnovists were a mass
movement and its constructive efforts showed that there was an
alternative route the Russian revolution could have followed other than
the authoritarian dictatorship that Leninists, then and now, claimed was
inevitable if the revolution was to be saved.

To see why, we must compare Bolshevik ideology and practice to that of
the Makhnovists in three key areas. Firstly, on how a revolution should
be defended. Secondly, on the role of the soviets and party in the
revolution. Thirdly, on the question of working-class freedom.

Early in 1918, after the signing of the Brest-Litovsk Treaty the
Bolsheviks re-introduced Tsarist officers into the army alongside
bourgeois military discipline. As Maurice Brinton correctly summarises:

> *"Trotsky, appointed Commissar of Military Affairs after
> Brest-Litovsk, had rapidly been reorganising the Red Army. The death
> penalty for disobedience under fire had been restored. So, more
> gradually, had saluting, special forms of address, separate living
> quarters and other privileges for officers. Democratic forms of
> organisation, including the election of officers, had been quickly
> dispensed with."* [**The Bolsheviks and Workers' Control**, p. 37]

Officers were appointed rather then elected. They argued this had to be
done to win the war. The *"principle of election,"* stated Trotsky, *"is
politically purposeless and technically inexpedient and has been, in
practice, abolished by decree."* Thus the election of officers and the
creation of soldiers' committees was abolished from the top, replaced by
appointed officers. Trotsky's rationale for this was simply that
*"political power is in the hands of the same working class from whose
ranks the Army is recruited."* In other words, the Bolshevik Party held
power as power was actually held by it, **not** the working class.
Trotsky tried to answer the obvious objection:

> *"Once we have established the Soviet regime, that is a system under
> which the government is headed by persons who have been directly
> elected by the Soviets of Workers', Peasants' and Soldiers' Deputies,
> there can be no antagonism between the government and the mass of the
> workers, just as there is no antagonism between the administration of
> the union and the general assembly of its members, and, therefore,
> there cannot be any grounds for fearing the **appointment** of members
> of the commanding staff by the organs of the Soviet Power."* [**Work,
> Discipline, Order**]

He repeated this argument in his 1919 diatribe against the Makhnovists:

> *"The Makhnovites shout raucously: 'Down with appointed commanders!'
> This they do only so as to delude the ignorant element among their own
> soldiers. One can speak of 'appointed' persons only under the
> bourgeois order, when Tsarist officials or bourgeois ministers
> appointed at their own discretion commanders who kept the soldier
> masses subject to the bourgeois classes. Today there is no authority
> in Russia but that which is elected by the whole working class and
> working peasantry. It follows that commanders appointed by the central
> Soviet Government are installed in their positions by the will of the
> working millions. But the Makhnovite commanders reflect the interests
> of a minute group of Anarchists who rely on the kulaks and the
> ignorant."* [**The Makhno Movement**]

Of course, most workers are well aware that the administration of a
trade union usually works against them during periods of struggle.
Indeed, so are most Trotskyists as they often denounce the betrayals by
that administration. Thus Trotsky's own analogy indicates the fallacy of
his argument. Equally, it was not *"the will of the working millions"*
which appointed anyone, it was a handful of leaders of the Bolshevik
party (which had manipulated the soviets to remain in power). Needless
to say, this was a vast change from Lenin's comments in **State and
Revolution** opposing appointment and calling for election of **all**
officials!

Moreover, the explanation that *"the ignorant"* were to blame for
Makhnovist opposition to appointed officers had a long legacy with
Trotsky. In April 1918, when justifying Bolshevik introduction of
appointed officers, he had argued that the *"Soviet government is the
same as the committee of a trade union. It is elected by the workers and
peasants and you can at the All-Russian Congress of Soviets, at any
moment you like, dismiss that government and appoint another. But once
you have appointed it, you must give it the right to choose the
technical specialists."* He stressed that this applied *"in military
affairs, in particular."* Using the trade union analogy, he argued that
the workers had *"entrusted us [the Bolshevik leaders] with the
direction of the union"* and this meant that the Bolshevik leaders, not
the workers, should decide things as *"we are better able to judge in
the matter"* than them! The workers role was stated clearly: *"if our
way of conducting the business is bad, then throw us out and elect
another committee!"* [**Leon Trotsky Speaks**, p. 113] In other words,
like any bureaucrat, for Trotsky working-class participation in the
affairs of the revolution was seen as irrelevant: the masses had voted
and their role was now that of obeying those who *"are better able to
judge."*

Using an argument the Tsar could have been proud of, Trotsky defended
the elimination of soldier democracy:

> *"How could soldiers who have just entered the army choose the chiefs!
> Have they any vote to go by? They have none. And therefore elections
> are impossible."* [**Ibid.**]

Equally, how could workers and peasants who have just entered political
or economic struggle in 1917 choose the chiefs? Had they any vote to go
by? They had none. And therefore political and workplace elections are
impossible. Unsurprisingly, Trotsky soon ended up applying this logic to
politics as well, defending (like all the leaders of Bolshevism) the
dictatorship of the party **over** working class. How could the
*"ignorant"* workers be expected to elect the best *"chiefs"* never mind
manage their own affairs!

Ironically, in 1936 the Stalinist Communist Party in Spain was to make
very similar arguments about the need for a regular army and army
discipline to win the war. As Aileen O'Carroll in her essay *"Freedom
and Revolution"* argues:

> *"The conventional army structure evolved when feudal kings or
> capitalist governments required the working class to fight its wars
> for them. These had to be authoritarian institutions, because although
> propaganda and jingoism can play a part initially in encouraging
> enlistment, the horrors of war soon expose the futility of
> nationalism. A large part of military organisation is aimed at
> ensuring that soldiers remain fighting for causes they do not
> necessarily believe in. Military discipline attempts to create an
> unthinking, unquestioning body of soldiers, as fearful of their own
> side as of the other."* [**Red & Black Revolution**, no. 1]

In short in both Russia and Spain the Bolsheviks wanted an army that
would obey them regardless of whether the individual soldiers felt they
were doing the correct thing, indeed who would obey through fear of
their officers even when they knew what they were doing was wrong. Such
a body would be essential for enforcing minority rule over the wishes of
the workers. Would a self-managed army be inclined to repress workers'
and peasants' strikes and protests? Of course not.

The Makhnovists show that another kind of revolutionary army was
possible in the Russian Revolution and that the *"ignorant"* masses
could choose their own officers. In other words, the latter-day
justifications of the followers of Bolshevism are wrong when they assert
that the creation of the top-down, hierarchical Red Army was a result of
the *"contradiction between the political consciousness and
circumstantial coercion"* and *"a retreat"* because *"officers were
appointed and not elected,"* it was a conscript army and *"severe
military discipline."* [John Rees, *"In Defence of October"*,
**International Socialism**, no. 52, pp. 3-82, p. 46] As can be seen,
Trotsky did not consider it as a *"retreat"* or caused by
*"circumstances."* Equally, the Makhnovists managed to organise
themselves relatively democratically in the circumstances created by the
same civil war.

As such, the differences between the Makhnovists and the Bolsheviks as
regards the internal organisation of a revolutionary army are clear. The
Bolsheviks applied top-down, bourgeois methods of internal organisation
and discipline. The Makhnovists applied democratic internal organisation
and discipline as far as possible.

From our discussion of the Bolshevik justifications for its system of
appointed officers in the Red Army, it will come as no surprise that as
regards the relationship of the soviets to the revolutionary
organisation (party) the Makhnovists and Bolsheviks were (again) miles
apart. While we discuss this in greater detail in [section
14](append41.html#app14) of the appendix ["What happened during the
Russian Revolution?"](append41.html), we will give a flavour of
Bolshevik ideology on this subject here.

From the start, Lenin identified soviet (or working class) power with
the power of their own party. In October 1917, Lenin was equating party
and class: *"the power of the Bolsheviks -- that is, the power of the
proletariat."* [**Will the Bolsheviks Maintain Power?**, p. 102] After
the October Revolution, the Bolsheviks were clear that the soviets would
not have *"all power."* Rather, the first act of soviet sovereignty was
to alienate it into the hands of a Bolshevik government. In response to
a few leading Bolsheviks who called for a coalition government, the
Bolshevik Central Committee stated that it was *"impossible to refuse a
purely Bolshevik government without treason to the slogan of the power
of the Soviets, since a majority at the Second All-Russian Congress of
Soviets . . . handed power over to this government."* [quoted by Robery
V. Daniels, **A Documentary History of Communism**, vol. 1, pp. 127-8]
How can the *"power of the Soviets"* exist when said soviets immediately
*"handed power"* over to another body? Thus the only *"power"* the
soviets had was simply the *"power"* to determine who actually held
political power.

The question of who held power, the soviets or the party, came into
focus when the soviet elections resulted in non-Bolshevik majorities
being elected. After the initial honeymoon period, soviet elections
started to go badly for the Bolsheviks. Ever since taking power in 1917,
the Bolsheviks had become increasingly alienated from the working class.
The spring and summer of 1918 saw *"great Bolshevik losses in the soviet
elections"* in all provincial city elections that data is available for.
The Mensheviks were the main beneficiaries of these election swings
(Socialist Revolutionaries also gained) The Bolsheviks forcibly
disbanded such soviets. They continually postponed elections and
*"pack[ed] local soviets once they could no longer count on an electoral
majority"* by giving representation to the organisations they dominated
which made workplace elections meaningless. [Samuel Farber, **Before
Stalinism**, pp. 22-4 and p. 33] In Petrograd, such packing swamped the
actual number of workplace delegates, transforming the soviets and
making elections irrelevant. Of the 700-plus deputies to the "new"
soviet, over half were elected by Bolshevik dominated organisations so
ensuring a solid Bolshevik majority even before the factory voting
began.

Thus, the regime remained "soviet" in name only. Faced with a defeat in
the soviets, the Bolsheviks simply abolished them or changed them to
ensure their position. This process, it should be noted, started
**before** the outbreak of Civil War in late May 1918, implying that
Bolshevik authoritarianism cannot be explained as reactions to difficult
objective circumstances.

Unsurprisingly, Bolshevik ideology started to adjust to the position the
party found itself in. As Samuel Farber argues, in the *"period of March
to June 1918, Lenin began to make frequent distinctions **within** the
working class, singling out workers who could still be trusted,
denouncing workers whom he accused of abandoning the working class and
deserting to the side of the bourgeoisie, and complaining about how the
working class had become 'infected with the disease of petty-bourgeois
disintegration.'"* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 25] Combined with the vision of
"working-class" or "soviet" power expressed by the power of his party,
this laid the foundations for what came next. In 1919 Lenin fully and
explicitly argued that the "dictatorship of the proletariat" was, in
fact, the dictatorship of the Bolshevik party:

> *"we are reproached with having established a dictatorship of one
> party . . . we say, 'Yes, it is a dictatorship of one party! This is
> what we stand for and we shall not shift from that position . . . '"*
> [**Collected Works**, vol. 29, p. 535]

This quickly become Bolshevik orthodoxy. Trotsky argued in his infamous
work **Terrorism and Communism** that there was *"no substitution at
all"* when *"the power of the party"* replaces *"the power of the
working class."* Zinoviev argued this point at the Second Congress of
the Communist International. As he put it:

> *"Today, people like Kautsky come along and say that in Russia you do
> not have the dictatorship of the working class but the dictatorship of
> the party. They think this is a reproach against us. Not in the least!
> We have a dictatorship of the working class and that is precisely why
> we also have a dictatorship of the Communist Party. The dictatorship
> of the Communist Party is only a function, an attribute, an expression
> of the dictatorship of the working class . . . [T]he dictatorship of
> the proletariat is at the same time the dictatorship of the Communist
> Party."* [**Proceedings and Documents of the Second Congress, 1920**,
> vol. 1, pp. 151-2]

Neither Lenin nor Trotsky disagreed. By the end of the civil war, Lenin
was arguing that *"the dictatorship of the proletariat cannot be
exercised through an organisation embracing the whole of the class,
because in all capitalist countries (and not only over here, in one of
the most backward) the proletariat is still so divided, so degraded, and
so corrupted in parts . . . that an organisation taking in the whole
proletariat cannot directly exercise proletarian dictatorship. It can be
exercised only by a vanguard . . . the dictatorship of the proletariat
cannot be exercised by a mass proletarian organisation."* [**Collected
Works**, vol. 32, p. 21]

This places the Bolshevik betrayals of the Makhnovists in 1919 and 1920
into **political** context. It also explains the Bolshevik opposition to
the proposed fourth clause of the 1920 political and military agreement
(see [last section](append46.html#app13)). Simply put, at the time (and
long afterwards) the Bolsheviks equated the revolution with their own
power. As such, Makhnovist calls for soviet self-management threatened
the "dictatorship of the proletariat" (i.e. dictatorship of the party)
by encouraging working people to participate in the revolution and
giving the radically false idea that working-class power could be
exercised by working people and their own class organisations.

Lenin, Trotsky and Zinoviev held this position until their deaths.
Trotsky, for example, was arguing in 1923 that *"[i]f there is one
question which basically not only does not require revision but does not
so much as admit the thought of revision, it is the question of the
dictatorship of the Party, and its leadership in all spheres of our
work."* [**Leon Trotsky Speaks**, p. 158] Even after the rise of
Stalinism, he was still arguing for the *"objective necessity"* of the
*"revolutionary dictatorship of a proletarian party"* in 1937. He
stressed that the *"revolutionary party (vanguard) which renounces its
own dictatorship surrenders the masses to the counter-revolution . . .
Abstractly speaking, it would be very well if the party dictatorship
could be replaced by the 'dictatorship' of the whole toiling people
without any party, but this presupposes such a high level of political
development among the masses that it can never be achieved under
capitalist conditions."* [Trotsky, **Writings 1936-37**, pp. 513-4]

This suggests that the later Trotskyist argument that the Bolsheviks
were forced by *"objective factors"* to replace the dictatorship of the
proletariat by that of the party is false. At the time, and afterwards,
the Bolsheviks did not argue in these terms. The end of soviet democracy
was not considered a problem or a retreat for the revolution. The
opposite was the case, with the elimination of democracy being raised to
an ideological truism to be applied everywhere. Equally, the fact that
the Makhnovists did all they could to promote soviet self-management and
actually called regional congresses of workers, peasants and insurgents
suggests that *"objective factors"* simply cannot explain Bolshevik
actions. Simply put, like the Bolshevik betrayals of the Makhnovists,
the Bolshevik elimination of soviet democracy by party dictatorship can
only be fully understood by looking at Bolshevik ideology.

Little wonder the Makhnovists argued as followed:

> *"Since the arrival of the Bolsheviks the dictatorship of their party
> has been established here. As a party of statists, the Bolshevik Party
> everywhere has set up state organs for the purpose of governing the
> revolutionary people. Everything has to be submitted to their
> authority and take place under their vigilant eye. All opposition,
> protest, or even independent initiative has been stifled by their
> Extraordinary Commissions [the secret police, the Cheka]. Furthermore,
> all these institutions are composed of people who are removed from
> labour and from revolution. In other words, what has been created is a
> situation in which the labouring and revolutionary people have fallen
> under the surveillance and rule of people who are alien to the working
> classes, people who are inclined to exercise arbitrariness and
> violence over the workers. Such is the dictatorship of the
> Bolshevik-Communist Party . . .*
> "We again remind the working people that they will liberate themselves
> from oppression, misery and violence only through their own efforts.
> No change in power will help them in this. Only by means of their own
> free worker-peasant organisations can the workers reach the summit of
> the social revolution -- complete freedom and real equality." [quoted
> by Arshinov, **Op. Cit.** pp. 116-7]

Which brings us to the next issue, namely working-class freedom. For
anarchists, the key point of a revolution is to increase working-class
freedom. It means the end of hierarchy and the direct participation in
the revolution by the working classes themselves. As Bakunin put it,
*"revolution is only sincere, honest and real in the hands of the
masses, and that when it is concentrated in those of a few ruling
individuals it inevitably and immediately becomes reaction."* [**Michael
Bakunin: Selected Writings**, p. 237] For this reason, the Makhnovists
(like Bakunin) argued for a revolutionary society based on free
federations of worker and peasant organisations (free soviets).

This means that actions which consolidated rule by a few cannot be
revolutionary, even if the few are made up of the most revolutionary of
the revolutionaries. Thus working class power cannot be equated to the
power of a political party, no matter how *"socialist"* or
*"revolutionary"* its ideas or rhetoric. This means that Bolshevik
restrictions on working class freedom (of speech, assembly, press,
organisation) struck at the heart of the revolution. It did not signify
the defence of the revolution, but rather its defeat. Ultimately, as
Emma Goldman quickly recognised, what the Bolsheviks called *"defence of
the Revolution"* was *"really only the defence of [the] party in
power."* [**My Disillusionment in Russia**, p. 57]

Anarchists had long argued that, to quote Goldman again, there is *"no
greater fallacy than the belief that aims and purposes are one thing,
while methods and tactics are another. This conception is a potent
menace to social regeneration. All human experience teaches that methods
and means cannot be separated from the ultimate aim. The means employed
become, through individual practice, part and parcel of the final
purpose; they influence it, modify it, and presently the aims and means
become identical."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 260] The evolution of Bolshevik
practice and theory reinforces this argument. The means used had an
impact on the course of events, which in turn shaped the next set of
means and the ideology used to justify it.

This explains the Makhnovist and Bolshevik differences in relationship
to working-class freedom. For anarchists, only freedom or the struggle
for freedom can teach people to be free (and so is genuinely
revolutionary). This explains why the Makhnovists not only proclaimed
freedom of election, speech, press, assembly and organisation for
working people, which was an essential revolutionary position, they also
implemented it (see [section 7](append46.html#app7)). The Bolsheviks did
the reverse, clamping down on the opposition at every occasion
(including workers' strikes and protests). For the Makhnovists,
working-class freedom was the key gain of the revolution, and so had to
be introduced, practised and defended. Hence Makhno:

> *"I consider it an inviolable right of the workers and peasants, a
> right won by the revolution, to call congresses on their own account,
> to discuss their affairs. That is why the prohibitions of such
> congresses, and the declaration proclaiming them illegal . . . ,
> represent a direct and insolent violation of the rights of the
> workers."* [quoted by Arshinov, **Op. Cit.**, p. 129]

For the Bolsheviks, working-class freedom was something to fear. Back in
1903, Lenin laid the groundwork for this by arguing that the
*"**spontaneous** development of the labour movement leads to it being
subordinated to bourgeois ideology."* He stressed that *"the working
class, exclusively by their own effort, is able to develop only trade
union consciousness . . . the theoretical doctrine of Social-Democracy
arose quite independently of the spontaneous growth of the labour
movement; it arose as a natural and inevitable outcome of ideas among
the revolutionary socialist intelligentsia."* This meant that *"Social
Democratic [i.e. socialist] consciousness . . . could only be brought to
them from without."* [**Essential Works of Lenin**, p. 82 and pp. 74-5]
Clearly, if the workers turned against the party, then the workers were
*"being subordinated to bourgeois ideology."* It was in their own
interests, therefore, for the party to subordinate the workers and so
soviet democracy became not an expression of working-class power but
rather something which undermined it!

This perspective can be seen when the Makhnovists liberated cities. In
Alexandrovsk and Katerinoslav, the Bolsheviks proposed to the
Makhnovists spheres of action - their **Revkom** (Revolutionary
Committee) would handle political affairs and the Makhnovists military
ones. Makhno advised them *"to go and take up some honest trade instead
of seeking to impose their will on the workers."* Instead, the
Makhnovists called upon *"the working population to participate in a
general conference .. . . and it was proposed that the workers organise
the life of the city and the functioning of the factories with their own
forced and their organisations."* [Arshinov **Op. Cit.**, p. 154 and p.
149] The differences between the Bolsheviks and Makhnovists could not be
clearer.

Lastly, we should note that while Lenin and the leading Bolsheviks
wholeheartedly opposed working-class economic self-management by factory
committees and instead urged "efficient" top-down one-man management,
the Makhnovists supported working-class self-management of production.
Under the Bolsheviks, as Arshinov argued, the *"nationalisation of
industry, [while] removing the workers from the hands of individual
capitalists, delivered them to the yet more rapacious hands of a single,
ever-present capitalist boss, the State. The relations between the
workers and this new boss are the same as earlier relations between
labour and capital, with the sole difference that the Communist boss,
the State, not only exploits the workers, but also punishes them himself
. . . Wage labour has remained what it was before, except that it has
taken on the character of an obligation to the State . . . It is clear
that in all this we are dealing with a simple substitution of State
capitalism for private capitalism."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 71] The
Makhnovist propaganda, in contrast, stressed the need for workers to
socialise the means of production and place it under their direct
management by their own class organs. In other words, the abolition of
wage slavery by workers' self-management of production.

Unsurprisingly, the Makhnovists supported the Kronstadt rebellion (see
the appendix ["What was the Kronstadt uprising?"](append42.html) for
more on Kronstadt). Indeed, there is significant overlap between the
Kronstadt demands and the ideas of the Makhnovist movement. For example,
the Makhnovist idea of free soviets is almost identical to the first
three points of the Kronstadt programme and their land policy the same
as point 11 of the Kronstadt demands. The Kronstadt rebels also raised
the idea of *"free soviets"* and the *"third revolution,"* common
Makhnovist slogans (see [section 3](append42.html#app3) of the appendix
["What was the Kronstadt uprising?"](append42.html) for details). As one
Bolshevik writer notes, it is *"characteristic that the
anarchist-Makhnovists in the Ukraine reprinted the appeal of the
Kronstadters, and in general did not hide their sympathy for them."*
[quoted by Malet, **Op. Cit.**, p. 108] Voline also noted that the
*"ideas and activities of the Makhnovist peasants were similar in all
respects to those of the Kronstadt rebels in 1921."* [**Op. Cit.**, p.
575]

In summary, the major difference between the Makhnovists and the
Bolsheviks is that the former stuck by and introduced their stated aims
of *"soviet power"* and working-class freedom while the latter rejected
them once they clashed with Bolshevik party policies.

15 How do the modern followers of Bolshevism slander the Makhnovists?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Many modern-day supporters of Bolshevism, on the rare occasions when
they do mention the Makhnovist movement, simply repeat the old Bolshevik
(and Stalinist) slanders against them.

For example, this is what Joseph Seymour of the U.S. **Spartacus
League** did. Their newspaper **Workers Vanguard** ran a series entitled
*"Marxism vs. Anarchism"* and in part 7, during his discussion of the
Russian Revolution, Seymour claimed:

> *"The most significant counter-revolutionary force under the banner of
> anarchism was the Ukrainian peasant-based army of Nestor Makhno, which
> carried out pogroms against Jewish communities and collaborated with
> White armies against the Bolsheviks."* [**Workers Vanguard**,
> 8/30/1996, p. 7]

Seymour, needless to say, made these accusations without providing any
documentation, and with good reason, for outside of Stalinist
hagiographies, no evidence exists to support his claims. As we indicated
in [section 9](append46.html#app9), the Makhnovists opposed
anti-Semitism and did **not** conduct pogroms. Equally, [section
12](append46.html#app12) proves that the Makhnovists did **not**
collaborate with the Whites in any way (although this did not stop the
Bolshevik press deliberately spreading the lie that they had).

More recently, the UK Leninist **Revolutionary Communist Group**
asserted in their paper that the Makhnovists *"joined with
counter-revolutionary White and imperialist armies against socialist
Russia. This band of brigands also carried out pogroms against Jewish
communities in the Ukraine."* [**Fight Racism! Fight Imperialism!**,
issue no. 174, p. 12] No evidence for such a claim was presented in the
original review article. When an anarchist pointed out their assertion
was *"falling back on a long tradition of Stalinist lies"* and asked for
*"any historical references"* to support it, the paper replied by
stating that while there were *"several"* references, it would give two:
*"E.H. Carr refers to it in his history of the civil war. Also the
anarchist historian Paul Avrich mentions it in his work **The anarchists
in the Russian Revolution**."* [**Op. Cit.**, no. 175, p. 15]

In reality, neither work says any such thing. Looking at the first
(unnamed) one, assuming it is E.H. Carr's **The Bolshevik Revolution**
there is no reference to pogroms carried out by the Makhnovists (looking
in the index for "Makhno"). Which, perhaps, explains why the paper
refused to provide a book title and page number. As far as the second
reference goes, Avrich made no such claim in **The Anarchists in the
Russian Revolution**. He **did** address the issue in his **Anarchist
Portraits**, concluding such charges are false.

And the name of the original article? Ironically, it was entitled *"The
anarchist school of falsification"*!

However, more sophisticated slanders, lies and distortions have been
levelled at the Makhnovists by the supporters of Bolshevism. This is to
be expected, as the experience of the Makhnovists effectively refute the
claim that the Bolsheviks had no choice but to act as they did. It is
hard to maintain a position that "objective conditions" made the
Bolsheviks act as they did when another mass revolutionary army,
operating in the same environment, did not act in the same way. This
means that the Makhnovists are strong evidence that Bolshevik politics
played a key role in the degeneration of the Russian Revolution. Clearly
such a conclusion is dangerous to Bolshevism and so the Maknovist
movement must be attacked, regardless of the facts.

A recent example of this is John Rees' essay *"In Defence of October"*
(**International Socialism**, no. 52, pp. 3-82). Rees, a member of the
UK Socialist Workers' Party (SWP) is at pains to downplay the role of
Bolshevik ideology in the degeneration of the Russian Revolution. He
argues that "objective factors" ensured that the Bolsheviks acted as
they did. The *"subjective factor"* was simply a choice between defeat
and defence against the Whites: *"Within these limits Bolshevik policy
was decisive."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 30] This explains his attack on the
Makhnovist movement. Faced with the same *"objective factors"* as the
Bolsheviks, the Makhnovists did not act in the same way. As such, the
*"subjective factor"* amounts to more than Rees' stark choice and so
objective conditions cannot explain everything.

Clearly, then, the Makhnovists undermine his basic thesis. As such, we
would expect a less than honest account of the movement and Rees does
not disappoint. He talks about the *"muddled anarchism"* of Makhno,
dismissing the whole movement as offering no alternative to Bolshevism
and being without *"an articulated political programme."* Ultimately,
for Rees, Makhno's *"anarchism was a thin veneer on peasant rebellion"*
and while *"on paper"* the Makhnovists *"appeared to have a more
democratic programme"* there were *"frauds."* [p. 57, p. 58, p. 61 and
p. 70]

The reality of the situation is totally different. Ignoring the obvious
contradiction (i.e. how can the Makhnovists have the appearance of a
*"democratic programme"* and, simultaneously, not articulate it?) we
shall analyse his account of the Makhnovist movement in order to show
exactly how low the supporters of Bolshevism will go to distort the
historical record for their own aims (see the appendix ["What was the
Kronstadt uprising?"](append42.html) for Rees's distortions about the
Kronstadt revolt). Once the selective and edited quotations provided by
Rees are corrected, the picture that clearly emerges is that rather than
the Makhnovists being *"frauds,"* it is Rees' account which is the fraud
(along with the political tradition which inspired it).

Rees presents two aspects of his critique of the Makhnovists. The first
is a history of the movement and its relationships (or lack of them)
with the Bolsheviks. The second is a discussion of the ideas which the
Makhnovists tried to put into practice. Both aspects of his critique are
extremely flawed. Indeed, the errors in his history of the movement are
so fundamental (and, indeed, so at odds with his references) that it
suggests that ideology overcame objectivity (to be polite). The best
that can be said of his account is that at least he does not raise the
totally discredited accusation that the Makhnovists were anti-Semitic or
*"kulaks."* However, he more than makes up for this by distorting the
facts and references he uses (it would be no exaggeration to argue that
the only information Rees gets correct about his sources is the page
number).

Rees starts by setting the tone, stating that the *"methods used by
Makhno and Antonov [a leader of the "Greens" in Tambov] in their fight
against the Red Army often mirrored those used by the Whites."* [**Op.
Cit.**, p. 57] Strangely enough, while he lists some for Antonov, he
fails to specify any against Makhno. However, the scene is set. His
strongest piece of evidence as regards Makhno's *"methods"* against the
Red Army come from mid-1920 after, it should be noted, the Bolsheviks
had engineered the outlawing of the Makhnovist movement and needlessly
started the very conflict Rees uses as evidence against Makhno. In other
words, he is attacking the Makhnovists for defending themselves against
Bolshevik aggression!

He quotes reports from the Ukrainian Front to blacken the Makhnovists,
using them to confirm the picture he extracts from *"the diary of
Makhno's wife."* These entries, from early 1920, he claims *"betray the
nature of the movement"* (i.e. after, as we shall see, the Bolsheviks
had engineered the outlawing of the Makhnovists). [**Op. Cit.**, p. 58]
The major problem for Rees' case is the fact that this diary is a fake
and has been known to be a fake since Arshinov wrote his classic account
of the Makhnovists in 1923:

> *"After 1920, the Bolsheviks wrote a great deal about the personal
> defects of Makhno, basing their information on the diary of his
> so-called wife, a certain Fedora Gaenko .. . . But Makhno's wife is
> Galina Andreevna Kuz'menko. She has lived with him since 1918. She
> **never** kept, and therefore never lost, a diary. Thus the
> documentation of the Soviet authorities is based on a fabrication, and
> the picture these authorities draw from such a diary is an ordinary
> lie."* [Arshinov, **History of the Makhnovist Movement**, p. 226f]

Ironically enough, Rees implicitly acknowledges this by lamely admitting
(in an end note) that *"Makhno seems to have had two 'wives'"* [**Op.
Cit.**, p. 78] And we should note that the source Rees uses for the fake
diary entries (W.H. Chamberlin's **The Russian Revolution**) uses as
**his** source the very Bolshevik documentation that Arshinov quite
correctly denounced over 70 years before Rees put pen to paper. Little
wonder Michael Palij, in his detailed account of the movement (**The
Anarchism of Nestor Makhno, 1918-1921**), fails to use it. So, in
summary, a major part of his account is based on falsehoods, falsehoods
exposed as such decades ago. This indicates well the quality of his case
against the Makhnovist movement.

As regards the "evidence" he extracts from this fake diary and Red Army
reports, it simply shows that Bolsheviks were shot by Makhno's troops
and Red Army troops died in combat. This went both ways, of course. In
*"military operations the Bolsheviks shot all prisoners. The Makhnovists
shot all captured officers unless the Red rank and file strongly
interceded for them. The rank and file were usually sent home, though a
number volunteered for service with the Insurgents."* Equally, *"[o]n
the occupation of a village by the Red Army the Cheka would hunt out and
hang all active Makhnovite supporters; an amenable Soviet would be set
up; officials would be appointed or imported to organise the poor
peasants . . . and three or four Red militia men left as armed support
for the new village bosses."* [David Footman, **Op. Cit.**, pp. 292-3]
As such, Rees' account of Makhnovist "terror" against the Bolsheviks
seems somewhat hypocritical. We can equally surmise that the methods
used by the Bolsheviks against the Makhnovists also *"often mirrored
those used by the Whites"*! And Rees lambastes socialist Samuel Farber
for mentioning the *"Red Terror, but not the Green Terror"* in Farber's
discussion of the Tambov revolt! All in all, pretty pathetic.

Rees' concern for the truth can be seen from the fact that he asserts
that Makhno's *"rebellion"* was *"smaller"* than the Tambov uprising and
distinguished from it *"only by the muddled anarchism of its leader."*
[**Op. Cit.**, p. 58] In fact, the Makhnovist movement was the bigger of
the two. As Michael Malet notes:

> *"The differences between them explain why the Makhnovshchina lasted
> over four years, the Antonovshchina less than one year. The initial
> area of the Makhno movement was larger, and later expanded, whereas
> the Antonov region was restricted to the southern half of one province
> throughout its existence. The Makhno movement became established
> earlier, and was well-known before its break with the soviet regime. A
> crucial factor was the period of peace between the Bolsheviks and
> Makhno during the first half of 1919, something Antonov never had. It
> allowed for political and social development as well as military
> build-up. It followed from this that Makhno attracted much more
> support, which was increased and deepened by the positive ideology of
> Makhno and the anarchists who came to help him. This was not a matter
> of being anti-State and anti-town -- all the Greens, including
> Antonov, shared this view in a less sophisticated form -- but a
> positive land policy and a realisation of the need to link up with the
> towns on a federal basis in the post-revolutionary society."* [**Op.
> Cit.**, p. 155]

Even in terms of troops, the Makhno movement was larger. The Antonov
rebellion had *"a peak of around 20,000"* troops. [Read, **Op. Cit.**,
p. 268] Makhno, in comparison, had a peak of about 40,000 in late 1919
[Palij, **Op. Cit.**, p. 112] (Read states a peak of around 30,000
[**Op. Cit.**, p. 264]). Even by the end of 1920, a few months into the
Tambov rebellion (it started in August of that year), the Makhnovists
still had 10 to 15 thousand troops. [Palij, **Op. Cit.**, p. 237]

In summary, the movement which lasted longer, covered a larger area and
involved more troops is classed by Rees as the smaller of the two!
Incredible -- but it does give a flavour of the scholarship involved in
his essay. Perhaps by *"smaller"* Rees simply meant that Makhno was
physically shorter than Antonov?

After getting such minor details as size wrong, Rees turns to the actual
history of the movement. He looks at the relations between the
Makhnovists and the Bolsheviks, accurately stating that they *"were
chequered."* However, he is wrong when he tries to explain what happened
by stating they *"reflect[ed] the fast changing military situation in
the Ukraine throughout the civil war."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 58] In fact,
as we will prove, the relationships between the two forces reflected the
military situation refracted through the ideology and needs of Bolshevik
power. To ignore the ideological factor in the Makhnovist-Bolshevik
relationships cannot be justified as the military situation does **not**
fully explain what happened.

The Makhnovists co-operated with the Red Army three times. Only two of
these periods were formal alliances (the first and last). Discussing the
first two pacts, Rees alleges that the Makhnovists broke with the
Bolsheviks. The truth is the opposite -- the Bolsheviks turned on the
Makhnovists and betrayed them in order to consolidate their power. These
facts are hardly unknown to Rees as they are contained in the very books
he quotes from as evidence for his rewritten history.

The first pact between the Makhnovists and the Red Army ended June 1918.
According to Rees, *"[c]o-operation continued until June 1919 when the
Insurgent Army broke from the Red Army"* and quotes Michael Palij's book
**The Anarchism of Nestor Makhno** as follows: *"as soon as Makhno left
the front he and his associates began to organise new partisan
detachments in the Bolsheviks' rear, which subsequently attacked
strongholds, troops, police, trains and food collectors."* [**Op.
Cit.**, p. 58] Rees is clearly implying that Makhno attacked the
Bolsheviks, apparently for no reason. The truth is totally different. It
is easy to show this -- all we need to do is look at the book he uses as
evidence.

Rees quotes Palij on page 177. This page is from chapter 16, which is
called *"The Bolsheviks Break with Makhno."* As this was not enough of a
clue, Palij presents some necessary background for this Bolshevik break.
He notes that before the break, *"the Bolsheviks renewed their
anti-Makhno propaganda. Trotsky, in particular, led a violent campaign
against the Makhno movement."* He also mentions that *"[a]t the same
time, the supplies of arms and other war materials to Makhno were
stopped, thus weakening the Makhno forces vis-a-vis the Denikin
troops."* In this context, the Makhnovists Revolutionary Military
Council *"decided to call a fourth congress of peasants, workers, and
partisans"* for June 15th, 1919, which Trotsky promptly banned, warning
the population that *"participation in the Congress shall be considered
an act of state treason against the Soviet Republic and the front."*
[**Op. Cit.**, p. 175 and p. 176]

The Bolsheviks had, of course, tried to ban the third congress in April
but had been ignored. This time, they made sure that they were not.
Makhno and his staff were not informed of Trotsky's dictatorial order
and learned of it three days later. On June 9th, Makhno sent a telegram
informing the Bolsheviks that he was leaving his post as leader of the
Makhnovists. He *"handed over his command and left the front with a few
of his close associates and a cavalry detachment"* while calling upon
the partisans to *"remain at the front to hold off Denikin's forces."*
Trotsky ordered his arrest, but Makhno was warned in advance and
escaped. On June 15-16th, members of Makhno's staff *"were captured and
executed the next day."* **Now** Palij recounts how *"[a]s soon as
Makhno left the front he and his associates began to organise new
partisan detachments in the Bolsheviks' rear, which subsequently
attacked strongholds, troops, police, trains and food collectors."*
[**Op. Cit.**, p. 177]

Palij *"subsequently"* refers to Makhno after Denikin's breakthrough and
his occupation of the Ukraine. *"The oppressive policy of the Denikin
regime,"* he notes, *"convinced the population that it was as bad as the
Bolshevik regime, and brought a strong reaction that led able young men
. . . to leave their homes and join Makhno and other partisan groups."*
[**Op. Cit.**, p. 190] As Makhno put it, *"[w]hen the Red Army in south
Ukraine began to retreat . . . as if to straighten the front line, but
in reality to evacuate Ukraine . . . only then did my staff and I decide
to act."* [quoted by Palij, **Op. Cit.**, p. 190] After trying to fight
Denikin's troops, Makhno retreated and called upon his troops to leave
the Red Army and rejoin the fight against Denikin. He *"sent agents
amongst the Red troops"* to carry out propaganda urging them to stay and
fight Denikin with the Makhnovists, which they did in large numbers.
This propaganda was *"combined with sabotage."* Between these two
events, Makhno had entered the territory of pogromist warlord Hryhoryiv
(which did **not** contain Red troops as they were in conflict) and
assassinated him. [**Op. Cit.**, p. 191 and p. 173]

It should also be noted that Palij states that it was the Whites who
*"were the main enemy that Makhno fought, stubbornly and
uncompromisingly, from the end of 1918 to the end of 1919."* [**Op.
Cit.**, p. 177]

Clearly, Rees's summary leaves a lot to be desired! Rather than Makhno
attacking the Bolsheviks, it was they who broke with him -- as Palij,
Rees's source, makes clear. Indeed, Makhno made no attempt to undermine
the Red Army's campaign against Denikin (after all, that would have
placed his troops and region in danger). Rather, he waited until the
Bolsheviks showed that they would not defend the Ukraine against the
Whites before he acted. As such, Rees misuses his source material and
used Palij as evidence for a viewpoint which is the exact opposite of
the one he recounts. The dishonesty is obvious. But, then again, it is
understandable, as Trotsky banning a worker, peasant and partisan
congress would hardly fit into Rees' attempt to portray the Bolsheviks
as democratic socialists overcome by objective circumstances! Given that
the Makhnovists had successfully held three such congresses to discuss
the war against reaction, how could objective circumstances be blamed
for the dictatorial actions of Trotsky and other leading Red Army
officers in the Ukraine? Better not to mention this and instead rewrite
history by making Makhno break with the Bolsheviks and attack them for
no reason!

Rees moves onto the period of co-operation between the insurgents and
the Bolsheviks. His version of what happened is that *"Denikin's advance
against Makhno's territory in autumn 1919 quickly forced a renewal of
the treaty with the Bolsheviks. Makhno harassed Denikin's troops from
the rear, making their advance more difficult."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 58]

A more accurate account of what happened would be that Makhno
reorganised his troops after the Bolsheviks had retreated and evacuated
the Ukraine. These troops included those that had been left in the Red
Army in June, who now left to rejoin him (and brought a few Red Army
units along too). After conducting quick and demoralising raids against
Denikin's forces, the Makhnovists were forced to retreat to the West
(followed by White forces). In late September, near Peregonovka, Makhno
inflicted a major defeat against the following Whites and allowed the
Makhnovists to attack across Denikin's supply lines (which stopped his
attack on Moscow thus, ironically, saving the Bolshevik regime).
Makhno's swift attack on the rear of the Whites ensured their defeat. As
the correspondent of **Le Temps** observed:

> *"There is no doubt that Denikin's defeat is explained more by the
> uprising of the peasants who brandished Makhno's black flag, then by
> the success of Trotsky's regular army. The partisan bands of 'Batko'
> tipped the scales in favour of the Reds."* [quoted by Palij, **Op.
> Cit.**, p. 208]

Palij argues that it was the *"rapidly changing military situation
[which] soon caused a change in the Bolsheviks' attitude toward
Makhno."* The two forces meet up on December 24th, 1919. However,
*"[a]lthough the Bolsheviks fraternised with the Makhno troops and the
commander even offered co-operation, they distrusted Makhno, fearing the
popularity he had gained as a result of his successful fight against
Denikin."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 209] It should also be stressed that **no**
formal treaty was signed.

Clearly, Rees' summary leaves a lot to be desired!

This is not the end of it. Rees even attempts to blame the Makhnovists
for the attack of General Wrangel. He argues that *"by the end of 1919
the immediate White threat was removed. Makhno refused to move his
troops to the Polish front to meet the imminent invasion and hostilities
with the Red Army began again on an even more widespread scale."* [**Op.
Cit.**, p. 58]

This, needless to say, is a total distortion of the facts. Firstly, it
should be noted that the *"imminent"* invasion by Poland Rees mentions
did not, in fact, occur until *"the end of April"* (the 26th, to be
precise). The break with Makhno occurred as a result of an order issued
in early January (the 8th, to be precise). [Michael Palij, **Op. Cit.**,
p. 219 and p. 210] Clearly, the excuse of *"imminent"* invasion was a
cover, as recognised by a source Rees himself uses, namely Palij's work:

> *"The author of the order realised at that time there was no real war
> between the Poles and the Bolsheviks at that time and he also knew
> that Makhno would not abandon his region .. . . Uborevich [the author]
> explained that 'an appropriate reaction by Makhno to this order would
> give us the chance to have accurate grounds for our next steps' . . .
> [He] concluded: 'The order is a certain political manoeuvre and, at
> the very least, we expect positive results from Makhno's realisation
> of this.'"* [Palij, **Op. Cit.**, p. 210]

This is confirmed by Rees' other references. David Footman, whom Rees
also uses for evidence against the Makhnovist movement, notes that while
it was *"true there were military reasons for reinforcing"* the Polish
frontier (although he also notes the significant fact that the war *"was
not to break out for another four months"*), it was *"admitted on the
Soviet side that this order was primarily 'dictated by the necessity' of
liquidating **Makhnovshchina** as an independent movement. Only when he
was far removed from his home country would it be possible to counteract
his influence, and to split up and integrate his partisans into various
Red Army formations."* He notes that there were *"other occasions
(notably in Siberia) of the Soviet authorities solving the problem of
difficult partisan leaders by sending them off to fight on distant
fronts"* and, of course, that *"Makhno and his staff . . . were
perfectly aware of the underlying Soviet motives."* Footman recounts how
the Makhnovist staff sent a *"reasoned reply"* to the Bolsheviks, that
there *"was no immediate response"* from them and in *"mid-January the
Central Committee of the Ukrainian Communist Party declared Makhno and
his force to be outside the law, and the Red Army attacked."* [**The
Russian Civil War**, pp. 290-1]

In other words, according to the sources Rees himself selects, the
Bolsheviks **started** the conflict in order to eliminate opposition to
their power!

Needless to say, the Makhnovists **did** realise the political
motivations behind the order. As Arshinov notes, *"[s]ending the
insurrectionary army to the Polish front meant removing from the Ukraine
the main nerve centre of the revolutionary insurrection. This was
precisely what the Bolsheviks wanted: they would then be absolute
masters of the rebellious region, and the Makhnovists were perfectly
aware of this."* In addition, *"neither the 14th Corps nor any other
unit of the Red Army had any ties with the Makhnovist army; least of all
were they in a position to give orders to the insurrectionary army."*
Nor does Rees mention that the Makhnovists considered the move
*"physically impossible"* as *"half the men, the entire staff and the
commander himself were in hospital with typhus."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 163]

Consider what Rees is (distortedly) accounting. The beginning of 1920
was a time of peace. The Civil War looked like it was over. The White
Generals had been defeated. Now the Bolsheviks turn on their allies
after issuing an ultimatum which they knew would never be obeyed. Under
the circumstances, a stupider decision cannot be easily found! Moreover,
the very logic of the order was a joke. Would be it wise to leave the
Ukraine undefended? Of course not and if Red Army units were to stay to
defend the region, why not the Makhnovists who actually came from the
area in question? Why provoke a conflict when it was possible to
transfer Red Army units to the Polish front? Simply put, Rees presents a
distorted picture of what was happening in the Ukraine at the time
simply so he can whitewash the Bolshevik regime and blacken the
Makhnovists. As he himself later notes, the Bolshevik-Makhnovist
conflict gave the White General Wrangel the space required to restart
the Civil War. Thus the Bolshevik decision to attack the Makhnovists
helped prolong the Civil War -- the very factor Rees blames the
degeneration of the Russian Revolution and Bolshevik ideology and
practice on!

It is **now** that Rees presents his evidence of Makhnovist violence
against the Bolsheviks (the Red Army reports and entries from the fake
diary of Makhno's wife). Arguing that the entries from the fake diary
*"betray the nature of the movement in this period,"* he tries to link
them with Makhnovist theory. *"These actions,"* he argues, *"were
consistent with an earlier resolution of the Insurgent Army which
declared that it was 'the actions of the Bolshevik regime which cause a
real danger to the worker-peasant revolution."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 59]

Firstly, given a true account of the second break between the
Makhnovists and Bolsheviks, it would be fair to conclude that the
resolution was, in fact, correct! However, such facts are not mentioned
by Rees, so the reader is left in ignorance.

Secondly, to correct another of Rees' causal mistakes, it should be
noted that this resolution was **not** passed by the Insurgent Army.
Rather it was passed at the Second Regional Congress of Peasants,
Workers and Insurgents held at Hulyai Pole on February 12th, 1919. This
congress had 245 delegates, representing 350 districts and was one of
four organised by the Makhnovists. Unsurprisingly, these regional
congresses are not even mentioned by Rees in his account. This is for
obvious reasons -- if the Makhnovists could organise congresses of
workers, peasants and insurgents to discuss the progress of the
revolution, then why could the Bolsheviks not manage it? Equally, to
mention them would also mean mentioning that the Bolsheviks tried to ban
one and succeeded in banning another.

Thirdly, the tone of the congress was anti-Bolshevik simply because the
Ukraine had had a taste of Bolshevik rule. As Rees himself acknowledges
in a roundabout way, the Bolsheviks had managed to alienate the
peasantry by their agricultural policies.

Fourthly, the Bolsheviks had engineered the outlawing of the
Makhnovists. Thus the actions of the Makhnovists were **not**
*"consistent"* with the earlier resolution. They were, in fact,
*"consistent"* with self-defence against a repressive state which had
attacked them first!

Looking at the congress where the resolution was passed, we find that
the list of *"real dangers"* was, quite simply, sensible and, in fact,
in line with Leninist rhetoric. The resolution acknowledged the fact
that the Bolshevik party was *"demanding a monopoly of the Revolution."*
As we discussed in [section 14](append46.html#app14), it was during this
period that the Bolsheviks explicitly started to argue that the
"dictatorship of the party" **was** the "dictatorship of the
proletariat." The resolution also stated:

> *"With deep regret the Congress must also declare that apart from
> external enemies a perhaps even greater danger, arising from its
> internal shortcomings, threatens the Revolution of the Russian and
> Ukrainian peasants and workers. The Soviet Governments of Russia and
> of the Ukraine, by their orders and decrees, are making efforts to
> deprive local soviets of peasants and workers' deputies of their
> freedom and autonomy."* [quoted by Footman, **Op. Cit.**, p. 267]

It also stated:

> *"the political commissars are watching each step of the local soviets
> and dealing ruthlessly with those friends of peasants and workers who
> act in defence of peoples' freedom from the agency of the central
> government . . . The Bolshevik regime arrested left Socialist
> Revolutionaries and anarchists, closing their newspapers, stifling any
> manifestation of revolutionary expression."*

Delegates also complained that the Bolshevik government had not been
elected, that it was *"imposing upon us its party dictatorship"* and
*"attempting to introduce its Bolshevik monopoly over the soviets."*
[quoted by Palij, [**Op. Cit.**, p. 154]

The resolution noted that the current situation was *"characterised by
the seizure of power by the political party of Communists-Bolsheviks who
do not balk at anything in order to preserve and consolidate their
political power by armed force acting from the centre. The party is
conducting a criminal policy in regard to the social revolution and in
regard to the labouring masses."* To top it off, point number three
read:

> *"We protest against the reactionary habits of Bolshevik rulers,
> commissars, and agents of the Cheka, who are shooting workers,
> peasants, and rebels, inventing all kinds of excuses . . . The Cheka
> which were supposed to struggle with counterrevolution . . . have
> turned in the Bolsheviks' hands into an instrument for the suppression
> of the will of the people. They have grown in some cases into
> detachments of several hundred armed men with a variety of arms. We
> demand that all these forces be dispatched to the front."* [quoted by
> Vladimir N. Brovkin, **Behind the Front Lines of the Civil War**, pp.
> 109-10]

We should also point out that Rees selectively quotes the resolution to
distort its meaning. The resolution, in fact, *"urges the peasants and
workers to watch vigilantly the actions of the Bolshevik regime that
cause a real danger to the worker-peasant revolution."* [quoted by
Palij, **Op. Cit.**, p. 154] We have listed some of the actions of the
Bolsheviks that the congress considered as a *"real danger."*
Considering the truth of these complaints, only someone blinded by
Bolshevik ideology would consider it strange that worker and peasant
delegates should agree to *"watch vigilantly"* those actions of the
Bolsheviks which were a *"real danger"* to their revolution!

Lenin (before taking power, of course) had argued that elections and
recall to soviets were essential to ensure that the workers control the
"workers' state" and that socialism required the elimination of
*"special bodies of armed men"* by an armed population. To this day, his
followers parrot his claims (while, simultaneously, justifying the exact
opposite in Lenin's Russia). Now, is Rees **really** arguing that the
Bolshevik monopoly of power, the creation of a secret police and the
clamping down on working people's freedom were **not** dangers to the
Russian Revolution and should not be watched *"vigilantly"*? If so, then
his conception of revolution includes the strange notion that
dictatorship by a party does not threaten a revolution! Then again,
neither did the Bolsheviks (indeed, they thought calling worker, peasant
and partisan congresses to discuss the development of the revolution as
the real danger to it!). If not, then he cannot fault the regional
congress resolution for pointing out the obvious. As such, Rees'
misquoting of the resolution backfires on him.

Significantly, Rees fails to mention that during this period (the first
half of 1920), the Bolsheviks *"shot ordinary soldiers as well as their
commanders, destroying their houses, confiscating their properties, and
persecuting their families. Moreover the Bolsheviks conducted mass
arrests of innocent peasants who were suspected of collaborating in some
way with the partisans. It is impossible to determine the casualties
involved."* The hypocrisy is clear. While Rees presents information
(some of it, we stress, from a fake source) on Makhnovist attacks
against the Bolshevik dictatorship, he remains silent on the Bolshevik
tactics, violence and state terrorism. Given that the Bolsheviks had
attacked the Makhnovists, it seems strange that that Rees ignores the
*"merciless methods"* of the Bolsheviks (to use Palij's phrase) and
concentrates instead on the acts of self-defence forced onto the
Makhnovists. Perhaps this is because it would provide too strong a
*"flavour"* of the Bolshevik regime? [**Op. Cit.**, pp. 212-3 and p.
213]

Rees makes great play of the fact that White forces took advantage of
the conflict between the Makhnovists and the Bolsheviks, as would be
expected. However, it seems like an act of ideological faith to blame
the victims of this conflict for it! In his attempts to demonise the
Makhnovists, he argues that *"[i]n fact it was Makhno's actions against
the Red Army which made 'a brief return of the Whites possible.'"* In
defence of his claims, Rees quotes from W. Bruce Lincoln's **Red
Victory**. However, looking at Lincoln's work we discover that Lincoln
is well aware who is to blame for the return of the Whites.
Unsurprisingly, it is **not** the Makhnovists:

> *"Once Trotsky's Red Army had crushed Iudenich and Kolchak and driven
> Deniken's forces back upon their bases in the Crimea and the Kuban, it
> turned upon Makhno's partisan forces with a vengeance . . . [I]n
> mid-January 1920, after a typhus epidemic had decimated his forces, a
> re-established Central Committee of the Ukrainian Communist Party
> declared Makhno an outlaw. Yet the Bolsheviks could not free
> themselves from Makhno's grasp so easily, and it became one of the
> supreme ironies of the Russian Civil War that his attacks against the
> rear of the Red Army made it possible for the resurrected White armies
> . . . to return briefly to the southern Ukraine in 1920."* [**Red
> Victory**, p. 327]

Ignoring the fact that Rees does not bother to give the correct quote (a
problem that re-occurs frequently in his essay), it can be seen that he
does paraphrase the last sentence of Lincoln's work correctly. Strange,
then, that he ignores the rest of his account which clearly indicates
that the Bolsheviks *"turned upon"* the Makhnovists and *"declared
Makhno an outlaw."* Obviously such trivial facts as the initial
Bolshevik attacks against the Makhnovists are unimportant to
understanding what actually happened in this period. Informing his
readers that it was the Bolsheviks' betrayal of the Makhnovists which
provoked the resistance that *"made it possible for . . . the White
armies . . . to return briefly"* would confuse them with facts and so it
goes unmentioned.

Lincoln, it must be stressed, concurs with Rees's other main sources
(Palij and Footman) on the fact that the Bolsheviks betrayed the
Makhnovists! Clearly, Rees has rewritten history and distorted **all**
of his main references on the Makhnovist movement. After reading the
same fact in three different sources, you would think that the Bolshevik
betrayal of the Makhnovists which provoked their resistance against them
would warrant **some** mention, but no! In true Stalinist fashion, Rees
managed to turn a Bolshevik betrayal of the Makhnovists into a stick
with which to beat them with! Truly amazing.

Simply put, if the Bolsheviks had not wanted to impose their rule over
the Ukraine, then the conflict with the Makhnovists need not have taken
place and Wrangel would not have been in a position to invade the
Ukraine. Why did the Bolsheviks act in this way? There was no
*"objective factor"* for this action and so we must turn to Bolshevik
ideology.

As we proved in [section 14](append46.html#app14), Bolshevik ideology by
this time identified Bolshevik party dictatorship as the only expression
of "the dictatorship of the proletariat." Does Rees **really** believe
that such perspectives had no impact on how the Bolsheviks acted during
the Revolution? The betrayal of the Makhnovists can only be understood
in terms of the *"subjective factor"* Rees seeks to ignore. If you
think, as the Bolsheviks clearly did, that the dictatorship of the
proletariat equalled the dictatorship of the party (and vice versa) then
anything which threatened the rule of the party had to be destroyed.
Whether this was soviet democracy or the Makhnovists did not matter. The
Makhnovist idea of worker and peasant self-management, like soviet
democracy, could not be reconciled with the Bolshevik ideology. As such,
Bolshevik policy explains the betrayals of the Makhnovists.

Not satisfied with distorting his source material to present the
Makhnovists as the guilty party in the return of Wrangel, he decides to
blame the initial success of Wrangel on them as well. He quotes Michael
Palij as follows: *"As Wrangel advanced . . . Makhno retreated north . .
. leaving behind small partisan units in the villages and towns to carry
out covert destruction of the Bolshevik administrative apparatus and
supply bases."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 59] He again sources Palij's work on
the *"effective"* nature of these groups, stating that White Colonel
Noga reported to headquarters that Makhno was critical to Wrangel's
advance.

As regards the claims that Makhno was *"critical"* to Wrangel's advance,
Colonal Noga actually states that it was *"peasant uprisings under
Makhno and many other partisan detachments"* which gave *"the Reds no
rest."* [quoted by Palij, **Op. Cit.**, p. 214] However, what Rees fails
to mention is that Palij argues that it was the Bolshevik *"policy of
terror and exploitation"* which had *"turned almost all segments of
Ukrainian society against the Bolsheviks, substantially strengthened the
Makhno movement, and consequently facilitated the advance of the
reorganised anti-Bolshevik force of General Wrangel from the Crimea into
South Ukraine, the Makhno region."* [Palij, **Op. Cit.**, p. 214] Again,
Makhno is blamed for the inevitable results of Bolshevik policies and
actions!

It should also be reported that Noga's comments are dated 25th March
1920, while Palij's summary of Makhno's activities retreating from
Wrangel was about June 1920 -- 2 months later! As regards this advance
by Wrangel, Palij argues that it was the *"outbreak of the
Polish-Bolshevik war at the end of April"* which *"benefited Wrangel"*
and *"enabled him to launch an offensive against the Bolsheviks in
Tavriia on June 6th."* Indeed, it was after a *"series of battles"* that
Wrangel *"penetrated north, forcing a general Bolshevik retreat."* Now,
*"[a]s Wrangel advanced deeper into the Left Bank, Makhno retreated
north to the Kharkiv region, leaving behind small partisan units in the
villages and towns to carry on covert destruction of the Bolshevik
administrative apparatus and supply bases."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 219]
Again, Rees' account has little bearing to reality or the source
material he uses.

Rees continues to re-write history by arguing that *"Makhno did not
fight with the Reds again until October 1920 when Wrangel advanced on
Makhno's base."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 59] In fact, it was the
**Makhnovists** who contacted the Bolsheviks in July and August in 1920
with a view to suspending hostilities and co-operating in the fight
against Wrangel. This decision was made at a mass assembly of
insurgents. Sadly, the Bolsheviks made no response. Only in September,
after Wrangel had occupied many towns, did the Bolsheviks enter into
negotiations. [Arshinov, **Op. Cit.**, pp. 176-7] This is confirmed by
Footman, who states that it is *"agreed that the initiative for joint
action against Wrangel came from the Makhnovists"* [**Op. Cit.**, p.
294], as well as by Palij, who notes that *"Makhno was compelled to seek
an understanding with the Bolsheviks"* but *"no reply was received."* It
was *"Wrangel's success [which] caused the Bolshevik leaders to
reconsider Makhno's earlier proposal."* [**Op. Cit.**, pp. 222-3]
Obviously indicating that the Makhnovists placed the struggle against
the White counter-revolution above their own politics would place the
Bolsheviks in a bad light, and so Rees fails to give the details behind
the agreement of joint action against Wrangel.

As regards this third and final break, Rees states that it was
(*"unsurprisingly"*) a *"treaty of convenience on the part of both sides
and as soon as Wrangel was defeated at the end of the year the Red Army
fought Makhno until he have up the struggle."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 59]
Which, as far as it goes, is true. Makhno, however, *"assumed [that] the
forthcoming conflict with the Bolsheviks could be limited to the realm
of ideas"* and that they *"would not attack his movement immediately."*
[Palij, **Op. Cit.**, p. 231] He was wrong. Instead the Bolsheviks
attacked the Makhnovists without warning and, unlike the other breaks,
without pretext (although leaflets handed out to the Red Army stated
that **Makhno** had *"violat[ed] the agreement"*! [Palij, **Op. Cit.**,
p. 236]).

It would be a good idea to reproduce the agreement which the Bolsheviks
ripped up. There were two parts, a military and a political one. The
military one is pretty straight forward (although the clause on the
Makhnovists refusing to accept Red Army detachments or deserters
suggests that the Makhnovists' democratic army was seen by many Red Army
soldiers as a better alternative to Trotsky's autocratic structure). The
political agreement was as follows:

> *"1. Immediate release, and an end to the persecution of all Makhno
> men and anarchists in the territories of the Soviet Republics, except
> those who carry on armed resistance against Soviet authorities.*
>
> "2. Makhno men and anarchists were to have complete freedom of
> expression of their ideas and principles, by speech and the press,
> provided that nothing was expressed that tended to a violent overthrow
> of Soviet government, and on condition that military censorship be
> respected. . .
>
> "3. Makhno men and anarchists were to enjoy full rights of

> Cit.**, p. 224]

Needless to say, the Bolsheviks delayed the publication of the political
agreement several until several days after the military one was
published -- *"thus blurring its real meaning."* [Palij, **Op. Cit.**,
p. 225] Clearly, as it stands, the agreement just gave the Makhnovists
and anarchists the rights they should have had according to the Soviet
Constitution! Little wonder the Bolsheviks ignored it -- they also
ignored their own constitution. However, it is the fourth point of the
political agreement which gives the best insight into the nature of
Bolshevism. This last point was never ratified by the Bolsheviks as it
was *"absolutely unacceptable to the dictatorship of the proletariat."*
[quoted by Palij, **Ibid.**] This clause was:

> *"One of the basic principles of the Makhno movement being the
> struggle for the self-administration of the toilers, the Partisan Army
> brings up a fourth point: in the region of the Makhno movement, the
> worker and peasant population is to organise and maintain its own free
> institutions for economic and political self-administration; this
> region is subsequently federated with Soviet republics by means of
> agreements freely negotiated with the appropriate Soviet governmental
> organ."* [quoted by Palij, **Op. Cit.**, p. 224]

Clearly, this idea of worker and peasant self-management, like soviet
democracy, could not be reconciled with the Bolshevik support for party
dictatorship as the expression of *"the dictatorship of the
proletariat"* which had become a Bolshevik ideological truism by that
time. Little wonder the Bolsheviks failed to ratify the fourth clause
and violated the other agreements. Simply put, a libertarian alternative
to Bolshevism would give the Russian and Ukrainian working masses hope
of freedom and make them harder to control. It is unsurprising that Rees
fails to discuss the treaty -- it would, yet again, undermine his case
that the Bolsheviks were forced by objective circumstances to be
dictatorial.

And, of course, let us not forget the circumstances in which this
betrayal took place. The country was, as Rees reminds us, in a state of
economic disruption and collapse. Indeed, Rees blames the anti-working
class and dictatorial actions and policies of the Bolsheviks on the
chaos caused by the civil war. Yet here are the Bolsheviks prolonging
this very Civil War by turning (yet again!) on their allies. After the
defeat of the Whites, the Bolsheviks preferred to attack the Makhnovists
rather than allow them the freedom they had been fighting for. Resources
which could have been used to aid the economic rebuilding of Russia and
the Ukraine were used to attack their former allies. The talents and
energy of the Makhnovists were either killed or wasted in a pointless
conflict. Should we be surprised? After all, the Bolsheviks had
preferred to compound their foes during the Civil War (and, indirectly,
aid the very Whites they were fighting) by betraying their Makhnovist
allies on two previous occasions (once, because the Makhnovists had
dared call a conference of working people to discuss the civil war being
fought in their name). Clearly, Bolshevik politics and ideology played a
key role in all these decisions. They were **not** driven by terrible
objective circumstances (indeed, they made them worse).

Rees obviously distorted the truth about the first two agreements
between the Makhnovists and the Bolsheviks. He portrayed the Makhnovists
as the guilty party, "breaking" with the Bolsheviks when in fact it was
(in both cases) the Bolsheviks who broke with and betrayed the
Makhnovists. That explains why he fails to present any information on
**why** the first break happened and why he distorts the events of the
second. It cannot be said that he was unaware of these facts -- they are
in the very books he himself references! As such, we have a clear and
intended desire to deceive the reader. As regards the third agreement,
while he makes no pretence that the Makhnovists were the guilty party
however, he implies that the Bolsheviks had to act as they did before
the Makhnovists turned on them. Little wonder, then, that he does not
provide the details of the agreement made between the Bolsheviks and
Makhnovists -- to do so would have been to expose the authoritarianism
of the Bolsheviks. Simply put, Rees'distortions of the source material
he uses comes as no surprise. It undermines his basic argument and so
cannot be used in its original form. Hence the cherry-picking of
quotations to support his case.

After distorting Makhnovist relations with the Bolsheviks, Rees moves on
to distorting the socio-political ideas and practice of the Makhnovists.
As would be expected from his hatchet-job on the military history of the
movement, his account of its social ideas leaves much to be desired.
However, both aspects of his critique have much in common. His account
of its theoretical ideas and its attempts to apply them again abuse the
source material in disgraceful ways.

For example, Rees states that under the Makhnovists *"[p]apers could be
published, but the Bolshevik and Left Socialist Revolutionary press were
not allowed to call for revolution"* and references Michael Palij's
book. [**Op. Cit.**, p. 60] Looking at the page in question, we discover
a somewhat different account. According to Palij's work, what the
Makhnovists **actually** *"prohibited"* was that these parties should
*"propagate armed uprisings against the Makhnovist movement."* A clear
rewriting of the source material and an indication of how low Leninists
will sink. Significantly, Palij also notes that this *"freedom of
speech, press, assembly and association"* was implemented *"[i]n
contrast to the Bolshevik regime"* and its policy of crushing such
liberties. [**Op. Cit.** pp. 152-3] Ironically, the military-political
agreement of late 1920 between the Reds and Makhnovists included a
similar clause, banning expression that *"tended to a violent overthrow
of the Soviet government."* [quoted by Palij, **OP. Cit.**, p. 224]
Which means, to use Rees' distorted terminology, that the Bolsheviks
banned calls for revolution!

However, this distortion of the source material **does** give us an
insight into the mentality of Leninism. After all, according to Palij,
when the Makhnovists entered a city or town they *"immediately announced
to the population that the army did not intend to exercise political
authority."* The workers and peasants were to set up soviets *"that
would carry out the will and orders of their constituents"* as well as
*"organis[e] their own self-defence force against counter-revolution and
banditry."* These political changes were matched in the economic sphere
as well, as the *"holdings of the landlords, the monasteries and the
state, including all livestocks and goods, were to be transferred to the
peasants"* and *"all factories, plants, mines, and other means of
production were to become property of all the workers under control of
their professional unions."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 151]

In such an environment, a call for *"revolution"* (or, more correctly,
*"armed uprisings against the Makhno movement"*) could only mean a
Bolshevik coup to install a Bolshevik party dictatorship. As the
Makhnovists were clearly defending working- class and peasant
self-government, then a Bolshevik call for *"armed uprisings"* against
them also meant the end of such free soviets and their replacement with
party dictatorship. Little wonder Rees distorts his source! Arshinov
makes the situation clear:

> *"The only restriction that the Makhnovists considered necessary to
> impose on the Bolsheviks, the left Socialist Revolutionaries and other
> statists was a prohibition on the formation of those 'revolutionary
> committees' which sought to impose a dictatorship over the people. In
> Aleksandrovsk and Ekaterinoslav, right after the occupation of these
> cities by the Makhnovists, the Bolsheviks hastened to organise
> **Revkoms** (**Revolutionary Committees** ) seeking to organise their
> political power and govern the population . . . Makhno advised them to
> go and take up some honest trade instead of seeking to impose their
> will on the workers . . . In this context the Makhnovists' attitude
> was completely justified and consistent. To protect the full freedom
> of speech, press, and organisation, they had to take measures against
> formations which sought to stifle this freedom, to suppress other
> organisations, and to impose their will and dictatorial authority on
> the workers."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 154]

Little wonder Rees distorts the issues and transforms a policy to defend
the **real** revolution into one which banned a *"call for revolution"*!
We should be grateful that he distorted the Makhnovist message for it
allows us to indicate the dictatorial nature of the regime and politics
Rees is defending.

All of which disproves Rees' assertion that *"the movement never had any
real support from the working class. Neither was it particularly
interested in developing a programme which would appeal to the
workers."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 59] Now, Rees had obviously read Palij's
summary of Makhnovist ideas. Is he claiming that workers'
self-management and the socialisation of the means of production do not
*"appeal"* to workers? After all, most Leninists pay lip-service to
these ideas. Is Rees arguing that the Bolshevik policies of the time
(namely one-man management and the militarisation of labour)
*"appealed"* to the workers more than workers' self-management of
production? Equally, the Makhnovists argued that the workers should form
their own free soviets which would *"carry out the will and orders of
their constituents."* [Palij, **Op. Cit.**, p. 151] Is Rees **really**
arguing that the Bolshevik policy of party dictatorship *"appealed"* to
the workers more than soviet democracy? If so, then heaven help us if
the SWP ever get into power!

Luckily, as Jonathan Aves' book **Workers Against Lenin** proves, this
was not the case. Working-class resistance to Bolshevik policies was
extremely widespread and was expressed by strikes. It should be noted
that the wave of strikes all across Russia which preceded the Kronstadt
revolt also raised the demand for soviet democracy. The call for *"free
soviets"* was raised by the Kronstadt revolt itself and during the
"mini-Kronstadt" in Katerinoslav in June 1921 where the demands of the
workers *"were very similar in content with the resolutions of the
Kronstadt rebels"* and telegraph operators sent *"messages throughout
the Soviet Republic calling for 'free soviets.'"* [Jonathan Aves,
**Workers Against Lenin**, p. 172 and p. 173]

Clearly, the Makhnovists **did** create a *"programme that would appeal
to the workers."* However, it is true that the Makhnovists did fail win
over more than a minority of workers. This may have been due to the fact
that the Makhnovists only freed two cities, both for short periods of
time. As Paul Avrich notes, "he found little time to implement his
economic programs." [**Anarchist Portraits**, p. 121] Given how Rees
bends over backwards to justify Bolshevik policies in terms of
*"objective factors,"* it is significant that in his discussion of the
Makhnovists such *"objective factors"* as time fail to get a mention!

Thus Rees's attempt to paint the Makhnovists as anti-working class
fails. While this is the core of his dismissal of them as a possible
*"libertarian alternative to the Bolsheviks,"* the facts do not support
his assertions. He gives the example of Makhno's advice to railway
workers in Aleksandrovsk *"who had not been paid for many weeks"* that
they should *"simply charge passengers a fair price and so generate
their own wages."* He states that this *"advice aimed at reproducing the
petit-bourgeois patterns of the countryside."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 59] Two
points can be raised to this argument.

Firstly, we should highlight the Bolshevik (and so, presumably,
*"proletarian"*) patterns imposed on the railway workers. Trotsky simply
*"plac[ed] the railwaymen and the personnel of the repair workshops
under martial law"* and *"summarily ousted"* the leaders of the
railwaymen's trade union when they objected." The Central Administrative
Body of Railways (Tsektran) he created was run by him *"along strictly
military and bureaucratic lines."* In other words, he applied his ideas
on the *"militarisation of labour"* in full. [M. Brinton, **The
Bolsheviks and Workers' Control**, p. 67] Compared to the Bolshevik
pattern, only an ideologue could suggest that Makhno's advice (and it
was advice, not a decree imposed from above, as was Trotsky's) can be
considered worse. Indeed, by being based on workers' self-management it
was infinitely more socialist than the militarised Bolshevik state
capitalist system.

Secondly, Rees fails to understand the nature of anarchism. Anarchism
argues that it is up to working class people to organise their own
activities. This meant that, ultimately, it was up to the railway
workers **themselves** (in association with other workers) to organise
their own work and industry. Rather than being imposed by a few leaders,
**real** socialism can only come from below, built by working people,
through their own efforts and own class organisations. Anarchists can
suggest ideas and solutions, but ultimately its up to workers (and
peasants) to organise their own affairs. Thus, rather than being a
source of condemnation, Makhno's comments should be considered as
praiseworthy as they were made in a spirit of equality and were based on
encouraging workers' self-management.

Ultimately, the best reply to Rees is simply the fact that after holding
a *"general conference of the workers of the city"* at which it was
*"proposed that the workers organise the life of the city and the
functioning of the factories with their own forces and their own
organisations"* based on *"the principles of self-management,"* the
*"[r]ailroad workers took the first step in this direction"* by
*"form[ing] a committee charged with organising the railway network of
the region."* [Arshinov, **Op. Cit.**, p. 149]

Even more amazing (if that is possible) is Rees' account of the
revolution in the countryside. Rees argues that the *"real basis of
Makhno's support was not his anarchism, but his opposition to grain
requisitioning and his determination not to disturb the peasant
economy"* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 59] and quotes Palij as follows:

> *"Makhno had not put an end to the agricultural inequalities. His aim
> was to avoid conflicts with the villages and to maintain a sort of
> united front of the entire peasantry."* [M. Palij, **Op. Cit.**, p.
> 214]

However, here is the actual context of the (corrected) quote:

> *"Peasants' economic conditions in the region of the Makhno movement
> were greatly improved at the expense of the estates of the landlords,
> the church, monasteries, and the richest peasants, but Makhno had not
> put an end to the agricultural inequalities. His aim was to avoid
> conflicts within the villages and to maintain a sort of united front
> of the entire peasantry."* [M. Palij, **Op. Cit.**, p. 214]

Clearly, Rees has distorted the source material, conveniently missing
out the information that Makhno had most definitely "disturbed" the
peasant economy at the expense of the rich! And, we are sure that Rees
would have a fit if it were suggested that the real basis of Bolshevik
support was not their socialism, but their opposition to the war and the
Whites!

Amazingly, Rees also somehow manages to forget to mention the peasant
revolution which had started in 1917 in his attack against Makhno:

> *"Makhno and his associates brought socio-political issues into the
> daily life of the people, who in turn supported the expropriation of
> large estates . . . On the eve of open conflict [in late 1917], Makhno
> assembled all the landowners and rich peasants (kulaks) of the area
> and took from them all official documents relating to their land,
> livestock, and equipment. Subsequently an inventory of this property
> was taken and reported to the people at the session of the local
> soviet, and then at the regional meeting, It was decided to allow the
> landlords to share the land, livestock, and tools equally with the
> peasants."* [Palij, **Op. Cit.**, p. 71]

Obviously, Rees considers the expropriating of the landlords and kulaks
as an act which *"did not disturb the age-old class structure of the
countryside"*!

Let us not forget that the official Makhnovist position was that the
*"holdings of the landlords, the monasteries, and the state, including
all livestock and goods, were to be transferred to the peasants."*
[Palij, **Op. Cit.**, p. 151] At the second congress of workers,
peasants and insurgents held in February, 1919, it was resolved that
*"all land be transferred to the hands of toiling peasants . . .
according to the norm of equal distribution."* [quoted by Palij, **Op.
Cit.**, p. 155] This meant that every peasant family had as much land as
they could cultivate without the use of hired labour. The Makhnovists
argued with regards to the kulaks:

> *"We are sure that . . . the kulak elements of the village will be
> pushed to one side by the very course of events. The toiling peasantry
> will itself turn effortlessly on the kulaks, first by adopting the
> kulak's surplus land for general use, then naturally drawing the kulak
> elements into the social organisation."* [cited by Michael Malet,
> **Op. Cit.**, pp. 118-9]

Thus, just to stress the point, the Makhnovists **did** *"disturb"* the
*"age-old class structure of the countryside."*

Clearly, Rees is simply taking nonsense. When he states that Makhnovist
land policies *"did not disturb the age-old class structure of the
countryside,"* he is simply showing his utter and total disregard for
the truth. As the Bolsheviks themselves found out, no mass movement
could possibly exist among the peasants without having a positive and
levelling land policy. The Makhnovists were no exception.

Rees then states that *"[i]n 1919 the local Bolshevik authorities made
mistakes which played into Makhno's hands."* Unsurprisingly enough, he
argues that this was because they *"tried to carry through the
socialisation of the land, rather than handing it over to the
peasants."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 60] In fact, the Bolsheviks did **not**
try to implement the *"socialisation"* of land. Rather, they tried to
**nationalise** the land and place it under state control -- a radically
different concept. Indeed, it was the Makhnovists who argued that the
*"land, the factories, the workshops, the mines, the railroads and the
other wealth of the people must belong to the working people themselves,
to those who work in them, that is to say, they must be socialised."*
[contained in Arshinov, **Op. Cit.**, p. 273] The Bolsheviks, in
contrast, initially *"decreed that all lands formerly belonging to the
landlords should be expropriated and transformed into state farms."*
[Palij, **Op. Cit.**, p. 156] The peasants quite rightly thought that
this just replaced one set of landlords with another, stealing the land
which rightfully belonged to them.

After distorting the source material by selective quoting, Rees does it
again when he argues that *"by the spring of 1920 they [the Bolsheviks]
had reversed the policy towards the peasants and instituted Committees
of Poor Peasants, these 'hurt Makhno . . . his heart hardened and he
sometimes ordered executions.' This policy helped the Bolshevik
ascendancy."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 60]

Rees quotes Palij as evidence. To refute his argument we need simply
quote the same pages:

> *"Although they [the Bolsheviks] modified their agricultural policy by
> introducing on February 5, 1920, a new land law, distributing the
> former landlords', state and church lands among the peasants, they did
> not succeed in placating them because of the requisitions, which the
> peasants considered outright robbery . . . Subsequently the Bolsheviks
> decided to introduce class warfare into the villages. A decree was
> issued on May 19, 1920, establishing 'Committees of the Poor' . . .
> Authority in the villages was delegated to the committees, which
> assisted the Bolsheviks in seizing the surplus grain . . . The
> establishment of Committees of the Poor was painful to Makhno because

> supporters, even to the extent of hunting down and executing wounded
> partisans . . . Consequently, Makhno's 'heart hardened and he
> sometimes ordered executions where some generosity would have bestowed

> consequently facilitated the advance of the reorganised anti-Bolshevik
> force of General Wrangel from the Crimea into South Ukraine, the
> Makhno region."* [M. Palij, **Op. Cit.**, pp. 213-4]

Amazing what a *". . ."* can hide, is it not! Rees turns an account
which clearly shows the Bolshevik policy was based on informers, secret
police and the murder of rebels as well as being a total disaster into a
victory. Moreover, he also transforms it so that the victims are
portrayed as the villains. Words cannot do this re-writing of history
justice. Yes, indeed, an organisation of informers to the secret police
in every village can aid the *"ascendancy"* of a one-party dictatorship
(aided, of course, by overwhelming military force), but it cannot aid
the ascendancy of freedom, equality and socialism.

Given the actual record of the Bolsheviks' attempts to break up what
they considered the *"age-old class structure"* of the villages with the
*"Committees of the Poor,"* it is clear why Rees distorts his source.

It does seem ironic that Rees attacks the Makhnovists for not pursuing
Bolshevik peasant policies. Considering the absolute **failure** of
those policies, the fact that Makhno did not follow them is hardly cause
for condemnation! Indeed, given the numerous anti-Bolshevik uprisings
and large-scale state repression they provoked, attacking the
Makhnovists for not pursuing such insane policies is equally insane.
After all, who, in the middle of a Civil War, makes matters worse for
themselves by creating more enemies? Only the insane -- or the
Bolsheviks!

That Makhnovist land policy was correct and the Bolshevik one wrong can
be seen from the fact that the latter changed their policies and brought
them into line with the Makhnovist ones. As Palij notes, the Bolsheviks
*"modified their agricultural policy by introducing on February 5, 1920,
a new land law, distributing the formers landlords', state, and church
lands among the peasants."* This, of course, was a vindication of
Makhnovist policy (which dated from 1917!). Makhno *"initiated the
peasants' movement, confiscating and distributing landlords' land and
goods"* (and, unlike the Bolsheviks, *"encouraging the workers to take
over factories and workshops"*). As regards the Bolsheviks attempts to
break up what they considered the *"age- old class structure"* of the
villages with the *"Committees of the Poor,"* it was, as noted above, a
complete disaster and counter-productive. [**Op. Cit.**, p. 213 and p.
250] All in all, the Makhnovist policies were clearly the most
successful as regards the peasantry. They broke up the class system in
the countryside by expropriating the ruling class and did not create new
conflicts by artificially imposing themselves onto the villages.

Lastly, we must also wonder just how sensible it is to *"disturb"* the
economy that produces the food you eat. Given that Rees, in part, blames
Bolshevik tyranny on the disruption of the economy, it seems incredible
that he faults Makhno for not adding to the chaos by failing to
*"disrupt the peasant economy"*! However, why let logic get in the way
of a good rant!

As well as ignoring the wealth of information on Makhnovist land policy,
Rees turns to their attempts to form free agrarian communes. He argues
that Makhno's attempts *"to go beyond the traditional peasant economy
were doomed"* and quotes Makhno's memoirs which state *"the mass of the
people did not go over"* to his peasant communes, which only involved a
few hundred families. [**Op. Cit.**, p. 59]

Looking at Makhno's memoirs a somewhat different picture appears.
Firstly, Makhno states that there were *"four such agricultural communes
within a three- or four-mile radius of Hulyai-Pole,"* but in the whole
district *"there were many"* in 1918 (the period being discussed in his
memoirs). Makhno recounts how each *"commune consisted of ten families
of peasants and workers, totalling a hundred, two hundred or three
hundred members"* and the *"management of each commune was conducted by
a general meeting of all its members."* He does state that *"the mass of
people did not go over to it"* but, significantly, he argues that this
was because of *"the advance of the German and Austrian armies, their
own lack of organisation, and their inability to defend this order
against the new 'revolutionary' and counter-revolutionary authorities.
For this reason the toiling population of the district limited their
real revolutionary activity to supporting in every way those bold
spirits among them who had settled on the old estates [of the landlords]
and organised their personal and economic life on free communal lines."*
[quoted by Paul Avrich, **The Anarchists in the Russian Revolution**,
pp. 130-2]

Of course, failing to mention the time period Makhno was recounting does
distort the success of the communes. The Bolsheviks were evacuating the
Ukraine as part of their treaty with German and Austrian Imperialism
when the communes were being set up. This left them in a dangerous
position, needless to say. By July, 1918, the area was occupied by
Austrian troops and it was early 1919 before the situation was stable
enough to allow their reintroduction. One commune was named *"Rosa
Luxemburg"* (after the Marxist revolutionary martyr) and was mostly
destroyed by the Bolsheviks in June 1919 and completely destroyed by the
Whites a few days later. In such circumstances, can it be surprising
that only a minority of peasants got involved in them? Rather than
praise the Makhnovists for positive social experimentation in difficult
circumstances, Rees shows his ignorance of the objective conditions
facing the revolution. Perhaps if the peasants did not have to worry
about the Bolsheviks as well as the Whites, they would have had more
members?

All in all, Rees account of Makhnovist ideas on the peasant economy are,
to put it mildly, incorrect. They paint a radically different picture of
the reality of both Makhnovist ideas and practice as regards the
peasantry. Ironically, the soundness of Makhnovist policy in this area
can be seen from the fact that the Bolsheviks changed their land policy
to bring it into line with it. Not, of course, that you would know that
from Rees' account. Nor would you know what the facts of the Bolsheviks'
land policy were either. Indeed, Rees uses Michael Palij's book to
create a picture of events which is the exact opposite of that contained
in it! Very impressive!

Intent on driving the final nail into the coffin, he tries to apply
"class analysis" to the Makhnovists. Rees actually states that *"given
this social base [i.e the Makhnovists' peasant base] . . . much of
Makhno's libertarianism amounted to little more than paper decrees."*
[**Op. Cit.**, p. 60]

Ironically enough, the list of *"paper decrees"* Rees presents (when not
false or distorted) are also failings associated with the Bolsheviks
(and taken to even more extreme measures by the Bolsheviks)! As such,
his lambasting of the Makhnovists seems deeply hypocritical. Moreover,
his attempt to ground the few deviations that exist between Makhnovist
practice and Makhnovist theory in the peasant base of the army seems an
abuse of class analysis. After all, these deviations were also shared by
the Bolsheviks. As such, how can Rees justify the Bolshevik deviations
from socialist theory in terms of *"objective factors"* yet blame
Makhnovist ones on their *"social base"*? Do *"objective factors"* only
afflict Leninists?

Take for example his first *"paper"* decree, namely the election of
commanders. He states that *"in practice the most senior commanders were
appointed by Makhno."* In other words, the Makhnovists applied this
principle extensively but not completely. The Bolsheviks abolished it by
decree (and did not blame it on *"exceptional circumstances"* nor
consider it as a *"retreat"*, as Rees asserts). Now, if Rees' "class
analysis" of the limitations of the Makhnovists were true, does this
mean that an army of a regime with a proletarian base (as he considers
the Bolshevik regime) cannot have elected commanders? This is the
logical conclusion of his argument.

Equally, his attempt to *"give a flavour of the movement"* by quoting
one of the resolutions adopted by a mass meeting of partisans also
backfires (namely, *"to obey the orders of the commanders if the
commanders are sober enough to give them"*). Firstly, it should be noted
that this was, originally, from a Red Army source. Secondly, drunkenness
was a big problem during the civil war (as in any war). It was one of
the easiest ways of forgetting reality at a time when life was often
unpleasant and sometimes short. As such, the *"objective factor"* of
civil war explains this resolution rather than the social base of the
movement! Thirdly, Rees himself quotes a Central Committee member's
comment to the Eighth Party Congress that there were so many
*"horrifying facts about drunkenness, debauchery, corruption, robbery
and irresponsible behaviour of many party members that one's hair stands
on end."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 66] The Eighth Congress was in 1919. Does
this comment give a *"flavour"* of the Bolshevik regime under Lenin?
Obviously not, as Rees defends it and blames this list of horrors on the
objective factors facing the Bolsheviks. Why does the drunkenness of the
Makhnovists come from their *"social base"* while that of the Bolsheviks
from *"objective factors"*? Simply put, Rees is insulting the
intelligence of his readers.

The Makhnovist resolution was passed by a mass assembly of partisans,
suggesting a fundamentally democratic organisation. Rees argues that the
civil war resulted in the Bolshevik vices becoming institutionalised in
the power of the bureaucracy. However, as can be seen, the Makhnovists
practised democracy during the civil war, suggesting that the objective
factors Rees tries to blame for the Bolshevik vices simply cannot
explain everything. As such, his own example (yet again) backfires on
his argument.

Rees claims that *"Makhno held elections, but no parties were allowed to
participate in them."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 60] This is probably derived
from Palij's comment that the free soviets would *"carry out the will
and orders of their constituents"* and *"[o]nly working people, not
representatives of political parties, might join the soviets."* [**Op.
Cit.**, p. 151] This, in turn, derives from a Makhnovist proclamation
from January 1920 which stated:

> *"Only labourers who are contributing work necessary to the social
> economy should participate in the soviets. Representatives of
> political organisations have no place in worker-peasant soviets, since
> their participation in a workers' soviet will transform the latter
> into deputies of the party and can lead to the downfall of the soviet
> system."* [contained in Peter Arshinov's **History of the Makhnovist
> Movement**, p. 266]

Rees' comments indicate that he is not familiar with the make-up of the
Russian Soviets of 1917. Unlike the soviets from the 1905 revolution,
those in 1917 allowed *"various parties and other organisations to
acquire voting representation in the soviet executive committees."*
Indeed, this was *"often how high party leaders became voting delegates
to"* such bodies. It should *"be underlined that these party delegates
were selected by the leadership of each political organisation, and not
by the soviet assembly itself. In other words, these executive committee
members were not directly elected by the representatives of the
producers"* (never mind by the producers themselves). [Samuel Farber,
**Before Stalinism**, p. 31]

In addition, Russian Anarchists had often attacked the use of *"party
lists"* in soviet elections, which turned the soviets from working-class
organs into talking-shops. [Paul Avrich, **The Russian Anarchists**, p.
190] This use of party lists meant that soviet delegates could be
anyone. For example, the leading left-wing Menshevik Martov recounts
that in early 1920 a chemical factory *"put up Lenin against me as a
candidate [to the Moscow soviet]. I received seventy-six votes he-eight
(in an open vote)."* [quoted by Israel Getzler, **Martov**, p. 202] How
would either of these two intellectuals actually know and reflect the
concerns and interests of the workers they would be "delegates" of? If
the soviets were meant to be the delegates of working people, then why
should non-working class members of political parties be elected to a
soviet?

Given that the people elected to the free soviets would be **delegates**
and **not** representatives, this would mean that they would reflect the
wishes of their workmates rather than the decisions of the party's
central committee. As such, if a worker who was a member of a political
party could convince their workmates of their ideas, the delegate would
reflect the decisions of the mass assembly. As such, the input of
political parties would not be undermined in any way (although their
domination would be!).

As such, the Makhnovist ideas on soviets did not, in fact, mean that
workers and peasants could **not** elect or send delegates who were
members of political parties. They had no problems as such with
delegates who happened to be working- class party members. They did have
problems with delegates representing only political parties, delegates
who were not workers and soviets being mere ciphers covering party rule.

That this was the case can be seen from a few facts. Firstly, the
February 1919 congress resolution *"was written by the anarchists, left
Socialist Revolutionaries, and the chairman."* [Palij, **Op. Cit.**, p.
155] Similarly, the Makhnovist Revolutionary Military Soviet created at
the Aleksandrovsk congress in late 1919 had three Communists elected to
it. There were 18 delegates from workers at that congress, six were
Mensheviks and the remaining 12 included Communists [Malet, **Op.
Cit.**, p. 111, p. 124] Clearly, members of political parties were
elected to both the congresses and the Revolutionary Military Soviet. As
such, the idea that free soviets excluded members of political parties
is false -- they simply were not dominated by them (for example, having
executives made up of members of a single party or delegating their
power to a government as per the national soviet in Russia). This could,
of course, change. In the words of the Makhnovist reply to Bolshevik
attempts to ban one of their congresses:

> *"The Revolutionary Military Council . . . holds itself above the
> pressure and influence of all parties and only recognises the people
> who elected it. Its duty is to accomplish what the people have
> instructed it to do, and to create no obstacles to any left socialist
> party in the propagation of ideas. Consequently, if one day the
> Bolshevik idea succeeds among the workers, the Revolutionary Military
> Council . . . will necessarily be replaced by another organisation,
> 'more revolutionary' and more Bolshevik."* [quoted by Arshinov, **Op.
> Cit.**, pp. 103-4]

As such, the Makhnovists supported the right of working- class
self-determination, as expressed by one delegate to Hulyai Pole
conference in February 1919:

> *"No party has a right to usurp governmental power into its hands . .
> . We want life, all problems, to be decided locally, not by order from
> any authority above; and all peasants and workers should decide their
> own fate, while those elected should only carry out the toilers'
> wish."* [quoted by Palij, **Op. Cit.**, p. 154]

Thus, Rees fails to present an accurate account of Makhnovist theory and
practice as regards *"free soviets."* Rather than oppose party
participation within their soviets and congresses, the Makhnovists
opposed the domination of soviets and congresses by political parties, a
radically different concept. Like the Kronstadt rebels, they argued for
all power to the soviets and not to parties.

Lastly, Rees attacks the Makhnovists for having two security forces, the
Cheka-like **razvedka** and the Punitive Commission. How this is an
expression of the Makhnovist *"social base"* is hard to explain, as both
the Bolsheviks and Whites also had their security forces and
counter-intelligence agencies.

While Rees quotes Footman's statement that *"we can safely assume [!]
these services were responsible for frequent injustices and
atrocities,"* he fails to mention that Footman does not provide any
examples (hence his comment that we can *"assume"* they occurred!).
Footman himself notes that *"[o]f the Makhnovite security services . . .
we know very little."* [David Footman, **Op. Cit.**, p. 288] Rees
himself only lists one, namely the summary shooting of a Bolshevik cell
discovered in the Army. Given the bloody record of the Bolshevik Cheka
(which, again, Rees defends as necessary to defend against the Whites!),
this suggests that the crimes of the Makhnovist counter-intelligence
pale in comparison.

Rees also quotes the historian Chamberlin that *"Makhno's private Cheka
. . . quickly disposed of anyone who was suspected of plotting against
his life."* [**Op. Cit.**, 60] Strangely enough, Rees fails to mention
the Bolshevik attempts to assassinate Makhno, including the one in the
latter part of May 1919 when, it should be noted, the Makhnovists and
Bolsheviks were meant to be in alliance. Nor does he mention that the
Cheka *"would hunt out and hang all active Makhnovites."* [David
Footman, **Civil War in Russia**, p. 271 and p. 293]

As regards the last conflict with the Red Army, it should be noted that
while *"generalised accusations of Makhnovist atrocities are common"*
the facts are it was *"the Makhnovists who stood to gain by liberating
prisoners, the Bolsheviks by shooting them."* This was because *"the Red
Army soldiers had been conscripted from elsewhere to do work they
neither liked nor understood"* and the *"insurgents had their own homes
to defend."* [Malet, **Op. Cit.**, p. 130] Thus, while Rees quotes
Footman's opinion that *"Makhno's later campaigns [were] among the most
bloody and vindictive,"* these facts suggest that we **cannot** *"safely
assume that these [security] services were responsible for frequent
injustices and atrocities."* Clearly, if the Makhnovists were releasing
Red Army prisoners (and many of whom were joining Makhno), the picture
of an atrocity inflicting army can hardly be a valid picture.

And it should be stressed that Bolshevik terror and violence against the
Makhnovists is strangely absent from Rees's account.

Rees presents just **one** concrete example of Makhnovist *"Cheka-like"*
violence, namely, the execution of a Bolshevik cell in December, 1919.
It should be noted that the Bolsheviks had been explicitly arguing for
Party dictatorship for some time by then. The reason why the Bolsheviks
had been *"denied an open trial"* was because they had already been
shot. Unfortunately, Makhno gave two contradictory reasons why the
Bolsheviks had been killed. This led to the Makhnovist Revolutionary
Military Soviet setting up a commission of three to investigate the
issue. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the commission exonerated Makhno although
Voline, out of the members, seemed to have been genuinely embarrassed by
the affair. [Malet, **Op. Cit.**, pp. 51-2] Needless to say, Rees fails
to comment on the Bolshevik summary killing of Makhnovist staff in June
1919 or, indeed, any other summary executions conducted by the
Bolsheviks against the Makhnovists (including the shooting of
prisoners).

Given the summary justice handed out by the Bolshevik Cheka, it seems
strange that Rees dismisses the Makhnovist movement on assumptions and
one event, yet he does. Obviously, the large-scale and continuous
Bolshevik killings of political enemies (including Makhnovists) is
irrelevant compared to this one event.

All in all, Rees' attempts to blame the few deviations the Makhnovists
had from anarchist theory on the *"social base"* of the movement are a
joke. While justifying the far more extreme deviations of Bolshevik
theory and practice in terms of *"objective factors,"* he refuses to
consider this possibility for the Makhnovists. The hypocrisy is clear,
if not unexpected.

One last point. Taking Rees' "class analysis" of the Makhnovists
seriously, the logical conclusion of his argument is clear. For Rees, a
movement which compromises slightly with its principles in the face of
extreme *"objective factors"* is *"petty bourgeois."* However, a
movement which compromises totally (indeed introduces and justifies the
exact opposite of its original claims) in face of the same *"objective
factors"* is *"proletarian."* As such, his pathetic attempt at "class
analysis" of the Makhnovists simply shows up the dictatorial nature of
the Bolsheviks. If trying to live up to libertarian/democratic ideals
but not totally succeeding signifies being *"petty-bourgeois"* while
dismissing those ideals totally in favour of top-down, autocratic
hierarchies is *"proletarian"* then sane people would happily be
labelled *"petty-bourgeois"*!

And Rees states that *"[n]either Makhno's social programme nor his
political regime could provide an alternative to the Bolsheviks"*!
[**Op. Cit.**, p. 60] Little wonder he distorts that social programme
and political regime -- an honest account of both would see that Rees is
wrong. The Makhnovist movement clearly shows that not only did Bolshevik
policies have a decisive impact on the development of the Russian
Revolution, there was a clear alternative to Bolshevik authoritarianism
and party dictatorship.

In summary, Rees' attack on the Makhnovists fails. It can be faulted on
both factual and logical grounds. His article is so riddled with errors,
selective quoting and downright lies that it is factually unreliable.
Similarly, his attempt to attack the Makhnovist political theory and
practice is equally factually incorrect. His attempt to explain the
deviations of Makhnovist practice from its theory in terms of the
*"social base"* is simply an insult to the intelligence of the reader
and an abuse of class analysis.

A far more compelling analysis would recognise that the Makhnovists were
not a perfect social movement but that the deviations of its practice
from its theory can be explained by the objective factors it faced.
Equally, the example of the Makhnovists shows the weakness of Rees' main
argument, namely that the objective factors that Bolshevism faced can
solely explain its authoritarian politics. That the Makhnovists, facing
the same objective factors, did not act in the same manner as the
Bolsheviks shows that Bolshevik ideology played a key role in the
failure of the revolution. This explains Rees' clumsy attempts to
rewrite the history and theory of the Makhnovshchina.

16 What lessons can be learned from the Makhnovists?
----------------------------------------------------

The Makhnovist movement was one of the most important events of the
Russian Revolution. It was a mass movement of working people who tried
and succeeded to implement libertarian ideas in extremely difficult
circumstances.

As such, the most important lesson gained from the experience of the
Makhno movement is simply that *"objective factors"* cannot and do not
explain the degeneration of the Russian Revolution or Bolshevik
authoritarianism. Here was a movement which faced the same terrible
circumstances as the Bolsheviks faced (White counter-revolution,
economic disruption, and so on) and yet did not act in the same manner
as the Bolsheviks. Where the Bolsheviks completely abolished army
democracy, the Makhnovists extensively applied it. Where the Bolsheviks
implemented party dictatorship **over** the soviets, the Makhnovists
encouraged and practised soviet self-management. While the Bolsheviks
eliminated freedom of speech, press, assembly, the Makhnovists defended
and implemented them. The list is endless (see [section
14](append46.html#app14)).

This means that one of the key defences of the Bolshevik Myth, namely
that the Bolsheviks had no choice but to act as they did due to
*"objective factors"* or *"circumstances"* is totally undermined. As
such, it points to the obvious conclusion: Bolshevik ideology influenced
the practice of the party, as did their position within the *"workers'
state,"* and so influenced the outcome of the Revolution. This means
that to play down Bolshevik ideology or practice in favour of
*"objective factors"*, one fails to understand that the actions and
ideas generated during the revolution were not "objectively" determined
but were **themselves** important and sometimes decisive factors in the
outcome.

Take, for example, the Bolshevik decision to betray the Makhnovists in
1920. Neither betrayal was "objectively determined" before- hand.
However, it did make perfect sense from a perspective which equated the
revolution with the *"dictatorship of the party."* That the first
betrayal undoubtedly extended the length of the Civil War by allowing
the Whites the space to reorganise under Wrangel also had its impact on
Bolshevik theory and practice as well as the *"objective factors"* it
had to face.

As such, the Makhnovists give a counter-example to the common
pro-Bolshevik argument that the horrors of the Civil War were
responsible for the degeneration of the Bolshevik Party and the
revolution. In the words of one historian:

> *"[The] Insurgent Army . . . was organised on a voluntary basis and
> respected the principle of election of commanders and staff. The
> regulations governing conduct were drawn up by commissions of soldiers
> and approved by general meetings of the units concerned. In other

> Tsar to Soviets**, pp. 264-5]

As such, another key lesson to be learned from the Makhno movement is
the importance of practising during a revolution the ideas you preach
before it. Means and ends are linked, with the means shaping the ends
and the ends inspiring the means. As such, if you argue for
working-class power and freedom, you cannot dump these aims during a
revolution without ensuring that they are never applied after it. As the
Makhnovist movement showed, even the most difficult situations need not
hinder the application of revolutionary ideas.

The importance of encouraging working-class autonomy also shines through
the Makhnovist experience. The problems facing a social revolution are
many, as are the problems involved in constructing a new society. The
solutions to these problems cannot be found without the active and full
participation of the working class. As the Makhnovist congresses and
soviets show, free debate and meaningful meetings are the only means,
firstly, to ensure that working-class people are *"the masters of their
own lives,"* that *"they themselves are making the revolution,"* that
they *"have gained freedom."* *"Take that faith away,"* stressed
Alexander Berkman, *"deprive the people of power by setting up some
authority over them, be it a political party or military organisation,
and you have dealt a fatal blow to the revolution. You will have robbed
it of its main source of strength, the masses."* [**ABC of Anarchism**,
p. 82]

Secondly, it allows the participation of all in solving the problems of
the revolution and of constructing the new society. Without this input,
**real** socialism cannot be created and, at best, some form of
oppressive state capitalist regime would be created (as Bolshevism
shows). A new society needs the freedom of experimentation, to adapt
freely to the problems it faces, to adjust to the needs and hopes of
those making it. Without working-class freedom and autonomy, public life
becomes impoverished, miserable and rigid as the affairs of all are
handed over to a few leaders at the top of a social hierarchy, who
cannot possibility understand, let alone solve, the problems affecting
society. Freedom allows the working class to take an active part in the
revolution. Restricting working-class freedom means the
bureaucratisation of the revolution as a few party leaders cannot hope
to direct and rule the lives of millions without a strong state
apparatus. Simply put, the emancipation of the working class is the task
of the working class itself. Either working class people create
socialism (and that needs workers' autonomy and freedom as its basis),
or some clique will and the result will not be a socialist society.

As the experience of the Makhnovist movement shows, working- class
freedom can be applied during a revolution and when it is faced with the
danger of counter-revolution.

Another key lesson from the Makhnovist movement is that of the need for
effective anarchist organisation. The Makhnovists did not become
anarchist-influenced by chance. The hard effort by the local anarchists
in Hulyai Pole before and during 1917 paid off in terms of political
influence afterwards. Therefore, anarchists need to take a leading role
in the struggles of working people (as we indicated in [section
I.8.2](secI8.html#seci82), this was how the Spanish anarchists gained
influence as well). As Voline noted, one of the advantages the
Makhnovist movement had was *"the activity of . . . libertarian elements
in the region . . . [and the] rapidity with which the peasant masses and
the insurgents, despite unfavourable circumstances, became acquainted
with libertarian ideas and sought to apply them."* [**Op. Cit.**, p.
570]

Arshinov expands on this issue in a chapter of his history (*"The
Makhnovshchina and Anarchism"*), arguing that many Russian anarchists
*"suffered from the disease of disorganisation,"* which led to
*"impoverished ideas and futile practice."* Moreover, most did not join
the Makhnovist movement, *"remained in their circles and **slept
through** a mass movement of paramount importance."* [**Op. Cit.**, p.
244 and p. 242]

Indeed, it was only in May 1919 that the *"Nabat"* Ukrainian anarchist
confederation was organised. This federation worked closely with the
Makhnovists and gained influence in the villages, towns and cities
within and around the Makhnovist region. In such circumstances, the
anarchists were at a disadvantage compared to the Bolsheviks, Mensheviks
and Socialist-Revolutionaries, who had been organised far longer and so
had more influence within the urban workers.

While many anarchists did participate effectively and organisationally
within many areas of Russia and the Ukraine (gaining influence in Moscow
and Petrograd, for example), they were much weaker than the Bolsheviks.
This meant that the Bolshevik idea of revolution gained influence (by,
it should be noted, appropriating anarchist slogans and tactics). Once
in power, the Bolsheviks turned against their rivals, using state
repression to effectively destroy the anarchist movement in Russia in
April 1918 (see [section 24](append41.html#app24) of the appendix ["What
happened during the Russian Revolution?"](append41.html) for details).
This, incidentally, led to many anarchists coming to the Ukraine to
escape repression and many joined the Makhnovists. As Arshinov notes,
the Bolsheviks *"knew perfectly well that . . . anarchism in Russia,
lacking any contact with a mass movement as important as the
Makhnovshchina, did not have a base and could not threaten nor endanger
them."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 248] Waiting till **after** a revolution
starts to build such a base is a dangerous tactic, as the experience of
the Russian anarchists shows. As the experience of the Moscow anarchists
active in the bakers' union shows, organised working-class support can
be an effective deterrent to state repression (the Moscow bakers' union
continued to have anarchists active in it until 1921).

It should be noted that this lesson was recognised by the main
anarchists associated with the Makhnovists. In exile, Voline argued for
the need to build a *"synthesis"* anarchist federation (see [section
J.3.2](secJ3.html#secj32)) while Arshinov and Makhno both associated
themselves with the Platform (see [section J.3.3](secJ3.html#secj33)).

Another key lesson is the need to combine rural and urban organisation.
As Voline argued, the *"absence of a vigorous organised workers'
movement which could support that of the peasant insurgents"* was a
major disadvantage for the Makhno movement. [Voline, **Op. Cit.**, p.
571] If there had been a workers' movement influenced by anarchist or
syndicalist ideas within the Ukrainian towns during the Russian
Revolution, the possibilities of constructive work would have been
increased immensely. Take the example of when the Makhnovists liberated
Aleksandrovsk and organised two workers' conferences. It was only at the
insurgents' insistence that the unions agreed to send delegates, but for
information only. This was undoubtedly due to the fact that Mensheviks
had some influence in the unions and Bolshevik influence was increasing.
Both parties may have preferred the Makhnovists to the Whites, but
neither accepted anarchist ideas of workers' self-management and so
constructive work was limited to the railway workers. In contrast, when
Katerinoslav was liberated, the bakers set themselves to preparing the
socialisation of their industry and drawing up plans to feed both the
army and the civilian population. Unsurprisingly, the bakers had long
been under anarcho-syndicalist influence. [Malet, **Op. Cit.**, p. 123
and p. 124]

As the Makhnovists themselves realised, their movement had to be
complemented by urban working-class self-activity and
self-organisations. While they did all they could to encourage it, they
lacked a base within the workers' movement and so their ideas had to
overcome the twin barriers of workers' unfamiliarity with both them and
their ideas and Marxist influence. With a strong working- class movement
influenced by anarchist ideas, the possibilities for constructive work
between city and village would have been helped immensely (this can be
seen from the example of the Spanish Revolution of 1936, where rural and
urban collectives and unions made direct links with each other).

Lastly, there is the lesson to be gained from Makhnovist co-operation
with the Bolsheviks. Simply put, the experience shows the importance of
being wary towards Bolshevism. As Voline put it, another disadvantage of
the Makhnovists was a *"certain casualness, a lack of necessary
distrust, towards the Communists."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 571] The
Makhnovists were betrayed three times by the Bolsheviks, who continually
placed maintaining their own power above the needs of the revolution.
The anarchists were simply used as cannon fodder against the Whites and
once their utility had ended, the Bolsheviks turned their guns on them.

Thus a lesson to be learned is that co-operation between anarchists and
Bolsheviks is fraught with danger. As many activists are aware,
modern-day supporters of Bolshevism constantly urge everyone to unite
*"against the common enemy"* and not to be *"sectarian"* (although,
somehow this appeal to non-sectarianism does not stop them printing
lying accounts of anarchism!). The Makhnovists took them at their word
in early 1919 and soon found out that *"unity"* meant *"follow our
orders."* When the Makhnovists continued to apply their ideas of
working-class self-management, the Bolsheviks turned on them. Similarly,
in early 1920 the Bolsheviks outlawed the Makhnovists in order to break
their influence in the Ukraine. The Makhnovist contribution to the
defeat of Denikin (the common enemy) was ignored. Lastly, in mid-1920
the Makhnovists placed the need of the revolution first and suggested an
alliance to defeat the common enemy of Wrangel. Once Wrangel had been
defeated, the Bolsheviks ripped up the agreement they had signed and,
yet again, turned on the Makhnovists. Simply put, the Bolsheviks
continually placed their own interests before that of the revolution and
their allies. This is to be expected from an ideology based on
vanguardism (see [section H.5](secH5.html) for further discussion).

This does not mean that anarchists and Leninists should not work
together. In some circumstances and in some social movements, this may
be essential. However, it would be wise to learn from history and not
ignore it and, as such, modern activists should be wary when conducting
such co-operation. Ultimately, for Leninists, social movements are
simply a means to their end (the seizing of state power by them on
behalf of the working class) and anarchists should never forget it.

Thus the lessons of the Makhnovist movement are exceedingly rich. Simply
put, the Makhnovshchina show that anarchism is a viable form of
revolutionary ideas and can be applied successfully in extremely
difficult circumstances. They show that social revolutions need not
consist of changing one set of bosses for another. The Makhnovist
movement clearly shows that libertarian ideas can be successfully
applied in a revolutionary situation.
