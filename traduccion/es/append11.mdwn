Respuesta a Algunos Errores y Distorsiones en "Anarchist Theory FAQ" 
version 5.2 de Bryan Caplan

1 - Individualist Anarchists and the socialist movement.
1 - Anarquistas Individualistas y el movimiento social. 
--------------------------------------------------------

Caplan, en este FAQ, intenta reescribir historia anarquista intentando
reclamar que el los anarquistas individualistas fueron precursores de
la escuela, por decirle de alguna manera, "anarco"-capitalista. Sin
embargo como es comun en el FAQ de Caplan, nada puede estar mas lejos
de la realidad.

En la seccion 5 (Que subdivisiones importantes pueden ser realizadas
entre los anarquistas?) de su FAQ, Caplan escribe:

> *"Un gran segmento de anarquistas-izquierdistas es extremadamente
> esceptica sobre las credenciales anarquistas de los anarco-capitalistas,
> argumentando que el movimiento anarquista fue historicamente de izquierda.
> En mi forma de ver, este es necesario para reescribir una gran parte de
> la historia para mantener este reclamo."* 

El cita a Carl Launder, **European Socialism: A History of Ideas and
Movements** como evidencia:

> *"Para estar seguros, hay una diferencia entre el anarquismo individualista
> y el colectivo o anarquismo comunista; Bakukin se llamaba a si mismo 
> anarco-comunista. Pero el anarquismo comunista tampoco reconocen ningun

> traves del poder del estado. El anarquisita individualista se inclina
> por mantener la propiedad privada como una condicion necesaria para
> la independencia del individual, sin responder completamente la
> pregunta de como puede mantenerse sin cortes ni policias."*

Caplan continua en comentar que *"el puntu interesante es que antes
de la emergencia del anarco-capitalismo moderno Landauer encontro 
necesario distinguir dos hilos del anarquismo, de los cuales solo uno
considero que seguia las bases de la tradicion socialista."*

Sin embargo, lo que Caplan parece ignorar es que ambos anarquistas
individualistas y socialistas coincinden en que **hay** una 
diferencia entre los dos tipo de escuelas de pensamiento anarquista! 
Una idea. Por supuesto, Caplan trata de sugerir que la no-discusion 
de Landauer sobre los anarquistas individualistas es "evidencia" de 
que sus ideas no son socialistas. Primero, el libro de Landauer es 
sobre Socialismo **Europeo**. Los Anarquistas Individualistas estan 
establecidos casi exclusivamente en Estados Unidos y dificilmente caigan 
en el topico que se trata. Segundo, del indice solo se menciona a
Kropotkin solo en dos paginas (de las cuales una es una nota al pie).
Acaso significa que Kropotkin no era un socialista? Por supuesto que no.
Pareciera, por lo tanto, que Landauer esta utilizando a la terminologia
Marxista comun para definir al Marxismo como Socialismo, mientras 
*llama* de otras partes del ancho movimiento socialista por sus 
auto-proclamados nombres anarquistas, sindicalistas y asi. 
Poco sorprendente que Kropotkin sea dificilmente mencionado en la 
historia del "Socialismo" (es decir, Marxismo).

Como fue mencionado anteriormente, ambas escuales del anarquismo
sabian que habia una diferencia entre sus ideas. Kropotkin y Tucker,
por ejemplo, ambos distingues los dos tipos de anarquismo como a los
dos tipos de socialismo. Por lo tanto el *"punto interesante"* de 
Caplan es una banalidad, un hecho comun del cual cualquiera que este
familiarizado se daria cuenta. Kropotkin en su famoso ensayo sobre
el Anarquismo para **La Enciclopedia Britanica** **tambien** 
encontro necesario distinguir las dos ramas del anarquismo. Respecto 
a los reclamos de Caplan de que solo una de esas ramas esta *"dentro
del espectro de la tradicion socialista"* todo lo que podemos decir
es que ambos Kropotkin **y** Tucker consideraron sus ideas y movimientos
ser parte de la tradicion socialista mas amplia.
De acuerdo al experto en Anarquismo Individualista, Tucker *"observo
al anarquismo como una rama del movimiento socialista general"* [James
J. Martin, **Men Against the State**, pp. 226-7]. Otros escritores del
Anarquismo Individualista notaron el mismo hecho (por ejemplo, Tucker
*"definitivamente pensaba sobre si como un socialista"* [William O.
Reichart, **Partisans of Feedom: A Study in American Anarchism**, p. 156]).
Como evidencia de la naturaleza anti-socialista del movimiento anarquista
individualista, la interpretacion de Caplan sobre las palabras de Landauer
es fundamentalmente un sin-sentido.
Si se observan las escrituras de gente como Tucker se podra apreciar
que ellso se llaman a su mismo socialistas y se consideran parte del
amplio movimiento socialista. Nadie familiarizado con el trabajo de Tucker
podria haber pasado por alto este hecho.

Interesantemente, Landauer incluye a Proudhon en su historia y declara
que el era *"el mas profundo pensador entre los socialistas pre-Marxistas."*
[p. 67] Dado que Caplan donde fuera en su FAQ intenta adherir a Proudhon
en su escuela "anarco"-capitalista como a Tucker, su cita sobre Landauer
parece particularmente deshonesta. Landauer presenta a las ideas de Proudhon
en profundidad en su trabajo dentro del capitulo encabezado **"The three
Anticapitaliststic Movements."** De hecho, empieza la discusion sobre las 
ideas de Proudhon con las palabras *"En Francia, el socialismo post-Utopico
comienza con Peter Joseph Proudhon."* [p. 59] Dado que ambos Kropotkin
y Tucker indican que las ideas politicas y economicas del Anarquismo 
Individualista de Proudhon siguieron al hecho que Landauer declara que 
Proudhon era un socialista implica que el Anarquismo Individualista es 
tambien socialista (or "Izquierdista" para utilizar al termino de Caplan).

Tucker y los otros anarquistas individualistas se consideraban a si mismo
como seguidores de las ideas de Proudon (como hicieron Bakunin y Kropotkin).
Por ejemplo, Tucker declaro en su diario **Liberty** que *"fue traido a la
existencia como una consecuencia directa de las ensenanzas de Proudhon"* y
*"vive principalmente para difundirlas"*. [citado por Paul Avrich en su
*"Introduccion"* a **Proudhon and his *"Bank of People"** por Charles A.
Dana]

Obviamente Landauer consideraba a Proudhon como socialista y si el 
Anarquismo Individualista sigue las ideas de Proudhon entonces, tambien,
debe ser socialista.

No sorprendentemente, entonces, Tucker tambien se consideraba a si mismo
un socialista. Para definir lo obvio, Tucker y Bakunin ambos compartian
la oposicion de Proudhon a la propiedad **privada** (en el sentido 
capitalista de la palabra), aunque Tucker confundio su oposicion (y otros
lectores casuales) al hablar de posesion como "propiedad".

Entonces, aparenta que Caplan es el que intenta reescribir la historia.

2 - Por que la definicion de Caplan sobre el socialismo esta mal?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Quizas el problema yace en la "definicion" de Caplan del socialismo.
En la seccion 7 (Es el anarquismo la misma cosa que el socialismo? /
Is anarchism the same thing as socialism?) declara:

> *"Si aceptamos una definicion tradicional del socialismo -- 'abogar
> por la propiedad del gobierno de los medios de produccion' -- parece
> que los anarquistas no son socialsitas por definicion. Pero si por
> socialismo nosotros nos referimos a algo mas inclusivo, como 'abogar
> por las fuertes restricciones o abolicion de la propiedad privada',
> entonces la pregunta se vuelve mas compleja."*

Las cuales son dificilmente definiciones tradicionales del socialismo
salvo que seas un ignorante de estas! Segun la primer definicion, 
Bakunin y Kropotkin no son socialistas. Respecto a la segunda, todos 
los anarquistas se opusieron a la propiedad privada (capitalista) y 
argumentaron por su abolicion y su reemplazo por la posesion. Las
formas actuales de posesion difieren entre las escuelas de pensamiento
anaruistas, pero el fin comun para abolir la propiedad privada 
(capitalista) estaba todavia ahi. Para citar a Dana, en un panfleto 
comenta *"una fuente realmente inteligente, fuerte y simpatica de
banca mutua"* por Tucker, a los deseos de los anarquistas individualistas
por *"destruir la tirania del capital, eso es, la propiedad"* por
credito mutuo. [Charles A. Dana, **Proudhon and his *"Bank of the People"**,
p. 46]

Interesantemente, esta segunda deficinion del socialismo saca a la luz
contradicciones entre los dichos de Caplan. En cualquier parte de su
FAQ menciona que Proudhon tenia *"ideas en la atraccion de una forma
modificada de la propiedad privada"*. De hecho, Proudhon deseaba 
restringir la propiedad privada de la posesion, como Caplan parece
notar. En otras palabras, incluso tomando su definicion notamos que
Proudhon seria considerado socialista! De hecho, respecto a Proudhon,
*"todo el capital acumulado es considerado propeidad, nadie debe ser
el dueno exclusivo."* [**Selected Writings of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon**, 
p. 44] Por lo anto el sumario de Jeremy Jennings de la posicion 
anarquista sobre la propiedad privada:

> *"El punto a tener en cuenta es que todos los anarquista [incluyendo
> a Spooner y Tucker], y no solo a aquellos casados a la predominante
> deformacion del siglo 20 del anarquismo comunista han sido criticos
> de la propiedad privada en la medida que era una fuente de jerarquia
> y privilegio."*

Continua en declarar que los anarquistas como Tucker y Spooner *"acuerdan
con la proposicion de que la propiedad era legitima solo en la medida que
era recibida no mas que como el producto total de la labor individual."*
[*"Anarchism"*, **Contemporary Political Ideologies**, Roger Eatwell y
Anthony Wright (eds.), p. 132]

La idea de que el socialismo pueda ser definido como propiedad estatal
o incluso en oposicion a, o "abolicion" de, todas las formas de propiedad
no es la mas correcta historicamente de todas las formas de socialismo.
Obviamente los comunistas-anarquistas y sindicalistas descartarian de
sus entrada la identificacion del socialismo como propiedad estatal, como
harian los Anarquistas Individualistas como Tucker y Joseph Labadie. Por 
oposicion o abolucion de todas las formas de "propiedad privada" como
definicion de socialismo, tal posicion hubiese sorprendido a los comunistas
anarquistas como Kropotkin (y, obviamente, los auto-proclamados socialistas
como Tucker y Labadie).

Por ejemplo, en **Act for Yourselves** Kropotkin explicitamente declara
que un campsino "*Quien en su posesion justa de terrenos puede cultuvar"*
no seria expropiado en la revolucion anarquista.
Lo mismo para la familia *"inhabitar una casa la cual les proporciona
la cantidad justa de espacio . . . considerado necesario para el numero
de personas"* o el artesano *"trabajando con sus propias herramientas
o telares"* que tambien serian dejados de lado [pp. 104-5]. El hace el
mismo punto en  **The Conquest of Bread** [p. 61] Por lo tanto, como
Proudhon, Kropotkin reemplaza **propiedad privada** con **posesion** dado
que el primero es *"robo"* (es decir que permite la explotacion, la cual
*"indica el alcance de la Expropiacion"* llamado *"aquello que permite a 
cualquier hombre [o mujer]. . .apropiarse del producto del trabajo de 
otro"* [**The Conquest of Bread**, p. 61])

Incluso Marx y Engels no definian al socialismo en terminos de la 
abolicion de todas las formas de "propiedad privada." Como anarquistas,
ellos distinguian entre la propiedad que permite que la explotacion
ocurra y la cual no. Mirando al **Manifiesto Comunistas** nos encontramos
con ellos argumentando que *""distinguiendo que las cualidades del Comunismo
*no son abolir de la propiedad en general sino la propiedad burguesa"* y
que *"el Comunismo no priva a ningun hombre del proder de aproopiarse de
los productos de la sociedad; sino del poder de subyugar el labor de otros
a traves de la apropiacion."* Por otra parte, ellos correctamente notan que
la "propiedad" ha significado diferentes cosas en diferentes momentos y que
la *"abolicion en relacion a la propiedad existente no es una caracteristica
distintiva del Comunismo"* como "*toda las relaciones de propiedad en el
pasado han sido sometidas continuamente a cambios historicos consecuencia 
de los cambios en las condiciones historicas."* Como un ejemplo, ellos
argumentan que la Revolucion Francesa *"abolido la propiedad feudal en
favor de la propiedad burguesa."* [**The Manifesto of the Communist
Party**, p.47, p. 49 and p. 47]

Lo cual indica que la idea del socialismo significa que la abolicion
de la "propiedad privada" es **solo** verdad para aquellos tipos de 
propiedad que son usados para explotar la labor de otros. Nicholas Walter
sumariza la posicion anarquista cuando escribio que los anarquistas *"estan
a favor de la propiedad privada la cual no puede ser utilizada por una
persona para explotar a otra."* [**Reinventing Anarchy**, p. 49] En otras
palabras, propeidad la cual no es realmente **privada** ya que es utilizada
por aquellos que no la poseen. En efecto, la clave del punto de Proudhon 
***What is Property?**, es la diferencia entre propiedad y posesion.
La cual indica que en lugar de desear la abolicion de todas las formas de 
"propiedad privada", los socialistas (de todo tipo, libertarios y autoritarios)
desean la abolicion de una clase particular de propiedad, lease la clase que
permite la explotacion y dominacion de otros. Ignorar esta distincion es pintar
un cuadro bastante enganoso sobre lo que el socialismo esta a favor.

Esto deja a la definicion de *"la fuerte restriccion . . . de la propiedad 
privada"* del socialismo. Aqui Caplan esta en terrenos mas concretos.
Desafortunadamente, por utilizar esta definicion los Anarquistas Individualistas,
como los Anarquistas Sociales, son incluidos en un campo socialista, una
conclusion que esta intentando evitar. Como **todo** anarquista comparte al
analisis de Proudhon que la *"propiedad es robo"* y que la **posesion** seria
la base del anarquismo, significa que todo anarquista es socialista (como Labadie
siempre declaro). Esto incluye a Tucker y otros Anarquistas Individualistas. 
Por ejemplo, Joseph Labadie declaro que *"dos grandes sub-divisiones del Socialismo"*
(anarquistas y socialistas estatales) ambos *"acuerdan que los recursos de la 
naturaleza -- tierras, minas, y demas -- no deben ser tomadas como propiedad privada
y estar sujetas a propositos individuales con fines especulativos, que el
uso de estas cosas han de ser el unico titulo valido, y cada persona tiene el
mismo derecho de utilizar todas las cosas. Todos acuerdan que el presente
sistema social es uno compuesto de clases de esclavos y clases de patrones, y
que es imposible impartir justica bajo estas condiciones. "* [**Que es Socialistmo?**]
Tucker mismo argumentaba que el titulo anarquista de *"ocupar y usar"*
las tierras y escasear materiales implicaria un cambio (y, en efecto, 
*"restriccion"*) del corriente (es decir, capitalista) estado de los 
derechos de propiedad:

> *"Sera notado que a partir de esta de definicion Anarquista de propiedad
> solo afecta a los productos. Pero todo es un producto sobre el cual
> la labor humana ha sido consumida. Debe ser declarado, sin embargo, que
> en el caso de las tierras, u otros materiales del cual el suministro 
> es tan limitado que no todo puede mantenerse en cantidades ilimitadas,
> el Anarquismo garantiza proteger no cualquier titulo sino los que
> esten basados en la ocupacion y uso."* [**Instead of a Book**, p. 61]

y entonces:

> *"ningun defensor de la ocupacion y uso cree que debe ser puesto
> en practica hasta que como teoria haya sido aceptada en general . . .
> vista y aceptada como es la teoria predominante del estado ordinario
> de la propiedad."* [**Occupancy and Use versus the Single Tax**]

Entonces, como puede ser apreciado, Anarquistas Individualistas rechazan
aspectos importantes de los derechos de propiedad capitalista. Dado que
Anarquistas Individualistas estuvieron escribiendo en un momento que
la agricultura todavia era la mayor fuente de trabajo esta posicion 
respecto a las tierras es mucho mas significante que cuando aparecio
inicialmente. En efecto, Tucker y otros Anarquistas Americanos abogaron
un **masivo** y **fundamental** cambio respecto a los derechos de propiedad,
en las relaciones sociales que generaron y en la sociedad Americana. Esto es,
en otras palabras, una muy *"fuerte restriccion"* en los derechos de propiedad
capitalista (y es **este** tipo de propiedad al que Caplan se refiere,
mas que a la "propiedad" en abstracto).

Sin embargo, tal "definicion" de socialismo como propiedad privada 
"restrictiva" es defectuoso ya que no solo no refleja realmente las ideas
anarquistas respecto al tema. Anarquistas, en efecto, rechazan al analisis
simplista que porque una sociedad (o pensador) acepta "propiedad" que esto
(o el/ella) sea capitalista. Esto es por dos razones. Primeramente, el 
termino "prpiedad" ha sido utilizado para describir un amplio rango de 
situaciones e instituciones. Por lo tanto Tucker utilizado al termino 
"propiedad" para describir una sociedad en la cual los derechos de propiedad
capistalistas **no** son forzados. Segundo, y por lejos mas importante,
al concentrarnos en derechos de "propiedad" de manera abstracta ignora 
las relaciones socialesq ue esto genera. La libertad es el producto
de interaccion social, no la isolacion. Esto significa que las relaciones
sociales generadas en una sociedad dada son la clave para evaluarla --
no sobre si tiene "propiedades" o no. Observar "propiedad" de forma
abstracta es ignorar a la gente y las relaciones que crea entre personas.
Y son estas relaciones las que determinan si son libres o no (y explotados
o no). El uso de Caplan de la "definicion" de los derecho de anti-propiedad
del socialismo evita el problema central de la libertad, de si dada una 
sociedad genera opresion y explotacion o no. Al observar a la "propiedad"
Caplan ignora libertad, una extrana pero no sorprendente posicion de un
auto-proclamado "libertario" para tomar.

Por lo tanto ambas "definiciones" de Caplan del socialismo estan incompletas.
Una *"tradicional"* de posesion gubernamental que dificilemente sea asi y
una basada en derecho de "propiedad" evitan la clave del problema mientras,
a su manera, incluye **todos** los anarquistas en el campo socialista (algo 
que, estamos seguros, Caplan no intento).

Entonces cual seria una definicion util de socialismo? Desde nuestra
discusion sobre la propiedad podemos instantaneamente rechazar los
puntos parciales y simplistas de Caplan. De hecho, una definicion de 
socialismo con la cual la mayoria de socialistas estarian de acuerdo 
seria aquella que declara que *"el total del producto de la labor debe
pertenecer a los trabajadores"* (utilizando las palabras de Thomas
Hodgskin, un socialista ingles de primera hora, **Labour Defended
against the Claims of Capital**). Tucked declaro que *"la demanda
final del Socialismo"* era que *"la labor debe ser puesta en posesion
de si mismo"*, que *"que el jornal natural de la labor es su producto"*
(ver su ensayo **State Socialism and Anarchism**). Esta definicion
tambien se encontro a favor con Kropotkin quien declaro que el socialismo 
*"en su amplio, generico, y verdadero sentido"* era un *"esfuerzo para 
**abolir** la explotacion del labor por el capital."* [**Kropotkin's 
Revolutionary Pamphlets**, p. 169]

Desde esta posicion, los socialistas pronto se dieron cuenta que (de 
nuevo para cigar a Kropotkin) *"la unica garantia para no ser robado
del fruto de tus productos es la posesion de los instrumentos para su
labor."* [**The Conquest of Bread**, p. 145] Porque de este socialismo
tambien puede ser definido como *"los trabajadores deben ser propietarios
de las recursos de produccion"*, por lo que esto automaticamente significa 
que el producto ira directamente al productor, y, de hecho, esto tambien
puede ser una definicion de socialismo con lo que la mayoria de socialistas
estarian de acuerdo. Esta forma de dominio, sin embargo, difiere de la
tendencia socialista (algunos, como Proudhon, propusieron asociasiones
co-operativas, otros como Kropotkin propiedad comunal, otros como los 
democratas sociales dominio estatal y asi). Por otro lado, como la 
economia cambio en el siglo 19, tambien lo hicieron las ideas socialistas.
Murray Bookchin da un buen sumario de este proceso:

> *"Th[e] growing shift from artisanal to an industrial economy gave
> rise to a gradual but major shift in socialism itself. For the
> artisan, socialism meant producers' co-operatives composed of men who
> worked together in small shared collectivist associations . . . For
> the industrial proletarian, by contrast, socialism came to mean the
> formation of a mass organisation that gave factory workers the
> collective power to expropriate a plant that no single worker could
> properly own. . . They advocated **public** ownership of the means of
> production, whether by the state or by the working class organised in
> trade unions."* [**The Third Revolution**, vol. 2, p. 262]

So, in this evolution of socialism we can place the various brands of
anarchism. Individualist anarchism is clearly a form of artisanal
socialism (which reflects its American roots) while communist anarchism
and anarcho-syndicalism are forms of industrial (or proletarian)
socialism (which reflects its roots in Europe). Proudhon's mutualism
bridges these extremes, advocating as it does artisan socialism for
small-scale industry and agriculture and co-operative associations for
large-scale industry (which reflects the state of the French economy in
the 1840s to 1860s). The common feature of all these forms of anarchism
is opposition to usury and the notion that *"workers shall own the means
of production."* Or, in Proudhon's words, *"abolition of the
proletariat."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 179] As one expert on Proudhon points
out, Proudhon's support for *"association"* (or *"associative
socialism"*) *"anticipated all those later movements"* which demanded
*"that the economy be controlled neither by private enterprise nor by
the state . . . but by the producers"* such as *"the revolutionary
syndicalists"* and *"the students of 1968."* [K. Steven Vincent,
**Pierre-Joseph Proudhon and the Rise of French Republican Socialism**,
p. 165] *"Industrial Democracy must. . . succeed Industrial Feudalism,"*
to again quote Proudhon. [**Op. Cit.**, p. 167]

Thus the common agreement between all socialists was that capitalism was
based upon exploitation and wage slavery, that workers did not have
access to the means of production and so had to sell themselves to the
class that did. Thus we find Individualist Anarchists arguing that the
whole produce of labour ought to belong to the labourer and opposing the
exploitation of labour by capital. To use Tucker's own words:

> *"the fact that one class of men are dependent for their living upon
> the sale of their labour, while another class of men are relieved of
> the necessity of labour by being legally privileged to sell something
> that is not labour. . . . And to such a state of things I am as much
> opposed as any one. But the minute you remove privilege . . . every
> man will be a labourer exchanging with fellow-labourers . . . What
> Anarchistic-Socialism aims to abolish is usury . . . it wants to
> deprive capital of its reward."* [**Instead of a Book**, p. 404]

By ending wage labour, anarchist socialism would ensure *"The land to
the cultivator. The mine to the miner. The tool to the labourer. The
product to the producer"* and so *"everyone [would] be a proprietor"*
and so there would be *"no more proletaires"* (in the words of Ernest
Lesigne, quoted favourably by Tucker as part of what he called a
*"summary exposition of Socialism from the standpoint of Anarchism"*
[**Op. Cit.**, p. 17, p. 16]). Wage labour, and so capitalism, would be
no more and *"the product [would go] to the producer."* The
Individualist Anarchists, as Wm. Gary Kline correctly points out,
*"expected a society of largely self-employed workmen with no
significant disparity of wealth between any of them."* [**The
Individualist Anarchists**, p. 104] In other words, the *"abolition of
the proletariat"* as desired by Proudhon.

Therefore, like all socialists, Tucker wanted to end usury, ensure the
*"product to the producer"* and this meant workers owning and
controlling the means of production they used (*"no more proletaires"*).
He aimed to do this by reforming capitalism away by creating mutual
banks and other co-operatives (he notes that Individualist Anarchists
followed Proudhon, who *"would individualise and associate"* the
productive and distributive forces in society [as quoted by James J.
Martin, **Men Against the State**, p. 228]). Here is Kropotkin on
Proudhon's reformist mutualist-socialism:

> *"When he proclaimed in his first memoir on property that 'Property is
> theft', he meant only property in its present, Roman-law, sense of
> 'right of use and abuse'; in property-rights, on the other hand,
> understood in the limited sense of **possession**, he saw the best
> protection against the encroachments of the state. At the same time he
> did not want violently to dispossess the present owners of land,
> dwelling-houses, mines, factories and so on. He preferred to **attain
> the same end** by rendering capital incapable of earning interest."*
> [**Kropotkin's Revolutionary Pamphlet's**, pp. 290-1 -- emphasis
> added]

In other words, like all anarchists, Proudhon desired to see a society
without capitalists and wage slaves (*"the same end"*) but achieved by
different means. When Proudhon wrote to Karl Marx in 1846 he made the
same point:

> *"through Political Economy we must turn the theory of Property
> against Property in such a way as to create what you German socialists
> call **community** and which for the moment I will only go so far as
> calling **liberty** or **equality.**"* [**Selected Writings of
> Pierre-Joseph Proudhon**, p. 151]

In other words, Proudhon shared the common aim of all socialists (namely
to abolish capitalism, wage labour and exploitation) but disagreed with
the means. As can be seen, Tucker placed himself squarely in this
tradition and so could (and did) call himself a socialist. Little wonder
Joseph Labadie often said that *"All anarchists are socialists, but not
all socialists are anarchists."* That Caplan tries to ignore this aspect
of Individualist Anarchism in an attempt to co-opt it into
"anarcho"-capitalism indicates well that his FAQ is not an objective or
neutral work.

Caplan states that the *"United States has been an even more fertile
ground for individualist anarchism: during the 19th-century, such
figures as Josiah Warren, Lysander Spooner, and Benjamin Tucker gained
prominence for their vision of an anarchism based upon freedom of
contract and private property."*

However, as indicated, Tucker and Spooner did **not** support private
property in the capitalist sense of the word and Kropotkin and Bakunin,
no less than Tucker and Spooner, supported free agreement between
individuals and groups. What does that prove? That Caplan seems more
interested in the words Tucker and Proudhon used rather than the
meanings **they** attached to them. Hardly convincing.

Perhaps Caplan should consider Proudhon's words on the subject of
socialism:

> *"Modern Socialism was not founded as a sect or church; it has seen a
> number of different schools."* [**Selected Writings of Pierre-Joseph
> Proudhon**, p. 177]

If he did perhaps he would who see that the Individualist Anarchists
were a school of socialism, given their opposition to exploitation and
the desire to see its end via their political, economic and social
ideas.

3 - Was Proudhon a socialist or a capitalist?
---------------------------------------------

In section 8 (Who are the major anarchist thinkers?), Caplan tries his
best to claim that Proudhon was not really a socialist at all. He states
that *"Pierre[-Joseph] Proudhon is also often included [as a "left
anarchist"] although his ideas on the desirability of a modified form of
private property would lead some to exclude him from the leftist camp
altogether."*

"Some" of which group? Other anarchists, like Bakunin and Kropotkin?
Obviously not -- Bakunin claimed that *"Proudhon was the master of us
all."* According to George Woodcock Kropotkin was one of Proudhon's
*"confessed disciples."* Perhaps that makes Bakunin and Kropotkin
proto-capitalists? Obviously not. What about Tucker? He called Proudhon
*"the father of the Anarchistic school of Socialism."* [**Instead of a
Book**, p. 381] And, as we noted above, the socialist historian Carl
Launder considered Proudhon a socialist, as did the noted British
socialist G.D.H. Cole in his **History of Socialist Thought** (and in
fact called him one of the *"major prophets of Socialism."*). What about
Marx and Engels, surely they would be able to say if he was a socialist
or not? According to Engels, Proudhon was *"the Socialist of the small
peasant and master-craftsman."* [Marx and Engels, **Selected Works**, p.
260]

In fact, the only "left" (i.e. social) anarchist of note who seems to
place Proudhon outside of the "leftist" (i.e. anarchist) camp is Murray
Bookchin. In the second volume of **The Third Revolution** Bookchin
argues that *"Proudhon was no socialist"* simply because he favoured
*"private property."* [p. 39] However, he does note the *"one moral
provision [that] distinguished the Proudhonist contract from the
capitalist contract"* namely *"it abjured profit and exploitation."*
[**Op. Cit.**, pp. 40-41] -- which, of course, places him in the
socialist tradition (see [last section](append11.html#app2)).
Unfortunately, Bookchin fails to acknowledge this or that Proudhon was
totally opposed to wage labour along with usury, which, again, instantly
places him in ranks of socialism (see, for example, the **General Idea
of the Revolution**, p. 98, pp. 215-6 and pp. 221-2, and his opposition
to state control of capital as being *"more wage slavery"* and, instead,
urging whatever capital required collective labour to be
*"democratically organised workers' associations"* [**No Gods, No
Masters**, vol. 1, p. 62]).

Bookchin (on page 78) quotes Proudhon as arguing that *"association"*
was *"a protest against the wage system"* which suggests that Bookchin's
claims that Proudhonian *"analysis minimised the social relations
embodied in the capitalist market and industry"* [p. 180] is false.
Given that wage labour is **the** unique social relationship within
capitalism, it is clear from Proudhon's works that he did not "minimise"
the social relations created by capitalism, rather the opposite.
Proudhon's opposition to wage labour clearly shows that he focused on
the **key** social relation which capitalism creates -- namely the one
of domination of the worker by the capitalist.

Bookchin **does** mention that Proudhon was *"obliged in 1851, in the
wake of the associationist ferment of 1848 and after, to acknowledge
that association of some sort was unavoidable for large-scale
enterprises."* [p. 78] However, Proudhon's support of industrial
democracy pre-dates 1851 by some 11 years. He stated in **What is
Property?** that he *"preach[ed] emancipation to the proletaires;
association to the labourers"* and that *"leaders"* within industry
*"must be chosen from the labourers by the labourers themselves."* [p.
137 and p. 414] It is significant that the first work to call itself
anarchist opposed property along with the state, exploitation along with
oppression and supported self-management against hierarchical
relationships within production ("anarcho"-capitalists take note!).
Proudhon also called for *"democratically organised workers'
associations"* to run large-scale industry in his 1848 Election
Manifesto. [**No Gods, No Masters**, vol. 1, p. 62] Given that Bookchin
considers as *"authentic artisanal socialists"* those who called for
**collective** ownership of the means of production, but *"exempted from
collectivisation the peasantry"* [p. 4] we have to conclude that
Proudhon was such an "authentic" artisanal socialist! Indeed, at one
point Bookchin mentions the *"individualistic artisanal socialism of
Proudhon"* [p. 258] which suggests a somewhat confused approach to
Proudhon's ideas!

In effect, Bookchin makes the same mistake as Caplan; but, unlike
Caplan, he should know better. Rather than not being a socialist,
Proudhon is obviously an example of what Bookchin himself calls
*"artisanal socialism"* (as Marx and Engels recongised). Indeed, he
notes that Proudhon was its *"most famous advocate"* and that *"nearly
all so-called 'utopian' socialists, even [Robert] Owen -- the most
labour-orientated -- as well as Proudhon -- essentially sought the
equitable distribution of property."* [p. 273] Given Proudhon's
opposition to wage labour and capitalist property and his support for
industrial democracy as an alternative, Bookchin's position is untenable
-- he confuses socialism with communism, rejecting as socialist all
views which are not communism (a position he shares with
right-libertarians).

He did not always hold this position, though. He writes in **The Spanish
Anarchists** that:

> *"Proudhon envisions a free society as one in which small craftsmen,
> peasants, and collectively owned industrial enterprises negotiate and
> contract with each other to satisfy their material needs. Exploitation
> is brought to an end. . . Although these views involve a break with
> capitalism, by no means can they be regarded as communist ideas. . ."*
> [p. 18]

In contrast to some of Bookchin's comments (and Caplan) K. Steven
Vincent is correct to argue that, for Proudhon, justice *"applied to the
economy was associative socialism"* and so Proudhon is squarely in the
socialist camp [**Pierre-Joseph Proudhon and the Rise of French
Republican Socialism**, p. 228].

However, perhaps all these "leftists" are wrong (bar Bookchin, who
**is** wrong, at least some of the time). Perhaps they just did not
understand what socialism actually is (and as Proudhon stated *"I am
socialist"* [**Selected Writing of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon**, p. 195] and
described himself as a socialist many times this also applies to
Proudhon himself!). So the question arises, did Proudhon support private
property in the capitalist sense of the word? The answer is no. To quote
George Woodcock summary of Proudhon's ideas on this subject we find:

> *"He [Proudhon] was denouncing the property of a man who uses it to
> exploit the labour of others, without an effort on his own part,
> property distinguished by interest and rent, by the impositions of the
> non-producer on the producer. Towards property regarded as
> 'possession,' the right of a man to control his dwelling and the land
> and tools he needs to live, Proudhon had no hostility; indeed he
> regarded it as the cornerstone of liberty."* [*"On Proudhon's 'What is
> Property?'"*, **The Raven** No. 31, pp. 208-9]

George Crowder makes the same point:

> *"The ownership he opposes is basically that which is unearned . . .
> including such things as interest on loans and income from rent. This
> is contrasted with ownership rights in those goods either produced by
> the work of the owner or necessary for that work, for example his
> dwelling-house, land and tools. Proudhon initially refers to
> legitimate rights of ownership of these goods as 'possession,' and
> although in his latter work he calls **this** 'property,' the
> conceptual distinction remains the same."* [**Classical Anarchism**,
> pp. 85-86]

Indeed, according to Proudhon himself, the *"accumulation of capital and
instrument is what the capitalist owes to the producer, but he never
pays him for it. It is this fraudulent deprivation which causes the
poverty of the worker, the opulence of the idle and the inequality of
their conditions. And it is this, above all, which has so aptly been
called the exploitation of man by man."* [**Selected Writings of
Pierre-Joseph Proudhon**, p. 43]

He called his ideas on possession a *"third form of society, the
synthesis of communism and property"* and calls it *"liberty."* [**The
Anarchist Reader**, p. 68]. He even goes so far as to say that property
*"by its despotism and encroachment, soon proves itself oppressive and
anti-social."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 67] Opposing private property he
thought that *"all accumulated capital is collective property, no one
may be its exclusive owner."* Indeed, he considered the aim of his
economic reforms *"was to rescue the working masses from capitalist
exploitation."* [**Selected Writings of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon**, p. 44,
p. 80]

In other words, Proudhon considered capitalist property to be the source
of exploitation and oppression and he opposed it. He explicitly
contrasts his ideas to that of capitalist property and **rejects** it as
a means of ensuring liberty.

Caplan goes on to claim that *"[s]ome of Proudhon's other heterodoxies
include his defence of the right of inheritance and his emphasis on the
genuine antagonism between state power and property rights."*

However, this is a common anarchist position. Anarchists are well aware
that possession is a source of independence within capitalism and so
should be supported. As Albert Meltzer puts it:

> *"All present systems of ownership mean that some are deprived of the
> fruits of their labour. It is true that, in a competitive society,
> only the possession of independent means enables one to be free of the
> economy (that is what Proudhon meant when, addressing himself to the
> self-employed artisan, he said 'property is liberty', which seems at
> first sight a contradiction with his dictum that it was
> theft)"*[**Anarchism: Arguments For and Against**, pp. 12-13]

Malatesta makes the same point:

> *"Our opponents . . . are in the habit of justifying the right to
> private property by stating that property is the condition and
> guarantee of liberty.*
>
> "And we agree with them. Do we not say repeatedly that poverty is
> slavery?
>
> "But then why do we oppose them?
>
> "The reason is clear: in reality the property that they defend is
> capitalist property. . . which therefore depends on the existence of a
> class of the disinherited and dispossessed, forced to sell their
> labour to the property owners for a wage below its real value. . .
> This means that workers are subjected to a kind of slavery." [**The
> Anarchist Revolution**, p. 113]

As does Kropotkin:

> *"the only guarantee not to be robbed of the fruits of your labour is
> to possess the instruments of labour. . . man really produces most
> when he works in freedom, when he has a certain choice in his
> occupations, when he has no overseer to impede him, and lastly, when
> he sees his work bringing profit to him and to others who work like
> him, but bringing in little to idlers."* [**The Conquest of Bread**,
> p. 145]

Perhaps this makes these three well known anarcho-communists "really"
proto-"anarcho"-capitalists as well? Obviously not. Instead of wondering
if his ideas on what socialism is are wrong, he tries to rewrite history
to fit the anarchist movement into his capitalist ideas of what
anarchism, socialism and whatever are actually like.

In addition, we must point out that Proudhon's *"emphasis on the genuine
antagonism between state power and property rights"* came from his later
writings, in which he argued that property rights were required to
control state power. In other words, this *"heterodoxy"* came from a
period in which Proudhon did not think that state could be abolished and
so *"property is the only power that can act as a counterweight to the
State."* [**Selected Writings of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon**, p. 140] Of
course, this "later" Proudhon also acknowledged that property was *"an
absolutism within an absolutism,"* *"by nature autocratic"* and that its
*"politics could be summed up in a single word,"* namely
*"exploitation."* [p. 141, p. 140, p. 134]

Moreover, Proudhon argues that *"spread[ing] it more equally and
establish[ing] it more firmly in society"* is the means by which
"property" *"becomes a guarantee of liberty and keeps the State on an
even keel."* [p. 133, p. 140] In other words, rather than "property"
**as such** limiting the state, it is "property" divided equally through
society which is the key, without concentrations of economic power and
inequality which would result in exploitation and oppression. Therefore,
*"[s]imple justice. . . requires that equal division of land shall not
only operate at the outset. If there is to be no abuse, it must be
maintained from generation to generation."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 141, p.
133, p. 130].

Interestingly, one of Proudhon's *"other heterodoxies"* Caplan does not
mention is his belief that "property" was required not only to defend
people against the state, but also capitalism. He saw society dividing
into *"two classes, one of employed workers, the other of
property-owners, capitalists, entrepreneurs."* He thus recognised that
capitalism was just as oppressive as the state and that it assured *"the
victory of the strong over the weak, of those who property over those
who own nothing."* [as quoted by Alan Ritter, **The Political Thought of
Pierre-Joseph Proudhon**, p. 121] Thus Proudhon's argument that
*"property is liberty"* is directed not only against the state, but also
against social inequality and concentrations of economic power and
wealth.

Indeed, he considered that *"companies of capitalists"* were the
*"exploiters of the bodies and souls of their wage earners"* and an
outrage on *"human dignity and personality."* Instead of wage labour he
thought that the *"industry to be operated, the work to be done, are the
common and indivisible property of all the participant workers."* In
other words, self-management and workers' control. In this way there
would be *"no more government of man by man, by means of accumulation of
capital"* and the *"social republic"* established. Hence his support for
co-operatives:

> *"The importance of their work lies not in their petty union
> interests, but in their denial of the rule of capitalists, usurers,
> and governments, which the first [French] revolution left undisturbed.
> Afterwards, when they have conquered the political lie. . . the groups
> of workers should take over the great departments of industry which
> are their natural inheritance."* [cited in **Pierre-Joseph Proudhon**,
> E. Hymans, pp. 190-1, and **Anarchism**, George Woodcock, p. 110, 112]

In other words, a **socialist** society as workers would no longer be
separated from the means of production and they would control their own
work (the *"abolition of the proletariat,"* to use Proudhon's
expression). This would mean recognising that *"the right to products is
exclusive - jus in re; the right to means is common - jus ad rem"*
[cited by Woodcock, **Anarchism**, p. 96] which would lead to
self-management:

> *"In democratising us, revolution has launched us on the path of
> industrial democracy."* [**Selected Writings of Pierre-Joseph
> Proudhon**, p. 63]

As Woodcock points out, in Proudhon's *"picture of the ideal society of
the ideal society it is this predominance of the small proprietor, the
peasant or artisan, that immediately impresses one"* with *"the creation
of co-operative associations for the running of factories and
railways."* [*"On Proudhon's 'What is Property?'"*, **Op. Cit.**, p.
209, p. 210]

All of which hardly supports Caplan's attempts to portray Proudhon as
"really" a capitalist all along. Indeed, the "later" Proudhon's support
for protectionism [**Selected Writings of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon**, p.
187], the *"fixing after amicable discussion of a **maximum** and
**minimum** profit margin,"* *"the organising of regulating societies"*
and that mutualism would *"regulate the market"* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 70]
and his obvious awareness of economic power and that capitalism
exploited and oppressed the wage-worker suggests that rather than
leading some to exclude Proudhon from the "leftist camp" altogether, it
is a case of excluding him utterly from the "rightist camp" (i.e.
"anarcho"-capitalism). Therefore Caplan's attempt to claim (co-opt would
be better) Proudhon for "anarcho"-capitalism indicates how far Caplan
will twist (or ignore) the evidence. As would quickly become obvious
when reading his work, Proudhon would (to use Caplan's words) *"normally
classify government, property, hierarchical organisations . . . as
'rulership.'"*

To summarise, Proudhon was a socialist and Caplan's attempts to rewrite
anarchist and socialist history fails. Proudhon was the fountainhead for
both wings of the anarchist movement and **What is Property?**
*"embraces the core of nineteenth century anarchism. . . [bar support
for revolution] all the rest of later anarchism is there, spoken or
implied: the conception of a free society united by association, of
workers controlling the means of production. . . [this book] remains the
foundation on which the whole edifice of nineteenth century anarchist
theory was to be constructed."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 210]

Little wonder Bakunin stated that his ideas were Proudhonism *"widely
developed and pushed to these, its final consequences."* [**Michael
Bakunin: Selected Writings**, p. 198]

4 - Tucker on Property, Communism and Socialism.
------------------------------------------------

That Tucker called himself a socialist is quickly seen from **Instead of
A Book** or any of the books written about Tucker and his ideas. That
Caplan seeks to deny this means that either Caplan has not looked at
either **Instead of a Book** or the secondary literature (with obvious
implications for the accuracy of his FAQ) or he decided to ignore these
facts in favour of his own ideologically tainted version of history
(again with obvious implications for the accuracy and objectivity of his
FAQ).

Caplan, in an attempt to deny the obvious, quotes Tucker from 1887 as
follows in section 14 (What are the major debates between anarchists?
What are the recurring arguments?):

> *"It will probably surprise many who know nothing of Proudhon save his
> declaration that 'property is robbery' to learn that he was perhaps
> the most vigorous hater of Communism that ever lived on this planet.
> But the apparent inconsistency vanishes when you read his book and
> find that by property he means simply legally privileged wealth or the
> power of usury, and not at all the possession by the labourer of his
> products."*

You will instantly notice that Proudhon does not mean by property *"the
possession of the labourer of his products."* However, Proudhon did
include in his definition of "property" the possession of the capital to
steal profits from the work of the labourers. As is clear from the
quote, Tucker and Proudhon was opposed to capitalist property (*"the
power of usury"*). From Caplan's own evidence he proves that Tucker was
not a capitalist!

But lets quote Tucker on what he meant by *"usury"*:

> *"There are three forms of usury, interest on money, rent on land and
> houses, and profit in exchange. Whoever is in receipt of any of these
> is a usurer."* [cited in **Men against the State** by James J. Martin,
> p. 208]

Which can hardly be claimed as being the words of a person who supports
capitalism!

And we should note that Tucker considered both government and capital
oppressive. He argued that anarchism meant *"the restriction of power to
self and the abolition of power over others. Government makes itself
felt alike in country and in city, capital has its usurious grip on the
farm as surely as on the workshop and the oppressions and exactions of
neither government nor capital can be avoided by migration."* [**Instead
of a Book**, p. 114]

And, we may add, since when was socialism identical to communism?
Perhaps Caplan should actually read Proudhon and the anarchist critique
of private property before writing such nonsense? We have indicated
Proudhon's ideas above and will not repeat ourselves. However, it is
interesting that this passes as "evidence" of "anti-socialism" for
Caplan, indicating that he does not know what socialism or anarchism
actually is. To state the obvious, you can be a hater of "communism" and
still be a socialist!

So this, his one attempt to prove that Tucker, Spooner and even Proudhon
were really capitalists by quoting the actual people involved is a
failure.

He asserts that for any claim that "anarcho"-capitalism is not anarchist
is wrong because *"the factual supporting arguments are often incorrect.
For example, despite a popular claim that socialism and anarchism have
been inextricably linked since the inception of the anarchist movement,
many 19th-century anarchists, not only Americans such as Tucker and
Spooner, but even Europeans like Proudhon, were ardently in favour of
private property (merely believing that some existing sorts of property
were illegitimate, without opposing private property as such)."*

The facts supporting the claim of anarchists being socialists, however,
are not "incorrect." It is Caplan's assumption that socialism is against
all forms of "property" which is wrong. To state the obvious, socialism
does not equal communism (and anarcho-communists support the rights of
workers to own their own means of production if they do not wish to join
communist communes -- see above). Thus Proudhon was renown as the
leading French Socialist theorist when he was alive. His ideas were
widely known in the socialist movement and in many ways his economic
theories were similar to the ideas of such well known early socialists
as Robert Owen and William Thompson. As Kropotkin notes:

> *"It is worth noticing that French mutualism had its precursor in
> England, in William Thompson, who began by mutualism before he became
> a communist, and in his followers John Gray (A Lecture on Human
> Happiness, 1825; The Social System, 1831) and J. F. Bray (Labour's
> Wrongs and Labour's Remedy, 1839)."* [**Kropotkin's Revolutionary
> Pamphlets**, p. 291]

Perhaps Caplan will now claim Robert Owen and William Thompson as
capitalists?

Tucker called himself a socialist on many different occasions and stated
that there were *"two schools of Socialistic thought . . . State
Socialism and Anarchism."* And stated in very clear terms that:

> *"liberty insists on Socialism. . . - true Socialism, Anarchistic
> Socialism: the prevalence on earth of Liberty, Equality, and
> Solidarity."* [**Instead of a Book**, p. 363]

And like all socialists, he opposed capitalism (i.e. usury and wage
slavery) and wished that *"there should be no more proletaires."* [see
the essay *"State Socialism and Anarchism"* in **Instead of a Book**, p.
17]

Caplan, of course, is well aware of Tucker's opinions on the subject of
capitalism and private property. In section 13 (What moral
justifications have been offered for anarchism?) he writes:

> *"Still other anarchists, such as Lysander Spooner and Benjamin Tucker
> as well as Proudhon, have argued that anarchism would abolish the
> exploitation inherent in interest and rent simply by means of free
> competition. In their view, only labour income is legitimate, and an
> important piece of the case for anarchism is that without
> government-imposed monopolies, non-labour income would be driven to
> zero by market forces. It is unclear, however, if they regard this as
> merely a desirable side effect, or if they would reject anarchism if
> they learned that the predicted economic effect thereof would not
> actually occur."*

Firstly, we must point that Proudhon, Tucker and Spooner considered
**profits** to be exploitative as well as interest and rent. Hence we
find Tucker arguing that a *"just distribution of the products of labour
is to be obtained by destroying all sources of income except labour.
These sources may be summed up in one word, -- usury; and the three
principle forms of usury are interest, rent and profit."* [**Instead of
a Book**, p. 474] To ignore the fact that Tucker also considered profit
as exploitative seems strange, to say the least, when presenting an
account of his ideas.

Secondly, rather than it being *"unclear"* whether the end of usury was
*"merely a desirable side effect"* of anarchism, the opposite is the
case. Anyone reading Tucker (or Proudhon) would quickly see that their
politics were formulated with the express aim of ending usury. Just one
example from hundreds:

> *"Liberty will abolish interest; it will abolish profit; it will
> abolish monopolistic rent; it will abolish taxation; it will abolish
> the exploitation of labour; it will abolish all means whereby any
> labourer can be deprived of any of his product."* [**Instead of a
> Book**, p. 347]

While it is fair to wonder whether these economic effects would result
from the application of Tucker's ideas, it **is** distinctly incorrect
to claim that the end of usury was considered in any way as a
*"desirable side effect"* of them. Rather, in **their** eyes, the end of
usury was one of **the** aims of Individualist Anarchism, as can be
clearly seen. As Wm. Gary Kline points out in his excellent account of
Individualist Anarchism:

> *"the American anarchists exposed the tension existing in liberal
> thought between private property and the ideal of equal access. The
> Individualist Anarchists were, at least, aware that existing
> conditions were far from ideal, that the system itself worked against
> the majority of individuals in their efforts to attain its promises.
> Lack of capital, the means to creation and accumulation of wealth,
> usually doomed a labourer to a life of exploitation. This the
> anarchists knew and they abhorred such a system."* [**The
> Individualist Anarchists**, p. 102]

This is part of the reason why they considered themselves socialists
and, equally as important, they were considered socialists by **other**
socialists such as Kropotkin and Rocker. The Individualist Anarchists,
as can be seen, fit very easily into Kropotkin's comments that *"the
anarchists, in common with all socialists. . . maintain that the now
prevailing system of private ownership in land, and our capitalist
production for the sake of profits, represent a monopoly which runs
against both the principles of justice and the dictates of utility."*
[**Kropotkin's Revolutionary Pamphlets**, p. 285] Given that they
considered profits as usury and proposed *"occupancy and use"* in place
of the prevailing land ownership rights they are obviously socialists.

That the end of usury was considered a clear aim of his politics
explains Tucker's 1911 postscript to his famous essay *"State Socialism
and Anarchism"* in which he argues that *"concentrated capital"*
**itself** was a barrier towards anarchy. He argued that the *"trust is
now a monster which. . . even the freest competition, could it be
instituted, would be unable to destroy."* While, in an earlier period,
big business *"needed the money monopoly for its sustenance and its
growth"* its size now ensured that it *"sees in the money monopoly a
convenience, to be sure, but no longer a necessity. It can do without
it."* This meant that the way was now *"not so clear."* Indeed, he
argued that the problem of the trusts *"must be grappled with for a time
solely by forces political or revolutionary"* as the trust had moved
beyond the reach of *"economic forces"* simply due to the concentration
of resources in its hands. [*"Postscript"* to **State Socialism and
Anarchism**]

If the end of *"usury"* **was** considered a *"side-effect"* rather than
an objective, then the problems of the trusts and economic
inequality/power (*"enormous concentration of wealth"*) would not have
been an issue. That the fact of economic power **was** obviously
considered a hindrance to anarchy suggests the end of usury was a key
aim, an aim which "free competition" in the abstract could not achieve.
Rather than take the "anarcho"-capitalist position that massive
inequality did not affect "free competition" or individual liberty,
Tucker obviously thought it did and, therefore, "free competition" (and
so the abolition of the public state) in conditions of massive
inequality would not create an anarchist society.

By trying to relegate an aim to a *"side-effect,"* Caplan distorts the
ideas of Tucker. Indeed, his comments on trusts, *"concentrated
capital"* and the *"enormous concentration of wealth"* indicates how far
Individualist Anarchism is from "anarcho"-capitalism (which dismisses
the question of economic power Tucker raises out of hand). It also
indicates the unity of political and economic ideas, with Tucker being
aware that without a suitable economic basis individual freedom was
meaningless. That an economy (like capitalism) with massive inequalities
in wealth and so power was not such a basis is obvious from Tucker's
comments.

Thirdly, what did Tucker consider as a government-imposed monopoly?
Private property, particularly in land! As he states *"Anarchism
undertakes to protect no titles except such as are based upon actual
occupancy and use"* and that anarchism *"means the abolition of
landlordism and the annihilation of rent."* [**Instead of a Book**, p.
61, p. 300] This, to state the obvious, is a restriction on "private
property" (in the capitalist sense), which, if we use Caplan's
definition of socialism, means that Tucker was obviously part of the
"Leftist camp" (i.e. socialist camp). In other words, Tucker considered
capitalism as the product of statism while socialism (libertarian of
course) would be the product of anarchy.

So, Caplan's historical argument to support his notion that anarchism is
simply anti-government fails. Anarchism, in all its many forms, have
distinct economic as well as political ideas and these cannot be parted
without loosing what makes anarchism unique. In particular, Caplan's
attempt to portray Proudhon as an example of a "pure" anti-government
anarchism also fails, and so his attempt to co-opt Tucker and Spooner
also fails (as noted, Tucker cannot be classed as a "pure"
anti-government anarchist either). If Proudhon was a socialist, then it
follows that his self-proclaimed followers will also be socialists --
and, unsurprisingly, Tucker called himself a socialist and considered
anarchism as part of the wider socialist movement.

5 - Anarchism and "anarcho"-capitalism
--------------------------------------

Caplan tries to build upon the non-existent foundation of Tucker's and
Proudhon's "capitalism" by stating that:

> *"Nor did an ardent anarcho-communist like Kropotkin deny Proudhon or
> even Tucker the title of 'anarchist.' In his Modern Science and
> Anarchism, Kropotkin discusses not only Proudhon but 'the American
> anarchist individualists who were represented in the fifties by S.P.
> Andrews and W. Greene, later on by Lysander Spooner, and now are
> represented by Benjamin Tucker, the well-known editor of the New York
> Liberty.' Similarly in his article on anarchism for the 1910 edition
> of the Encyclopedia Britannica, Kropotkin again freely mentions the
> American individualist anarchists, including 'Benjamin Tucker, whose
> journal Liberty was started in 1881 and whose conceptions are a
> combination of those of Proudhon with those of Herbert Spencer.'"*

There is a nice historical irony in Caplan's attempts to use Kropotkin
to prove the historical validity of "anarcho"-capitalism. This is
because while Kropotkin was happy to include Tucker into the anarchist
movement, Tucker often claimed that an anarchist could not be a
communist! In **State Socialism and Anarchism** he stated that anarchism
was *"an ideal utterly inconsistent with that of those Communists who
falsely call themselves Anarchists while at the same time advocating a
regime of Archism fully as despotic as that of the State Socialists
themselves."* [*"State Socialism and Anarchism"*, **Instead of a Book**,
pp. 15-16]

While modern social anarchists follow Kropotkin in not denying Proudhon
or Tucker as anarchists, we do deny the anarchist title to supporters of
capitalism. Why? Simply because anarchism as a **political** movement
(as opposed to a dictionary definition) has always been anti-capitalist
and against capitalist wage slavery, exploitation and oppression. In
other words, anarchism (in all its forms) has always been associated
with specific political **and** economic ideas. Both Tucker and
Kropotkin defined their anarchism as an opposition to both state and
capitalism. To quote Tucker on the subject:

> *"Liberty insists. . . [on] the abolition of the State and the
> abolition of usury; on no more government of man by man, and no more
> exploitation of man by man."* [cited in **Native American Anarchism -
> A Study of Left-Wing American Individualism** by Eunice Schuster, p.
> 140]

Kropotkin defined anarchism as *"the no-government system of
socialism."* [**Kropotkin's Revolutionary Pamphlets**, p. 46] Malatesta
argued that *"when [people] sought to overthrow both State and property
-- then it was anarchy was born"* and, like Tucker, aimed for *"the
complete destruction of the domination and exploitation of man by man."*
[**Life and Ideas**, p. 19, pp. 22-28] Indeed **every** leading
anarchist theorist defined anarchism as opposition to government **and**
exploitation. Thus Brain Morris' excellent summary:

> *"Another criticism of anarchism is that it has a narrow view of
> politics: that it sees the state as the fount of all evil, ignoring
> other aspects of social and economic life. This is a misrepresentation
> of anarchism. It partly derives from the way anarchism has been
> defined [in dictionaries, for example], and partly because Marxist
> historians have tried to exclude anarchism from the broader socialist
> movement. But when one examines the writings of classical anarchists.
> . . as well as the character of anarchist movements. . . it is clearly
> evident that it has never had this limited vision. It has always
> challenged all forms of authority and exploitation, and has been
> equally critical of capitalism and religion as it has been of the
> state."* [*"Anthropology and Anarchism,"* **Anarchy: A Journal of
> Desire Armed** no. 45, p. 40]

Therefore anarchism was never purely a political concept, but always
combined an opposition to oppression with an opposition to exploitation.
Little wonder, then, that both strands of anarchism have declared
themselves "socialist" and so it is *"conceptually and historically
misleading"* to *"create a dichotomy between socialism and anarchism."*
[Brian Morris, **Op. Cit.**, p. 39] Needless to say, anarchists oppose
**state** socialism just as much as they oppose capitalism. All of which
means that anarchism and capitalism are two **different** political
ideas with specific (and opposed) meanings -- to deny these meanings by
uniting the two terms creates an oxymoron, one that denies the history
and the development of ideas as well as the whole history of the
anarchist movement itself.

As Kropotkin knew Proudhon to be an anti-capitalist, a socialist (but
not a communist) it is hardly surprising that he mentions him. Again,
Caplan's attempt to provide historical evidence for a "right-wing"
anarchism fails. Funny that the followers of Kropotkin are now defending
individualist anarchism from the attempted "adoption" by supporters of
capitalism! That in itself should be enough to indicate Caplan's attempt
to use Kropotkin to give credence to "anarcho"-capitalist co-option of
Proudhon, Tucker and Spooner fails.

Interestingly, Caplan admits that "anarcho"-capitalism has recent
origins. In section 8 (Who are the major anarchist thinkers?) he states:

> *"Anarcho-capitalism has a much more recent origin in the latter half
> of the 20th century. The two most famous advocates of
> anarcho-capitalism are probably Murray Rothbard and David Friedman.
> There were however some interesting earlier precursors, notably the
> Belgian economist Gustave de Molinari. Two other 19th-century
> anarchists who have been adopted by modern anarcho-capitalists with a
> few caveats are Benjamin Tucker and Lysander Spooner. (Some
> left-anarchists contest the adoption, but overall Tucker and Spooner
> probably have much more in common with anarcho-capitalists than with
> left-anarchists.)"*

Firstly, as he states, Tucker and Spooner have been *"adopted"* by the
"anarcho"-capitalist school. Being dead they have little chance to
protest such an adoption, but it is clear that they considered
themselves as socialists, against capitalism (it may be claimed that
Spooner never called himself a socialist, but then again he never called
himself an anarchist either; it is his strong opposition to wage labour
that places him in the socialist camp). Secondly, Caplan lets the cat
out the bag by noting that this "adoption" involved a few warnings -
more specifically, the attempt to rubbish or ignore the underlying
socio-economic ideas of Tucker and Spooner and the obvious
anti-capitalist nature of their vision of a free society.

Individualist anarchists are, indeed, more similar to classical liberals
than social anarchists. Similarly, social anarchists are more similar to
Marxists than Individualist anarchists. But neither statement means that
Individualist anarchists are capitalists, or social anarchists are state
socialists. It just means some of their ideas overlap -- and we must
point out that Individualist anarchist ideas overlap with Marxist ones,
and social anarchist ones with liberal ones (indeed, one interesting
overlap between Marxism and Individualist Anarchism can be seen from
Marx's comment that abolishing interest and interest-bearing capital
*"means the abolition of capital and of capitalist production itself."*
[**Theories of Surplus Value**, vol. 3, p. 472] Given that Individualist
Anarchism aimed to abolish interest (along with rent and profit) it
would suggest, from a Marxist position, that it is a socialist theory).

So, if we accept Kropotkin's summary that Individualist Anarchism ideas
are *"partly those of Proudhon, but party those of Herbert Spencer"*
[**Kropotkins' Revolutionary Pamphlets**, p. 173], what the
"anarcho"-capitalist school is trying to is to ignore the Proudhonian
(i.e. socialist) aspect of their theories. However, that just leaves
Spencer and Spencer was not an anarchist, but a right-wing Libertarian,
a supporter of capitalism (a *"champion of the capitalistic class"* as
Tucker put it). In other words, to ignore the socialist aspect of
Individualist Anarchism (or anarchism in general) is to reduce it to
liberalism, an extreme version of liberalism, but liberalism
nevertheless -- and liberalism is not anarchism. To reduce anarchism so
is to destroy what makes anarchism a unique political theory and
movement:

> *"anarchism does derive from liberalism and socialism both
> historically and ideologically . . . In a sense, anarchists always
> remain liberals and socialists, and whenever they reject what is good
> in either they betray anarchism itself . . . We are liberals but more
> so, and socialists but more so."* [Nicholas Walter, **Reinventing
> Anarchy**, p. 44]

In other words, "anarcho"-capitalism is a development of ideas which
have little in common with anarchism. Jeremy Jennings, in his overview
of anarchist theory and history, agrees:

> *"It is hard not to conclude that these ideas ["anarcho"-capitalism]
> -- with roots deep in classical liberalism -- are described as
> anarchist only on the basis of a misunderstanding of what anarchism
> is."* [**Contemporary Political Ideologies**, Roger Eatwell and
> Anthony Wright (eds.), p. 142]

Barbara Goodwin also agrees that the "anarcho"-capitalists' *"true place
is in the group of right-wing libertarians"* not in anarchism [**Using
Political Ideas**, p. 148]. Indeed, that "anarcho"-capitalism is an
off-shoot of classical liberalism is a position Murray Rothbard would
agree with, as he states that right-wing Libertarians constitute *"the
vanguard of classical liberalism."* [quoted by Ulrike Heider,
**Anarchism: Left, Right and Green**, p. 95] Unfortunately for this
perspective anarchism is not liberalism and liberalism is not anarchism.
And equally as unfortunate (this time for the anarchist movement!)
"anarcho"-capitalism *"is judged to be anarchism largely because some
anarcho-capitalists **say** they are 'anarchists' and because they
criticise the State."* [Peter Sabatini, **Social Anarchism**, no. 23, p.
100] However, being opposed to the state is a necessary but not
sufficient condition for being an anarchist (as can be seen from the
history of the anarchist movement). Brian Morris puts it well when he
writes:

> *"The term anarchy comes from the Greek, and essentially means 'no
> ruler.' Anarchists are people who reject all forms of government or
> coercive authority, all forms of hierarchy and domination. They are
> therefore opposed to what the Mexican anarchist Flores Magon called
> the 'sombre trinity' -- state, capital and the church. Anarchists are
> thus opposed to both capitalism and to the state, as well as to all
> forms of religious authority. But anarchists also seek to establish or
> bring about by varying means, a condition of anarchy, that is, a
> decentralised society without coercive institutions, a society
> organised through a federation of voluntary associations. Contemporary
> 'right-wing' libertarians . . . who are often described as
> 'anarchocapitalists' and who fervently defend capitalism, are not in
> any real sense anarchists."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 38]

Rather than call themselves by a name which reflects their origins in
liberalism (and **not** anarchism), the "anarcho"-capitalists have
instead seen fit to try and appropriate the name of anarchism and, in
order to do so, ignore key aspects of anarchist theory in the process.
Little wonder, then, they try and prove their anarchist credentials via
dictionary definitions rather than from the anarchist movement itself
(see [next section](append11.html#app6)).

Caplan's attempt in his FAQ is an example to ignore individualist
anarchist theory and history. Ignored is any attempt to understand their
ideas on property and instead Caplan just concentrates on the fact they
use the word. Caplan also ignores:

> their many statements on being socialists and part of the wider
> socialist movement.
> their opposition to capitalist property-rights in land and other
> scarce resources.
> their recognition that capitalism was based on usury and that it was
> exploitation.
> their attacks on government **and** capital, rather than just
> government.
> their support for strikes and other forms of direct action by workers
> to secure the full product of their labour.

In fact, the only things considered useful seems to be the individualist
anarchist's support for free agreement (something Kropotkin also agreed
with) and their use of the word "property." But even a cursory
investigation indicates the non-capitalist nature of their ideas on
property and the socialistic nature of their theories.

Perhaps Caplan should ponder these words of Kropotkin supporters of the
*"individualist anarchism of the American Proudhonians . . . soon
realise that the individualisation they so highly praise is not
attainable by individual efforts, and . . . abandon the ranks of the
anarchists, and are driven into the liberal individualism of the
classical economist."* [**Kropotkin's Revolutionary Pamphlets**, p. 297]

Caplan seems to confuse the end of the ending place of ex-anarchists
with their starting point. As can be seen from his attempt to co-opt
Proudhon, Spooner and Tucker he has to ignore their ideas and rewrite
history.

6 - Appendix: Defining Anarchism
--------------------------------

In his Appendix *"Defining Anarchism"* we find that Caplan attempts to
defend his dictionary definition of anarchism. He does this by
attempting to refute two arguments, The Philological Argument and the
Historical Argument.

Taking each in turn we find:

Caplan's definition of *"The Philological Argument"* is as follows:

> *"Several critics have noted the origin of the term 'anarchy,' which
> derives from the Greek 'arkhos,' meaning 'ruler,' and the prefix an-,'
> meaning 'without.' It is therefore suggested that in my definition the
> word 'government' should be replaced with the word 'domination' or
> 'rulership'; thus re-written, it would then read: 'The theory or
> doctrine that all forms of rulership are unnecessary, oppressive, and
> undesirable and should be abolished.'"*

Caplan replies by stating that:

> *"This is all good and well, so long as we realise that various groups
> of anarchists will radically disagree about what is or is not an
> instance of 'rulership.'"*

However, in order to refute this argument by this method, he has to
ignore his own methodology. A dictionary definition of ruler is *"a
person who rules by authority."* and *"rule"* is defined as *"to have
authoritative control over people"* or *"to keep (a person or feeling
etc.) under control, to dominate"* [**The Oxford Study Dictionary**]

Hierarchy by its very nature is a form of rulership (hier-***archy***)
and is so opposed by anarchists. Capitalism is based upon wage labour,
in which a worker follows the rules of their boss. This is obviously a
form of hierarchy, of domination. Almost all people (excluding die-hard
supporters of capitalism) would agree that being told what to do, when
to do and how to do by a boss is a form of rulership. Anarchists,
therefore, argue that *"economic exploitation and political domination .
. . [are] two continually interacting aspects of the same thing -- the
subjection of man by man."* [Errico Malatesta, **Life and Ideas**, p.
147] Rocker made the same point, arguing that the *"exploitation of man
by man and the domination of man over man are inseparable, and each is
the condition of the other."* [**Anarcho-Syndicalism**, p. 18]

Thus Caplan is ignoring the meaning of words to state that *"on its own
terms this argument fails to exclude anarcho-capitalists"* because they
define rulership to exclude most forms of archy! Hardly convincing.

Strangely enough, "anarcho"-capitalist icon Murray Rothbard actually
provides evidence that the anarchist position **is** correct. He argues
that the state *"arrogates to itself a monopoly of force, of ultimate
decision-making power, over a given area territorial area."* [**The
Ethics of Liberty**, p. 170] This is obviously a form of rulership.
However, he also argues that *"[o]bviously, in a free society, Smith has
the ultimate decision-making power over his own just property, Jones
over his, etc."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 173] Which, to state the obvious,
means that **both** the state and property is marked by an *"ultimate
decision-making power"* over a given territory. The only "difference" is
that Rothbard claims the former is "just" (i.e. "justly" acquired) and
the latter is "unjust" (i.e. acquired by force). In reality of course,
the modern distribution of property is just as much a product of past
force as is the modern state. In other words, the current property
owners have acquired their property in the same unjust fashion as the
state has its. If one is valid, so is the other. Rothbard (and
"anarcho"-capitalists in general) are trying to have it both ways.

Rothbard goes on to show why statism and private property are
essentially the same thing:

> *"If the State may be said too properly own its territory, then it is
> proper for it to make rules for everyone who presumes to live in that
> area. It can legitimately seize or control private property because
> there is no private property in its area, because it really owns the
> entire land surface. So long as the State permits its subjects to
> leave its territory, then, it can be said to act as does any other
> owner who sets down rules for people living on his property."* [**Op.
> Cit.**, p. 170]

Of course Rothbard does not draw the obvious conclusion. He wants to
maintain that the state is bad and property is good while drawing
attention to their obvious similarities! Ultimately Rothbard is exposing
the bankruptcy of his own politics and analysis. According to Rothbard,
something can look like a state (i.e. have the *"ultimate
decision-making power"* over an area) and act like a state (i.e. *"make
rules for everyone"* who lives in an area, i.e. govern them) but not be
a state. This not a viable position for obvious reasons.

Thus to claim, as Caplan does, that property does not generate
"rulership" is obviously nonsense. Not only does it ignore the
dictionary definition of rulership (which, let us not forget, is
Caplan's **own** methodology) as well as commonsense, it obviously
ignores what the two institutions have in common. **If** the state is to
be condemned as "rulership" then so must property -- for reasons,
ironically enough, Rothbard makes clear!

Caplan's critique of the *"Philological Argument"* fails because he
tries to deny that the social relationship between worker and capitalist
and tenant and landlord is based upon **archy,** when it obviously is.
To quote Proudhon, considered by Tucker as *"the Anarchist **par
excellence,**"* the employee *"is subordinated, exploited: his permanent
condition is one of obedience."* Without *"association"* (i.e.
co-operative workplaces, workers' self-management) there would be *"two
industrial castes of masters and wage-workers which is repugnant to a
free and democratic society,"* castes *"related as subordinates and
superiors."* [**The General Idea of the Revolution**, p. 216]

Moving on, Caplan defines the Historical Argument as:

> *"A second popular argument states that historically, the term
> 'anarchism' has been clearly linked with anarcho-socialists,
> anarcho-communists, anarcho-syndicalists, and other enemies of the
> capitalist system. Hence, the term 'anarcho-capitalism' is a strange
> oxymoron which only demonstrates ignorance of the anarchist
> tradition."*

He argues that *"even if we were to accept the premise of this argument
-- to wit, that the meaning of a word is somehow determined by its
historical usage -- the conclusion would not follow because the minor
premise is wrong. It is simply not true that from its earliest history,
all anarchists were opponents of private property, free markets, and so
on."*

Firstly, anarchism is not just a word, but a political idea and movement
and so the word used in a political context is associated with a given
body of ideas. You cannot use the word to describe something which has
little or nothing in common with that body of ideas. You cannot call
Marxism "anarchism" simply because they share the anarchist opposition
to capitalist exploitation and aim for a stateless society, for example.

Secondly, it is true that anarchists like Tucker were not against the
free market, but they did not consider capitalism to be defined by the
free market but by exploitation and wage labour (as do all socialists).
In this they share a common ground with Market Socialists who, like
Tucker and Proudhon, do not equate socialism with opposition to the
market or capitalism with the "free market." The idea that socialists
oppose *"private property, free markets, and so on"* is just an
assumption by Caplan. Proudhon, for example, was not opposed to
competition, "property" (in the sense of possession) and markets but
during his lifetime and up to the present date he is acknowledged as a
socialist, indeed one of the greatest in French (if not European)
history. Similarly we find Rudolf Rocker writing that the Individualist
Anarchists *"all agree on the point that man be given the full reward of
his labour and recognised in this right the economic basis of all
personal liberty. They regard free competition . . . as something
inherent in human nature . . . They answered the **socialists of other
schools** [emphasis added] who saw in **free competition** one of the
destructive elements of capitalistic society that the evil lies in the
fact that today we have too little rather than too much competition."*
[quoted by Herbert Read, **A One-Man Manifesto**, p. 147] Rocker
obviously considered support for free markets as compatible with
socialism. In other words, Caplan's assumption that all socialists
oppose free markets, competition and so on is simply false -- as can be
seen from the history of the socialist movement. What socialists **do**
oppose is capitalist exploitation -- socialism *"in its wide, generic,
and true sense"* was an *"effort to **abolish** the exploitation of
labour by capital."* [Peter Kropotkin, **Kropotkin's Revolutionary
Pamphlets**, p. 169] In this sense the Individualist Anarchists are
obviously socialists, as Tucker and Labadie constantly pointed out.

In addition, as we have proved elsewhere, Tucker was opposed to
capitalist private property just as much as Kropotkin was. Moreover, it
is clear from Tucker's works that he considered himself an enemy of the
capitalist system and called himself a socialist. Thus Caplan's attempt
to judge the historical argument on its own merits fails because he has
to rewrite history to do so.

Caplan is right to state that the meaning of words change over time, but
this does not mean we should run to use dictionary definitions.
Dictionaries rarely express political ideas well - for example, most
dictionaries define the word "anarchy" as "chaos" and "disorder." Does
that mean anarchists aim to create chaos? Of course not. Therefore,
Caplan's attempt to use dictionary definitions is selective and
ultimately useless - anarchism as a political movement cannot be
expressed by dictionary definitions and any attempt to do so means to
ignore history.

The problems in using dictionary definitions to describe political ideas
can best be seen from the definition of the word "Socialism." According
to the **Oxford Study Dictionary** Socialism is *"a political and
economic theory advocating that land, resources, and the chief
industries should be owned and managed by the State."* The **Webster's
Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary**, conversely, defines socialism as
*"any of various economic and political theories advocating collective
or government ownership and administration of the means of production
and distribution of goods."*

Clearly the latter source has a more accurate definition of socialism
than the former, by allowing for "collective" versus solely "State"
control of productive means. Which definition would be better? It
depends on the person involved. A Marxist, for example, could prefer the
first one simply to exclude anarchism from the socialist movement,
something they have continually tried to do. A right-libertarian could,
again, prefer the first, for obvious reasons. Anarchists would prefer
the second, again for obvious reasons. However neither definition does
justice to the wide range of ideas that have described themselves as
socialist.

Using dictionaries as the basis of defining political movements ensures
that one's views depend on **which** dictionary one uses, and **when**
it was written, and so on. This is why they are not the best means of
resolving disputes -- if resolution of disputes is, in fact, your goal.

Both Kropotkin and Tucker stated that they were socialists and that
anarchism was socialistic. If we take the common modern meaning of the
word as state ownership as the valid one then Tucker and Kropotkin are
**not** socialists and no form of anarchism is socialist. This is
obviously nonsense and it shows the limitations of using dictionary
definitions on political theories.

Therefore Caplan's attempt to justify using the dictionary definition
fails. Firstly, because the definitions used would depend which
dictionary you use. Secondly, dictionary definitions cannot capture the
ins and outs of a **political** theory or its ideas on wider subjects.

Ironically enough, Caplan is repeating an attempt made by State
Socialists to deny Individualist Anarchism its socialist title (see
*"Socialism and the Lexicographers"* in **Instead of a Book**). In reply
to this attempt, Tucker noted that:

> *"The makers of dictionaries are dependent upon specialists for their
> definitions. A specialist's definition may be true or it may be
> erroneous. But its truth cannot be increased or its error diminished
> by its acceptance by the lexicographer. Each definition must stand on
> its own merits."* [**Instead of a Book**, p. 369]

And Tucker provided many quotes from **other** dictionaries to refute
the attempt by the State Socialists to define Individualist Anarchism
outside the Socialist movement. He also notes that any person trying
such a method will *"find that the Anarchistic Socialists are not to be
stripped of one half of their title by the mere dictum of the last
lexicographer."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 365]

Caplan should take note. His technique been tried before and it failed
then and it will fail again for the same reasons.

As far as his case against the Historical Argument goes, this is equally
as flawed. Caplan states that:

> *"Before the Protestant Reformation, the word 'Christian,' had
> referred almost entirely to Catholics (as well as adherents of the
> Orthodox Church) for about one thousand years. Does this reveal any
> linguistic confusion on the part of Lutherans, Calvinists, and so on,
> when they called themselves 'Christians'? Of course not. It merely
> reveals that a word's historical usage does not determine its
> meaning."*

However, as analogies go this is pretty pathetic. Both the Protestants
and Catholics followed the teachings of Christ but had different
interpretations of it. As such they could both be considered Christians
- followers of the Bible. In the case of anarchism, there are two main
groupings - individualist and social. Both Tucker and Bakunin claimed to
follow, apply and develop Proudhon's ideas (and share his opposition to
both state and capitalism) and so are part of the anarchist tradition.

The anarchist movement was based upon applying the core ideas of
Proudhon (his anti-statism and socialism) and developing them in the
same spirit, and these ideas find their roots in **socialist** history
and theory. For example, William Godwin was claimed as an anarchist
after his death by the movement because of his opposition to both state
and private property, something all anarchists oppose. Similarly, Max
Stirner's opposition to both state and capitalist property places him
within the anarchist tradition.

Given that we find fascists and Nazis calling themselves "republicans,"
"democrats," even "liberals" it is worthwhile remembering that the names
of political theories are defined not by who use them, but by the ideas
associated with the name. In other words, a fascist cannot call
themselves a "liberal" any more than a capitalist can call themselves an
"anarchist." To state, as Caplan does, that the historical usage of a
word does not determine its meaning results in utter confusion and the
end of meaningful political debate. If the historical usage of a name is
meaningless will we soon see fascists as well as capitalists calling
themselves anarchists? In other words, the label "anarcho-capitalism" is
a misnomer, pure and simple, as **all** anarchists have opposed
capitalism as an authoritarian system based upon exploitation and wage
slavery.

To ignore the historical usage of a word means to ignore what the
movement that used that word stood for. Thus, if Caplan is correct, an
organisation calling itself the "Libertarian National Socialist Party,"
for example, can rightly call itself libertarian for *"a word's
historical usage does not determine its meaning."* Given that
right-libertarians in the USA have tried to steal the name "libertarian"
from anarchists and anarchist influenced socialists, such a perspective
on Caplan's part makes perfect sense. How ironic that a movement that
defends private property so strongly continually tries to steal names
from other political tendencies.

Perhaps a better analogy for the conflict between anarchism and
"anarcho"- capitalism would be between Satanists and Christians. Would
we consider as Christian a Satanist grouping claiming to be Christian? A
grouping that rejects everything that Christians believe but who like
the name? Of course not. Neither would we consider as a
right-libertarian someone who is against the free market or someone as a
Marxist who supports capitalism. However, that is what Caplan and other
"anarcho"-capitalists want us to do with anarchism.

Both social and individualist anarchists defined their ideas in terms of
both political (abolition of the state) **and** economic (abolition of
exploitation) ideas. Kropotkin defined anarchism as *"the no-government
form of socialism"* while Tucker insisted that anarchism was *"the
abolition of the State and the abolition of usury."* In this they
followed Proudhon who stated that *"[w]e do not admit the government of
man by man any more than the exploitation of man by man."* [quoted by
Peter Marshall, **Demanding the Impossible**, p. 245]

In other words, a political movement's economic ideas are just as much a
part of its theories as their political ideas. Any attempt to consider
one in isolation from the other kills what defines the theory and makes
it unique. And, ultimately, any such attempt, is a lie:

> *"[classical liberalism] is in theory a kind of anarchy without
> socialism, and therefore simply a lie, for freedom is impossible
> without equality, and real anarchy cannot exist without solidarity,
> without socialism."* [Errico Malatesta, **Anarchy**, p. 46]

Therefore Caplan's case against the Historical Argument also fails -
"anarcho-capitalism" is a misnomer because anarchism has always, in all
its forms, opposed capitalism. Denying and re-writing history is hardly
a means of refuting the historical argument.

Caplan ends by stating:

> *"Let us designate anarchism (1) anarchism as you define it. Let us
> designate anarchism (2) anarchism as I and the American Heritage
> College Dictionary define it. This is a FAQ about anarchism (2)."*

Note that here we see again how the dictionary is a very poor foundation
upon to base an argument. Again using **Webster's Ninth New Collegiate
Dictionary**, we find under "anarchist" - *"one who rebels against any
authority, established order, or ruling power."* This definition is very
close to that which "traditional" anarchists have - which is the basis
for our own opposition to the notion that anarchism is merely rebellion
against **State** authority.

Clearly this definition is at odds with Caplan's own view; is Webster's
then wrong, and Caplan's view right? Which view is backed by the theory
and history of the movement? Surely that should be the basis of who is
part of the anarchist tradition and movement and who is not? Rather than
do this, Caplan and other "anarcho"-capitalists rush to the dictionary
(well, those that do not define anarchy as "disorder"). This is for a
reason as anarchism as a political movement as always been explicitly
anti-capitalist and so the term "anarcho"-capitalism is an oxymoron.

What Caplan fails to even comprehend is that his choices are false.
Anarchism can be designated in two ways:

> (1). Anarchism as you define it\
>  (2). Anarchism as the anarchist movement defines it and finds
> expression in the theories developed by that movement.

Caplan chooses anarchism (1) and so denies the whole history of the
anarchist movement. Anarchism is not a word, it is a political theory
with a long history which dictionaries cannot cover. Therefore any
attempt to define anarchism by such means is deeply flawed and
ultimately fails.

That Caplan's position is ultimately false can be seen from the
"anarcho"-capitalists themselves. In many dictionaries anarchy is
defined as *"disorder,"* *"a state of lawlessness"* and so on. Strangely
enough, no "anarcho"-capitalist ever uses **these** dictionary
definitions of "anarchy"! Thus appeals to dictionaries are just as much
a case of defining anarchism as you desire as not using dictionaries.
Far better to look at the history and traditions of the anarchist
movement itself, seek out its common features and apply **those** as
criteria to those seeking to include themselves in the movement. As can
be seen, "anarcho"-capitalism fails this test and, therefore, are not
part of the anarchist movement. Far better for us all if they pick a new
label to call themselves rather than steal our name.

Although most anarchists disagree on many things, the denial of our
history is not one of them.
