H.2 What parts of anarchism do Marxists particularly misrepresent?
==================================================================

Many people involved in politics will soon discover that Marxist groups
(particularly Leninist ones) organise "debates" about anarchism. These
meetings are usually entitled *"Marxism and Anarchism"* and are usually
organised after anarchists have been active in the area or have made the
headlines somewhere.

These meetings, contrary to common sense, are usually not a debate as
(almost always) no anarchists are invited to argue the anarchist
viewpoint and, therefore, they present a one-sided account of *"Marxism
and Anarchism"* in a manner which benefits the organisers. Usually, the
format is a speaker distorting anarchist ideas and history for a long
period of time (both absolutely in terms of the length of the meeting
and relatively in terms of the boredom inflicted on the unfortunate
attendees). It will soon become obvious to those attending that any such
meeting is little more than an unprincipled attack on anarchism with
little or no relationship to what anarchism is actually about. Those
anarchists who attend such meetings usually spend most of their allotted
(usually short) speaking time refuting the nonsense that is undoubtedly
presented. Rather than a **real** discussion between the differences
between anarchism and "Marxism" (i.e. Leninism), the meeting simply
becomes one where anarchists correct the distortions and
misrepresentations of the speaker in order to create the basis of a real
debate. If the reader does not believe this summary we would encourage
them to attend such a meeting and see for themselves.

Needless to say, we cannot hope to reproduce the many distortions
produced in such meetings. However, when anarchists do hit the headlines
(such as in the 1990 poll tax riot in London and the anti-globalisation
movement of the late 1990s and early 2000s), various Marxist papers will
produce articles on "Anarchism" as well. Like the meetings, the articles
are full of so many elementary errors that it takes a lot of effort to
think they are the product of ignorance rather than a conscious desire
to lie (the appendix [*"Anarchism and Marxism"*](append3.html) contains
a few replies to such articles). In addition, many of the founding
fathers of Marxism (and Leninism) also decided to attack anarchism in
similar ways, so this activity does have a long tradition in Marxist
circles (particularly in Leninist and Trotskyist ones). Sadly, Max
Nettlau's comments on Marx and Engels are applicable to many of their
followers today. He argued that they *"acted with that shocking lack of
honesty which was characteristic of **all** their polemics. They worked
with inadequate documentation, which, according to their custom, they
supplemented with arbitrary declarations and conclusions - accepted as
truth by their followers although they were exposed as deplorable
misrepresentations, errors and unscrupulous perversions of the truth."*
[**A Short History of Anarchism**, p. 132] As the reader will discover,
this summary has not lost its relevance today. If you read Marxist
"critiques" of anarchism you will soon discover the same repetition of
"accepted" truths, the same inadequate documentation, the same arbitrary
declarations and conclusions as well as an apparent total lack of
familiarity with the source material they claim to be analysing.

This section of the FAQ lists and refutes many of the most common
distortions Marxists make with regards to anarchism. As will become
clear, many of the most common Marxist attacks on anarchism have little
or no basis in fact but have simply been repeated so often by Marxists
that they have entered the ideology (the idea that anarchists think the
capitalist class will just disappear being, probably, the most famous
one).

Moreover, Marxists make many major and minor distortions of anarchist
theory in passing. For example, Eric Hobsbawm wrote of the *"extremism
of the anarchist rejection of state and organisation"* while being well
aware, as a leading Marxist historian, of numerous anarchist
organisations. [**Revolutionaries**, p. 113] This kind of nonsense has a
long history, with Engels asserting in his infamous diatribe *"The
Bakuninists at work"* that Bakunin *"[a]s early as September 1870 (in
his **Lettres a un francais** [Letters to a Frenchman]) . . . had
declared that the only way to drive the Prussians out of France by a
revolutionary struggle was to do away with all forms of centralised
leadership and leave each town, each village, each parish to wage war on
its own."* For Engels anarchist federalism *"consisted precisely in the
fact that each town acted on its own, declaring that the important thing
was not co-operation with other towns but separation from them, this
precluding any possibility of a combined attack."* This meant *"the
fragmentation and isolation of the revolutionary forces which enabled
the government troops to smash one revolt after the other."* According
to Engels, the anarchists *"proclaimed [this] a principle of supreme
revolutionary wisdom."* [**Collected Works**, vol. 23, p. 592]

In fact, the truth is totally different. Bakunin did, of course, reject
*"centralised leadership"* as it would be *"necessarily very
circumscribed, very short-sighted, and its limited perception cannot,
therefore, penetrate the depth and encompass the whole complex range of
popular life."* However, it is a falsehood to state that he denied the
need for co-ordination of struggles and federal organisations from the
bottom up. As he put it, the revolution must *"foster the
self-organisation of the masses into autonomous bodies, federated from
the bottom upwards."* With regards to the peasants, he thought they will
*"come to an understanding, and form some kind of organisation . . . to
further their mutual interests . . . the necessity to defend their
homes, their families, and their own lives against unforeseen attack . .
. will undoubtedly soon compel them to contract new and mutually
suitable arrangements."* The peasants would be *"freely organised from
the bottom up."* Rather than deny the need for co-ordination, Bakunin
stressed it: *"the peasants, like the industrial city workers, should
unite by federating the fighting battalions, district by district,
assuring a common co-ordinated defence against internal and external
enemies."* [*"Letters to a Frenchman on the present crisis"*, **Bakunin
on Anarchism**, p. 196, p. 206, p. 207 and p. 190] In this he repeated
his earlier arguments concerning social revolution - arguments that
Engels was well aware of.

In other words, Engels deliberately misrepresented Bakunin's ideas while
being an attack on federalism when, in fact, federalism was **not**
actually implemented. It should also be mentioned that Engels opposed
the Spanish workers rising in revolt in the first place. *"A few years
of peaceful bourgeois republic,"* he argued, *"would prepare the ground
in Spain for a proletarian revolution"* and *"instead of staging
isolated, easily crushed rebellions,"* he hoped that the *"Spanish
workers will make use of the republic"* with a *"view to an approaching
revolution."* He ended by asking them not to give the bourgeois
government *"an excuse to suppress the revolutionary movement."* [**Op.
Cit.**, pp. 420-1] In his post-revolt diatribe, Engels repeated this
analysis and suggested that the "Bakuninists" should have simply stood
for election:

> *"At quiet times, when the proletariat knows beforehand that at best
> it can get only a few representatives to parliament and have no chance
> whatever of winning a parliamentary majority, the workers may
> sometimes be made to believe that it is a great revolutionary action
> to sit out the elections at home, and in general, not to attack the
> State in which they live and which oppresses them, but to attack the
> State as such which exists nowhere and which accordingly cannot defend
> itself."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 583]

For some reason, few Leninist quote these recommendations to the Spanish
workers nor do they dwell on the reformist and bureaucratic nature of
the Socialist party inspired by this advice. As we discuss in [section
H.3.10](secH3.html#sech310), the notion that voting in elections was to
*"attack the State"* fits in well with the concept that universal
suffrage equalled the *"political power"* of the proletariat and the
democratic republic was the *"specific form"* of its dictatorship.
Again, for some strange reason, few Leninists mention that either.

The distortions can be somewhat ironic, as can be seen when Trotsky
asserted in 1937 that anarchists are *"willing to replace Bakunin's
patriarchal 'federation of free communes' by the more modern federation
of free soviets."* [**Writings 1936-37**, p. 487] It is hard to know
where to start in this incredulous rewriting of history. Firstly,
Bakunin's federation of free communes was, in fact, based on workers'
councils ("soviets") - see [section I.2.3](secI2.html#seci23). As for
the charge of supporting *"patriarchal"* communes, nothing could be
further from the truth. In his discussion of the Russian peasant commune
(the mir) Bakunin argued that *"patriarchalism"* was one of its *"three
dark features,"* indeed *"the main historical evil . . . against which
we are obliged to struggle with all our might."* This *"evil"*, he
stressed, *"has distorted the whole of Russian life"* and the
*"despotism of the father"* turned the family *"into a school of
triumphant force and tyranny, of daily domestic baseness and
depravity."* The *"same patriarchal principle, the same vile despotism,
and the same base obedience prevail within"* the peasant commune. Any
revolt against *"the hated state power and bureaucratic arbitrariness .
. . simultaneously becomes a revolt against the despotism of the
commune."* The *"war against patriarchalism is now being waged in
virtually every village and every family."*[**Statism and Anarchy**, p.
206, pp. 209-10, p. 210 and p. 214]

As can be seen Trotsky's summary of Bakunin's ideas is totally wrong.
Not only did his ideas on the organisation of the free commune as a
federation of workers' associations predate the soviets by decades, he
also argued against patriarchal relationships and urged their
destruction in the Russian peasant commune (and elsewhere). Indeed, if
any one fits Trotsky's invention it is Marx, not Bakunin. After all,
Marx came round (eventually) to Bakunin's position that the peasant
commune could be the basis for Russia to jump straight to socialism (and
so by-passing capitalism) but without Bakunin's critical analysis of
that institution and its patriarchal and other *"dark"* features.
Similarly, Marx never argued that the future socialist society would be
based on workers' associations and their federation (i.e. workers'
councils). His vision of revolution was formulated in typically
bourgeois structures such as the Paris Commune's municipal council.

We could go on, but space precludes discussing every example. Suffice to
say, it is not wise to take any Marxist assertion of anarchist thought
or history at face value. A common technique is to quote anarchist
writers out of context or before they become anarchists. For example,
Marxist Paul Thomas argues that Bakunin favoured *"blind
destructiveness"* and yet quotes more from Bakunin's pre-anarchist works
(as well as Russian nihilists) than Bakunin's anarchist works to prove
his claim. Similarly, Thomas claims that Bakunin *"defended the
**federes** of the Paris Commune of 1871 on the grounds that they were
strong enough to dispense with theory altogether,"* yet his supporting
quote clearly does not, in fact, say this. [**Karl Marx and the
Anarchists**, pp. 288-90 and p. 285] What Bakunin was, in fact, arguing
was simply that theory must progress from experience and that any
attempt to impose a theory on society would be doomed to create a
*"Procrustean bed"* as no government could *"embrace the infinite
multiplicity and diversity of the real aspirations, wishes and needs
whose sum total constitutes the collective will of a people."* He
explicitly contrasted the Marxist system of *"want[ing] to impose
science upon the people"* with the anarchist desire *"to diffuse science
and knowledge among the people, so that the various groups of human
society, when convinced by propaganda, may organise and spontaneously
combine into federations, in accordance with their natural tendencies
and their real interests, but never according to a plan traced in
advance and **imposed upon the ignorant masses** by a few 'superior'
minds."* [**The Political Theory of Bakunin**, p. 300] A clear
misreading of Bakunin's argument but one which fits nicely into Marxist
preconceptions of Bakunin and anarchism in general.

This tendency to quote out of context or from periods when anarchists
were not anarchists probably explains why so many of these Marxist
accounts of anarchism are completely lacking in references. Take, for
example, the British SWP's Pat Stack who, in the face of stiff
competition, wrote one of the most inaccurate diatribes against
anarchism the world has had the misfortunate to see (namely *"Anarchy in
the UK?"* [**Socialist Review**, no. 246]). There is not a single
reference in the whole article, which is just as well, given the
inaccuracies contained in it. Without references, the reader would not
be able to discover for themselves the distortions and simple errors
contained in it.

For example, Stack asserts that Bakunin *"claimed a purely 'instinctive
socialism.'"* However, the truth is different and this quote from
Bakunin is one by him comparing himself and Marx in the 1840s! In fact,
the **anarchist** Bakunin argued that *"instinct as a weapon is not
sufficient to safeguard the proletariat against the reactionary
machinations of the privileged classes,"* as instinct *"left to itself,
and inasmuch as it has not been transformed into consciously reflected,
clearly determined thought, lends itself easily to falsification,
distortion and deceit."* [**The Political Philosophy of Bakunin**, p.
215] Bakunin saw the process of class struggle as the means of
transforming instinct into conscious thought. As he put it, the *"goal,
then, is to make the worker fully aware of what he [or she] wants, to
unjam within him [or her] a steam of thought corresponding to his [or
her] instinct."* This is done by *"a single path, that of **emancipation
through practical action**,"* by *"workers' solidarity in their struggle
against the bosses,"* of *"collective struggle of the workers against
the bosses."* This would be complemented by socialist organisations
*"propagandis[ing] its principles."* [**The Basic Bakunin**, p. 102, p.
103 and p. 109] Clearly, Stack is totally distorting Bakunin's ideas on
the subject.

This technique of quoting Bakunin when he spoke about (or when he wrote
in) his pre-anarchist days in the 1840s, i.e. nearly 20 years **before**
he became an anarchist, or from Proudhon's non-anarchist and
posthumously published work on property (in which Proudhon saw
small-scale property as a bulwark against state tyranny) to attack
anarchism is commonplace. So it is always wise to check the source
material and any references (assuming that they are provided). Only by
doing this can it be discovered whether a quote reflects the opinions of
individuals when they were anarchists or whether they are referring to
periods when they were no longer, or had not yet become, anarchists.

Ultimately, though, these kinds of articles by Marxists simply show the
ideological nature of their own politics and say far more about Marxism
than anarchism. After all, if their politics were strong they would not
need to distort anarchist ideas! In addition, these essays are usually
marked by a lot of (usually inaccurate) attacks on the ideas (or
personal failings) of individual anarchists (usually Proudhon and
Bakunin and sometimes Kropotkin). No modern anarchist theorist is
usually mentioned, never mind discussed. Obviously, for most Marxists,
anarchists must repeat parrot-like the ideas of these "great men."
However, while Marxists may do this, anarchists have always rejected
this approach. We deliberately call ourselves **anarchists** rather than
Proudhonists, Bakuninists, Kropotkinists, or after any other person. As
Malatesta argued in 1876 (the year of Bakunin's death) *"[w]e follow
ideas and not men, and rebel against this habit of embodying a principle
in a man."* [**Errico Malatesta: His Life and Ideas**, p. 198]

Therefore, anarchists, unlike many (most?) Marxists do not believe that
some prophet wrote down the scriptures in past centuries and if only we
could reach a correct understanding of these writings today we would see
the way forward. Chomsky put it extremely well:

> *"The whole concept of Marxist or Freudian or anything like that is
> very odd. These concepts belong to the history of organised religion.
> Any living person, no matter how gifted, will make some contributions
> intermingled with error and partial understanding. We try to
> understand and improve on their contributions and eliminate the
> errors. But how can you identify yourself as a Marxist, or a Freudian,
> or an X-ist, whoever X may be? That would be to treat the person as a
> God to be revered, not a human being whose contributions are to be
> assimilated and transcended. It's a crazy idea, a kind of idolatry."*
> [**The Chomsky Reader**, pp. 29-30]

This means that anarchists recognise that any person, no matter how
great or influential, are just human. They make mistakes, they fail to
live up to all the ideals they express, they are shaped by the society
they live in, and so on. Anarchists recognise this fact and extract the
positive aspects of past anarchist thinkers, reject the rest and develop
what we consider the living core of their ideas, learn from history and
constantly try to bring anarchist ideas up-to-date (after all, a lot has
changed since the days of Proudhon, Bakunin and Kropotkin and this has
to be taken into account). As Max Nettlau put it with regards to
Proudhon, *"we have to extract from his work useful teachings that would
be of great service to our modern libertarians, who nevertheless have to
find their own way from theory to practice and to the critique of our
present-day conditions, as Proudhon did in his time. This does not call
for a slavish imitation; it implies using his work to inspire us and
enable us to profit by his experience."* [**A Short History of
Anarchism**, pp. 46-7] Similarly for other anarchists - we see them as a
source of inspiration upon which to build rather than a template which
to copy. This means to attack anarchism by, say, attacking Bakunin's or
Proudhon's personal failings is to totally miss the point. While
anarchists may be inspired by the ideas of, say, Bakunin or Proudhon it
does not mean we blindly follow all of their ideas. Far from it! We
critically analysis their ideas and keep what is living and reject what
is useless or dead. Sadly, such common sense is lacking in many who
critique anarchism.

However, the typical Marxist approach does have its benefits from a
political perspective. It is very difficult for Marxists and Leninists
to make an objective criticism of Anarchism for, as Albert Meltzer
pointed out, *"by its nature it undermines all the suppositions basic to
Marxism. Marxism was held out to be the basic working class philosophy
(a belief which has utterly ruined the working class movement
everywhere). It holds that the industrial proletariat cannot owe its
emancipation to anyone but themselves alone. It is hard to go back on
that and say that the working class is not yet ready to dispense with
authority placed over it . . . Marxism normally tries to refrain from
criticising anarchism as such - unless driven to doing so, when it
exposes its own authoritarianism . . . and concentrates its attacks not
on Anarchism, but on Anarchists."* [**Anarchism: Arguments for and
Against**, p. 62] Needless to say, this technique is the one usually
applied by Marxists (although, we must stress that usually their account
of the ideas of Proudhon, Bakunin, and Kropotkin are so distorted that
they fail even to do this!).

So anarchist theory has developed since Proudhon, Bakunin and Kropotkin.
At each period in history anarchism advanced in its understanding of the
world, the anarchism of Bakunin was a development of that of Proudhon,
these ideas were again developed by the anarcho-communists of the 1880s
and by the syndicalists of the 1890's, by the Italian Malatesta, the
Russian Kropotkin, the Mexican Flores Magon and many other individuals
and movements. Today we stand on their shoulders, not at their feet.

As such, to concentrate on the ideas of a few *"leaders"* misses the
point totally. While anarchism contains many of the core insights of,
say, Bakunin, it has also developed them and added to them. It has,
concretely, taken into account, say, the lessons of the Russian and
Spanish revolutions and so on. As such, even assuming that Marxist
accounts of certain aspects of the ideas of Proudhon, Bakunin and
Kropotkin were correct, they would have to be shown to be relevant to
modern anarchism to be of any but historical interest. Sadly, Marxists
generally fail to do this and, instead, we are subject to a (usually
inaccurate) history lesson.

In order to understand, learn from and transcend previous theorists we
must honestly present their ideas. Unfortunately many Marxists do not do
this and so this section of the FAQ involves correcting the many
mistakes, distortions, errors and lies that Marxists have subjected
anarchism to. Hopefully, with this done, a real dialogue can develop
between Marxists and anarchists. Indeed, this has happened between
libertarian Marxists (such as council communists and Situationists) and
anarchists and both tendencies have benefited from it. Perhaps this
dialogue between libertarian Marxists and anarchists is to be expected,
as the mainstream Marxists have often misrepresented the ideas of
libertarian Marxists as well - when not dismissing them as anarchists!

H.2.1 Do anarchists reject defending a revolution?
--------------------------------------------------

According to many Marxists anarchists either reject the idea of
defending a revolution or think that it is not necessary. The
Trotskyists of **Workers' Power** present a typical Marxist account of
what **they** consider as anarchist ideas on this subject:

> "the anarchist conclusion is not to build any sort of state in the
> first place - not even a democratic workers' state. But how could we
> stop the capitalists trying to get their property back, something they
> will definitely try and do?
>
> "Should the people organise to stop the capitalists raising private
> armies and resisting the will of the majority? If the answer is yes,
> then that organisation - whatever you prefer to call it - is a state:
> an apparatus designed to enable one class to rule over another.
>
> "The anarchists are rejecting something which is necessary if we are
> to beat the capitalists and have a chance of developing a classless
> society." [*"What's wrong with anarchism?"*, pp. 12-13, **World
> Revolution: Prague S26 2000**, p. 13]

It would be simple to quote Malatesta from 1891 on this issue and leave
it at that. As he put some seem to suppose *"that anarchists, in the
name of their principles, would wish to see that strange freedom
respected which violates and destroys the freedom and life of others.
They seem almost to believe that after having brought down government
and private property we would allow both to be quietly built up again,
because of respect for the **freedom** of those who might feel the need
to be rulers and property owners. A truly curious way of interpreting
our ideas."* [**Anarchy**, pp. 42-3] Pretty much common sense, so you
would think! Sadly, this appears to not be the case. As such, we have to
explain anarchist ideas on the defence of a revolution and why this
necessity need not imply a state and, if it did, then it signifies the
end of the revolution.

The argument by **Workers' Power** is very common with the Leninist left
and contains three fallacies, which we expose in turn. Firstly, we have
to show that anarchists have always seen the necessity of defending a
revolution. This shows that the anarchist opposition to the *"democratic
workers' state"* (or *"dictatorship of the proletariat"*) has nothing to
do with beating the ruling class and stopping them regaining their
positions of power. Secondly, we have to discuss the anarchist and
Marxist definitions of what constitutes a *"state"* and show what they
have in common and how they differ. Thirdly, we must summarise why
anarchists oppose the idea of a *"workers' state"* in order for the
**real** reasons why anarchists oppose it to be understood. Each issue
will be discussed in turn.

For revolutionary anarchists, it is a truism that a revolution will need
to defend itself against counter-revolutionary threats. Bakunin, for
example, while strenuously objecting to the idea of a *"dictatorship of
the proletariat"* also thought a revolution would need to defend itself:

> *"Immediately after established governments have been overthrown,
> communes will have to reorganise themselves along revolutionary lines
> . . . In order to defend the revolution, their volunteers will at the
> same time form a communal militia. But no commune can defend itself in
> isolation. So it will be necessary to radiate revolution outward, to
> raise all of its neighbouring communes in revolt . . . and to federate
> with them for common defence."* [**No Gods, No Masters**, vol. 1, p.
> 142]

And:

> *"the Alliance of all labour associations . . . will constitute the
> Commune . . . there will be a standing federation of the barricades
> and a Revolutionary Communal Council . . . [made up of] delegates . .
> . invested with binding mandates and accountable and revocable at all
> times . . . all provinces, communes and associations . . . [will]
> delegate deputies to an agreed place of assembly (all . . . invested
> with binding mandated and accountable and subject to recall), in order
> to found the federation of insurgent associations, communes and
> provinces . . . and to organise a revolutionary force with the
> capacity of defeating the reaction . . . it is through the very act of
> extrapolation and organisation of the Revolution with an eye to the
> mutual defences of insurgent areas that the universality of the
> Revolution . . . will emerge triumphant."* [**Op. Cit.**, pp. 155-6]

Malatesta agreed, explicitly pointing to *"corps of volunteers
(anarchist formations)"* as a means of defending a revolution from
*"attempts to reduce a free people to a state of slavery again."* To
defend a revolution required *"the necessary geographical and mechanical
knowledge, and above all large masses of the population willing to go
and fight. A government can neither increase the abilities of the former
nor the will and courage of the latter."* [**Anarchy**, p. 42] Decades
later, his position had not changed and he was still arguing for the
*"creation of voluntary militia, without powers to interfere as militia
in the life of the community, but only to deal with any armed attacks by
the forces of reaction to re-establish themselves, or to resist outside
intervention"* for only *"the people in arms, in possession of the land,
the factories and all the natural wealth"* could *"defend . . . the
revolution."* [**Errico Malatesta: His Life and Ideas**, p. 166 and p.
170]

Alexander Berkman concurred. In his classic introduction to anarchism,
he devoted a whole chapter to the issue which he helpfully entitled
*"Defense of the Revolution"*. He noted that it was *"your duty, as an
Anarchist, to protect your liberty, to resist coercion and compulsion .
. . the social revolution . . . will defend itself against invasion from
any quarter . . . The armed workers and peasants are the only effective
defence of the revolution. By means of their unions and syndicates they
must always be on guard against counter-revolutionary attack."* [**What
is Anarchism?**, pp. 231-2] Emma Goldman clearly and unambiguously
stated that she had *"always insisted that an armed attack on the
Revolution must be met with armed force"* and that *"an armed
counter-revolutionary and fascist attack can be met in no way except by
an armed defence."* [**Vision on Fire**, p. 222 and p. 217] Kropotkin,
likewise, took it as a given that *"a society in which the workers would
have a dominant voice"* would require a revolution to create and *"each
time that such a period of accelerated evolution and reconstruction on a
grand scale begins, civil war is liable to break out on a small or large
scale."* The question was *"how to attain the greatest results with the
most limited amount of civil war, the smallest number of victims, and a
minimum of mutual embitterment."* To achieve this there was *"only one
means; namely, that the oppressed part of society should obtain the
clearest possible conception of what they intend to achieve, and how,
and that they should be imbued with the enthusiasm which is necessary
for that achievement."* Thus, *"there are periods in human development
when a conflict is unavoidable, and civil war breaks out quite
independently of the will of particular individuals."* [**Memiors of a
Revolutionist**, pp. 270-1]

So Durruti, while fighting at the front during the Spanish revolution,
was not saying anything new or against anarchist theory when he stated
that *"the bourgeois won't let us create a libertarian communist society
simply because we want to. They'll fight back and defend their
privileges. The only way we can establish libertarian communism is by
destroying the bourgeoisie"* [quoted by Abel Paz, **Durruti in the
Spanish Revolution**, p. 484] Clearly, anarchism has always recognised
the necessity of defending a revolution and proposed ideas to ensure it
(ideas applied with great success by, for example, the Makhnovists in
the Ukrainian Revolution and the CNT militias during the Spanish). As
such, any assertion that anarchism rejects the necessity of defending a
revolution is simply false. Sadly, it is one Marxists make repeatedly
(undoubtedly inspired by Engels similar distortions - see [section
H.4.7](secH4.html#sech47)).

Which, of course, brings us to the second assertion, namely that any
attempt to defend a revolution means that a state has been created
(regardless of what it may be called). For anarchists, such an argument
simply shows that Marxists do not really understand what a state is.
While the Trotskyist definition of a *"state"* may be (to quote
**Workers' Power**) *"an apparatus designed to enable one class to rule
another,"* the anarchist definition is somewhat different. Anarchists,
of course, do not deny that the modern state is (to use Malatesta's
excellent expression) *"the bourgeoisie's servant and **gendarme**."*
[**Anarchy**, p. 23] However, as we discuss in [section
H.3.7](secH3.html#sech37), the Marxist analysis is superficial and
fundamentally metaphysical rather than scientific. Anarchists take an
evolutionary perspective on the state and, as a result, argue that every
state that has ever existed has defended the power of a minority class
and, unsurprisingly, has developed certain features to facilitate this.
The key one is centralisation of power. This ensures that the working
people are excluded from the decision making process and power remains a
tool of the ruling class. As such, the centralisation of power (while it
may take many forms) is the key means by which a class system is
maintained and, therefore, a key aspect of a state.

As Kropotkin put, the State idea *"includes the existence of a power
situated above society"* as well as *"a **territorial concentration** as
well as the concentration of many functions of the life of societies in
the hands of a few."* It *"implies some new relationships between
members of society . . . in order to subject some classes to the
domination of others"* and this becomes obvious *"when one studies the
origins of the State."* [**The State: Its Historic Role**, p. 10] This
was the case with representative democracy:

> *"To attack the central power, to strip it of its prerogatives, to
> decentralise, to dissolve authority, would have been to abandon to the
> people the control of its affairs, to run the risk of a truly popular
> revolution. That is why the bourgeoisie sought to reinforce the
> central government even more."* [Kropotkin, **Words of a Rebel**, p.
> 143]

This meant, Kropotkin continued, that the *"representative system was
organised by the bourgeoisie to ensure their domination, and it will
disappear with them. For the new economic phase that is about to begin
we must seek a new form of political organisation, based on a principle
quite different from that of representation. The logic of events imposes
it."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 125] This suggests that the Marxist notion that
we can use a state (i.e., any centralised and hierarchical social
structure) to organise and defend a social revolution is based on flawed
reasoning in which it *"seems to be taken for granted that Capitalism
and the workers' movement both have the same end in view. If this were
so, they might perhaps use the same means; but as the capitalist is out
to perfect his system of exploitation and government, whilst the worker
is out for emancipation and liberty, naturally the same means cannot be
employed for both purposes."* [George Barrett, **Objections to
Anarchism**, p. 343]

To reproduce in the new society social structures which share the same
characteristics (such as centralisation and delegation of power) which
mark the institutions of class society would be a false step, one which
can only recreate a new form of class system in which a new ruling elite
govern and exploit the many. So while we agree with Marxists that the
main function of the state is to defend class society, we also stress
the structure of the state has evolved to execute that role. In the
words of Rudolf Rocker:

> *"[S]ocial institutions . . . do not arise arbitrarily, but are called
> into being by special needs to serve definite purposes . . . The newly
> arisen possessing classes had need of a political instrument of power
> to maintain their economic and social privileges over the masses of

> oppression into an instrument for the liberation of the oppressed. The
> state can only be what it is: the defender of mass-exploitation and
> social privileges, and creator of privileged classes."*
> [**Anarcho-Syndicalism**, pp. 14-5]

As such, a new form of society, one based on the participation of all in
the affairs of society (and a classless society can be nothing else)
means the end of the state. This is because it has been designed to
**exclude** the participation a classless society needs in order to
exist. In anarchist eyes, it is an abuse of the language to call the
self-managed organisations by which the former working class manage (and
defend) a free society a state.

However, as **Workers Power** indicate, it could be objected that the
anarchist vision of a federation of communal and workplace assemblies
and volunteer militias to defend it is simply a new form of state. In
other words, that the anarchists advocate what most people (including
most Marxists) would call a state as this federal system is based on
social organisation, collective decision making and (ultimately) the
armed people. This was the position of Marx and Engels, who asserted
against Bakunin that *"to call this machine a 'revolutionary Commune
organised from the bottom to top' makes little difference. The name
changes nothing of the substance"* for to be able to do anything at all
the communal councils *"must be vested with some power and supported by
a public force."* [**Collected Works**, vol. 23, p. 469]

Anarchists reject this argument. To quote Daniel Guérin, initially
Bakunin used the term state *"as synonyms for 'social collective.' The
anarchists soon saw, however, that it was rather dangerous for them to
use the same word as the authoritarians while giving it a quite
different meaning. They felt that a new concept called for a new word
and that the use of the old term could be dangerously ambiguous; so they
ceased to give the name 'State' to the social collective of the
future."* [**Anarchism**, pp. 60-1] This is more than mere labels or
semantics as it gets to the heart of the difference between libertarian
and authoritarian conceptions of society and social change. Anarchists
argue that the state is structured to ensure minority rule and,
consequently, a "workers' state" would be a new form of minority rule
over the workers. For this reason we argue that working class
self-management from the bottom-up cannot be confused with a "state."
The Russian Revolution showed the validity of this, with the Bolsheviks
calling their dictatorship a "workers' state" in spite of the workers
having no power in it.

Anarchists have long pointed out that government is not the same as
collective decision making and to call the bottom-up communal system
anarchists aim for a "state" when its role is to promote and ensure mass
participation in social life is nonsense. That Marxists are vaguely
aware of this obvious fact explains why they often talk of a
"semi-state", a "new kind of state", a state "unique in history," or use
some other expression to describe their post-revolutionary system. This
would be a state (to use Engels words) which is *"no longer a state in
the proper sense of the word."* [quoted by Lenin, **Op. Cit.**, p. 319]
If that **is** the case, then why call it state?

Somewhat ironically, Engels provided more than enough support for the
anarchist position. It is perfectly possible to have social organisation
and it **not** be a state. When discussing the Native American Iroquois
Confederacy, Engels noted that *"organ of the Confederacy was a Federal
Council"* which was *"elected . . . and could always be removed"* by
popular assemblies. There was *"no chief executive"* but *"two supreme
war chiefs"* and *"[w]hen war broke out it was carried on mainly by
volunteers."* Yet this was *"the organisation of a society which as yet
knows no **state**."* [**Selected Works**, p. 517, p. 518 and p. 516] In
the anarchist commune there is a federal council elected and mandated by
popular assemblies. These, in turn, are federated in a similar bottom-up
manner. The means of production have been expropriated and held by
society as a whole and so classes have been abolished. Volunteer
militias have been organised for self-defence against
counter-revolutionary attempts to subject the free people to authority.
Why is this **not** a society which *"knows no **state**"*? Is it
because the anarchist commune is fighting against the capitalist class?
If so, does this mean that the Iroquois Confederacy became a state when
it waged war against those seeking to impose bourgeois rule on it? That
is doubtful and so Marx's assertion is simply wrong and reflects both
the confusion at the heart of the Marxist theory of the state and the
illogical depths Marxists sink to when attacking anarchism.

This not a matter of mere "labels" as Marxists assert, but rather gets
to the key issue of who has the real power in a revolution - the people
armed or a new minority (the "revolutionary" government). In other
words, most Marxists cannot tell the difference between libertarian
organisation (power to the base and decision making from the bottom-up)
and the state (centralised power in a few hands and top-down decision
making). Which helps explain why the Bolshevik revolution was such a
failure. The confusion of working class power with party power is one of
the root problems with Marxism. So why do most Marxists tend to call
their post-revolutionary organisation a state? Simply because, at some
level, they recognise that, in reality, the working class does not wield
power in the so-called "workers' state": the party does. This was the
case in Russia. The working class never wielded power under the
Bolsheviks and here is the most obvious contradiction in the Marxist
theory of the state - a contradiction which, as we discuss in [section
H.3.8](secH3.html#sech38) the Leninists solved by arguing that the party
had to assert its power **over** the working class for its own good.

Moreover, as we discuss in [section H.3.9](secH3.html#sech39), it is
both simplistic and wrong to argue that the state is simply the tool of
economic classes. The state is a source of social inequality in and of
itself and, consequently, can oppress and exploit the working class just
as much as, and independently of, any economically dominant class:

> "**All political power inevitably creates a privileged situation** for
> the men who exercise it. Thus it violates, from the beginning, the
> equalitarian principle and strikes at the heart of the Social
> Revolution . . . [It] inevitably becomes a source of other privileges,

> "**Thus it forms a new privileged caste**, at first politically and
> later economically . . . It sows everywhere the seed of inequality and
> soon infects the whole social organism." [Voline, **The Unknown
> Revolution**, p. 249]

So if it **were** simply a question of consolidating a revolution and
its self-defence then there would be no argument:

The question is, therefore, one of **who** *"seizes power"* - will it be
the mass of the population or will it be a party claiming to represent
it. The difference is vital and it confuses the issue to use the same
word "state" to describe two such fundamentally different structures as
a "bottom-up" self-managed communal federation and a "top-down"
hierarchical centralised organisation (such as has been every state that
has existed). This explains why anarchists reject the idea of a
*"democratic workers' state"* as the means by which a revolution defends
itself. Rather than signify working class power or management of
society, it signifies the opposite - the seizure of power of a minority
(in this case, the leaders of the vanguard party).

Anarchists argue that the state is designed to exclude the mass of the
population from the decision making process. This, ironically for
Trotskyism, was one of the reasons why leading Bolsheviks (including
Lenin and Trotsky) argued for a workers state. The centralisation of
power implied by the state was essential so that the vanguard party
could ignore (to use **Worker's Power**'s phrase) *"the will of the
majority."* This particular perspective was clearly a lesson they
learned from their experiences during the Russian Revolution - as we
discussed in [section H.1.2](secH1.html#sech12) the notion that the
*"dictatorship of the proletariat"* was, in fact, the *"dictatorship of
the party"* was a commonplace ideological truism in Leninist circles. As
anarchists had warned, it was a dictatorship **over** the proletariat
and acknowledged as such by the likes of Lenin and Trotsky.

Needless to say, **Workers' Power** (like most Trotskyists) blame the
degeneration of the Russian revolution on the Civil War and its
isolation. However, the creation of a party dictatorship was not seen in
these terms and, moreover, as we discuss in detail in [section
H.6](secH6.html) the Bolshevik undermining of working class autonomy and
democracy started well **before** the outbreak of civil war, thus
confirming anarchist theory. These conclusions of leading Leninists
simply justified the actions undertaken by the Bolsheviks from the
start.

This is why anarchists reject the idea of a *"democratic workers'
state."* Simply put, as far as it is a state, it cannot be democratic
and in as far as it is democratic, it cannot be a state. The Leninist
idea of a *"workers' state"* means, in fact, the seizure of power by the
party. This, we must stress, naturally follows from the reality of the
state. It is designed for minority rule and excludes, by its very
nature, mass participation and this aspect of the state was one which
the leading lights of Bolshevism agreed with. Little wonder, then, that
in practice the Bolshevik regime suppressed of any form of democracy
which hindered the power of the party. Maurice Brinton summed up the
issue well when he argued that *"'workers' power' cannot be identified
or equated with the power of the Party - as it repeatedly was by the
Bolsheviks . . . What 'taking power' really implies is that the vast
majority of the working class at last realises its ability to manage
both production and society - and organises to this end."* [**The
Bolsheviks and Workers' Control**, p. xiv]

In summary, therefore, anarchists reject the idea that the defence of a
revolution can be conducted by a state. As Bakunin once put it, there is
the *"Republic-State"* and there is *"the system of the
Republic-Commune, the Republic-Federation, i.e. the system of
**Anarchism.** This is the politics of the Social Revolution, which aims
at the abolition of the **State** and establishment of the economic,
entirely free organisation of the people - organisation from bottom to
top by means of federation."* [**The Political Philosophy of Bakunin**,
p. 314] Indeed, creating a new state will simply destroy the most
important gain of any revolution - working class autonomy - and its
replacement by another form of minority rule (by the party). Anarchists
have always argued that the defence of a revolution must not be confused
with the state and so argue for the abolition of the state **and** the
defence of a revolution. Only when working class people actually run
themselves society will a revolution be successful. For anarchists, this
means that *"effective emancipation can be achieved only by the
**direct, widespread, and independent action** . . . **of the workers
themselves**, grouped . . . in their own class organisations . . . on
the basis of concrete action and self-government, **helped but not
governed**, by revolutionaries working in the very midst of, and not
above the mass and the professional, technical, defence and other
branches."* [Voline, **Op. Cit.**, p. 197]

This means that anarchists argue that the state cannot be transformed or
adjusted, but has to be smashed by a social revolution and replaced with
organisations and structures created by working class people during
their own struggles (see [section H.1.4](secH1.html#sech14) for
details). Anarchist opposition to the so-called workers' state has
absolutely **nothing** to do with the issue of defending a revolution,
regardless of what Marxists assert.

H.2.2 Do anarchists reject *"class conflict"* and *"collective struggle"*?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Of course not. Anarchists have always taken a keen interest in the class
struggle, in the organisation, solidarity and actions of working class
people. Anarchist Nicholas Walter summarised the obvious and is worth
quoting at length:

> "Virtually all forms of revolutionary socialism during the nineteenth
> century, whether authoritarian or libertarian, were based on the
> concept of class struggle . . . The term anarchist was first adopted

Anyone even remotely aware of anarchism and its history could not fail
to notice that class struggle plays a key role in anarchist theory,
particularly (but not exclusively) in its revolutionary form. To assert
otherwise is simply to lie about anarchism. Sadly, Marxists have been
known to make such an assertion.

For example, Pat Stack of the British SWP argued that anarchists
*"dismiss . . . the importance of the collective nature of change"* and
so *"downplays the centrality of the working class"* in the
revolutionary process. This, he argues, means that for anarchism the
working class *"is not the key to change."* He stresses that for
Proudhon, Bakunin and Kropotkin *"revolutions were not about . . .
collective struggle or advance"* and that anarchism *"despises the
collectivity."* Amazingly he argues that for Kropotkin, *"far from
seeing class conflict as the dynamic for social change as Marx did, saw
co-operation being at the root of the social process."* Therefore,
*"[i]t follows that if class conflict is not the motor of change, the
working class is not the agent and collective struggle not the means.
Therefore everything from riot to bomb, and all that might become
between the two, was legitimate when ranged against the state, each with
equal merit."* [*"Anarchy in the UK?"*, **Socialist Review**, no. 246]
Needless to say, he makes the usual exception for anarcho-syndicalists,
thereby showing his total ignorance of anarchism **and** syndicalism
(see [section H.2.8](secH2.html#sech28)).

Assertions like these are simply incredible. It is hard to believe that
anyone who is a leading member of a Leninist party could write such
nonsense which suggests that Stack is aware of the truth and simply
decides to ignore it. All in all, it is **very** easy to refute these
assertions. All we have to do is, unlike Stack, to quote from the works
of Bakunin, Kropotkin and other anarchists. Even the briefest
familiarity with the writings of revolutionary anarchism would soon
convince the reader that Stack really does not know what he is talking
about.

Take, for example, Bakunin. Rather than reject class conflict,
collective struggle or the key role of the working class, Bakunin based
his political ideas on all three. As he put it, there was, *"between the
proletariat and the bourgeoisie, an irreconcilable antagonism which
results inevitably from their respective stations in life."* He stressed
that *"war between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie is unavoidable"*
and would only end with the *"abolition of the bourgeoisie as a distinct
class."* In order for the worker to *"become strong"* he *"must unite"*
with other workers in *"the union of all local and national workers'
associations into a world-wide association, **the great International
Working-Men's Association.**"* It was only *"through practice and
collective experience"* and *"the progressive expansion and development
of the economic struggle [that] will bring [the worker] more to
recognise his [or her] true enemies: the privileged classes, including
the clergy, the bourgeoisie, and the nobility; and the State, which
exists only to safeguard all the privileges of those classes."* There
was *"but a single path, that of **emancipation through practical
action**"* which *"has only one meaning. It means workers' solidarity in
their struggle against the bosses. It means **trades-unions,
organisation, and the federation of resistance funds.**"* Then, *"when
the revolution - brought about by the force of circumstances - breaks
out, the International will be a real force and know what it has to
do"*, namely to *"take the revolution into its own hands"* and become
*"an earnest international organisation of workers' associations from
all countries"* which will be *"capable of replacing this departing
political world of States and bourgeoisie."* [**The Basic Bakunin**, pp.
97-8, p. 103 and p. 110]

Hardly the words of a man who rejected class conflict, the working class
and the collective nature of change! Nor is this an isolated argument
from Bakunin, it recurs continuously throughout Bakunin's works. For
Bakunin, the *"initiative in the new movement will belong to the people
. . . in Western Europe, to the city and factory workers - in Russia,
Poland, and most of the Slavic countries, to the peasants."* However,
*"in order that the peasants rise up, it is absolutely necessary that
the initiative in this revolutionary movement be taken up by the city
workers . . . who combine in themselves the instincts, ideas, and
conscious will of the Social Revolution."* [**The Political Philosophy
of Bakunin**, p. 375] Similarly, he argued that *"equality"* was the
*"aim"* of the International Workers' Association and *"the organisation
of the working class its strength, the unification of the proletariat
the world over . . . its weapon, its only policy."* He stressed that
*"to create a people's force capable of crushing the military and civil
force of the State, it is necessary to organise the proletariat."*
[quoted by K.J. Kenafick, **Michael Bakunin and Karl Marx**, p. 95 and
p. 254]

Strikes played a very important role in Bakunin's ideas (as they do in
all revolutionary anarchist thought). He saw the strike as *"the
beginnings of the social war of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie
. . . Strikes are a valuable instrument from two points of view.
Firstly, they electrify the masses . . . awaken in them the feeling of
the deep antagonism which exists between their interests and those of
the bourgeoisie . . . secondly they help immensely to provoke and
establish between the workers of all trades, localities and countries
the consciousness and very fact of solidarity: a twofold action, both
negative and positive, which tends to constitute directly the new world
of the proletariat, opposing it almost in an absolute way to the
bourgeois world."* [quoted by Caroline Cahm, **Kropotkin and the Rise of
Revolutionary Anarchism 1872-1886**, pp. 216-217] For Bakunin, strikes
train workers for social revolution as they *"create, organise, and form
a workers' army, an army which is bound to break down the power of the
bourgeoisie and the State, and lay the ground for a new world."* [**The
Political Philosophy of Bakunin**, pp. 384-5]

The revolution would be *"an insurrection of all the people and the
voluntary organisation of the workers from below upward."* [**Statism
and Anarchy**, p. 179] As we argue in [section
I.2.3](secI2.html#seci23), the very process of collective class struggle
would, for Bakunin and other anarchists, create the basis of a free
society. Thus, in Bakunin's eyes, the *"future social organisation must
be made solely from the bottom upwards, by the free association or
federation of workers, firstly in their unions, then in the communes,
regions, nations and finally in a great federation, international and
universal."* [**Michael Bakunin: Selected Writings**, p. 206]

In other words, the basic structure created by the revolution would be
based on the working classes own combat organisations, as created in
their struggles against oppression and exploitation. The link between
present and future would be labour unions (workers' associations), which
played the key role of both the means to abolish capitalism and the
state and as the framework of a socialist society. For Bakunin, the
*"very essence of socialism"* lies in *"the irrepressible conflict
between the workers and the exploiters of labour."* A *"living,
powerful, socialist movement"* can *"be made a reality only by the
awakened revolutionary consciousness, the collective will, and the
organisation of the working masses themselves."* [**Bakunin on
Anarchism**, p. 191 and p. 212] Therefore, it was essential to
*"[o]rganise always more and more the practical militant international
solidarity of the toilers of all trades and of all countries, and
remember . . . you will find an immense, an irresistible force in this
universal collectivity."* Hence Bakunin's support for self-discipline
within self-managed organisations, which came directly from the his
awareness of the **collective** nature of social change: *"Today, in
revolutionary action as in labour itself, collectivism must replace
individualism. Understand clearly that in organising yourselves you will
be stronger than all the political leaders in the world."* [quoted by
Kenafick, **Op. Cit.**, p. 291 and p. 244]

All of which is quite impressive for someone who was a founding father
of a theory which, according to Stack, downplayed the *"centrality of
the working class,"* argued that the working class was *"not the key to
change,"* dismissed *"the importance of the collective nature of
change"* as well as *"collective struggle or advance"* and *"despises
the collectivity"*! Clearly, to argue that Bakunin held any of these
views simply shows that the person making such statements does not have
a clue what they are talking about.

The same, needless to say, applies to all revolutionary anarchists.
Kropotkin built upon Bakunin's arguments and, like him, based his
politics on collective working class struggle and organisation. He
consistently stressed that *"the Anarchists have always advised taking
an active part in those workers' organisations which carry on the
**direct** struggle of Labour against Capital and its protector - the
State."* Such struggle, *"better than any other indirect means, permits
the worker to obtain some temporary improvements in the present
conditions of work, while it opens his eyes to the evil done by
Capitalism and the State that supports it, and wakes up his thoughts
concerning the possibility of organising consumption, production, and
exchange without the intervention of the capitalist and the State."*
[**Evolution and Environment**, pp. 82-3] In his article on
*"Anarchism"* for the **Encyclopaedia Britannica**, Kropotkin stressed
that anarchists *"have endeavoured to promote their ideas directly
amongst the labour organisations and to induce those unions to a direct
struggle against capital, without placing their faith in parliamentary
legislation."* [**Anarchism**, p. 287]

Far from denying the importance of collective class struggle, he
actually stressed it again and again. As he once wrote, *"to make the
revolution, the mass of workers will have to organise themselves.
Resistance and the strike are excellent means of organisation for doing
this."* He argued that it was *"a question of organising societies of
resistance for all trades in each town, of creating resistance funds
against the exploiters, of giving more solidarity to the workers'
organisations of each town and of putting them in contact with those of
other towns, of federating them . . . Workers' solidarity must no longer
be an empty word by practised each day between all trades and all
nations."* [quoted by Cahm, **Op. Cit.**, pp. 255-6]

As can be seen, Kropotkin was well aware of the importance of popular,
mass, struggles. As he put it, anarchists *"know very well that any
popular movement is a step towards the social revolution. It awakens the
spirit of revolt, it makes men [and women] accustomed to seeing the
established order (or rather the established disorder) as eminently
unstable."* [**Words of a Rebel**, p. 203] As regards the social
revolution, he argues that *"a decisive blow will have to be
administered to private property: from the beginning, the workers will
have to proceed to take over all social wealth so as to put it into
common ownership. This revolution can only be carried out by the workers
themselves."* In order to do this, the masses have to build their own
organisation as the *"great mass of workers will not only have to
constitute itself outside the bourgeoisie . . . it will have to take
action of its own during the period which will precede the revolution .
. . and this sort of action can only be carried out when a strong
**workers' organisation** exists."* This meant, of course, it was *"the
mass of workers we have to seek to organise. We . . . have to submerge
ourselves in the organisation of the people . . . When the mass of
workers is organised and we are with it to strengthen its revolutionary
idea, to make the spirit of revolt against capital germinate there . . .
then it will be the social revolution."* [quoted by Caroline Cahm, **Op.
Cit.**, pp. 153-4]

He saw the class struggle in terms of *"a multitude of acts of revolt in
all countries, under all possible conditions: first, individual revolt
against capital and State; then collective revolt - strikes and
working-class insurrections - both preparing, in men's minds as in
actions, a revolt of the masses, a revolution."* Clearly, the mass,
collective nature of social change was not lost on Kropotkin who pointed
to a *"multitude of risings of working masses and peasants"* as a
positive sign. Strikes, he argued, *"were once 'a war of folded arms'"*
but now were *"easily turning to revolt, and sometimes taking the
proportions of vast insurrections."* [**Anarchism**, p. 144]

Kropotkin could not have been clearer. Somewhat ironically, given
Stack's assertions, Kropotkin explicitly opposed the Marxism of his time
(Social Democracy) precisely **because** it had *"moved away from a pure
labour movement, in the sense of a direct struggle against capitalists
by means of strikes, unions, and so forth."* The Marxists, he stated,
opposed strikes and unions because they *"diverted forces from electoral
agitation"* while anarchists *"reject[ed] a narrowly political struggle
[and] inevitably became a more revolutionary party, both in theory and
in practice."* [**The Conquest of Bread and Other Writings**, pp. 207-8,
p. 208 and p. 209]

And Pat Stack argues that Kropotkin did not see *"class conflict as the
dynamic for social change,"* nor *"class conflict"* as *"the motor of
change"* and the working class *"not the agent and collective struggle
not the means"*! Truly incredible and a total and utter distortion of
Kropotkin's ideas on the subject.

As for other anarchists, we discover the same concern over class
conflict, collective struggle and organisation and the awareness of a
mass social revolution by the working class. Emma Goldman, for example,
argued that anarchism *"stands for direct action"* and that *"[t]rade
unionism, the economic area of the modern gladiator, owes its existence
to direct action . . . In France, in Spain, in Italy, in Russian, nay
even in England (witness the growing rebellion of English labour
unions), direct, revolutionary economic action has become so strong a
force in the battle for industrial liberty as to make the world realise
the tremendous importance of labour's power. The General Strike [is] the
supreme expression of the economic consciousness of the workers . . .
Today every great strike, in order to win, must realise the importance
of the solidaric general protest."* [**Anarchism and Other Essays**, pp.
65-6] She placed collective class struggle at the centre of her ideas
and, crucially, she saw it as the way to create an anarchist society:

> *"It is this war of classes that we must concentrate upon, and in that
> connection the war against false values, against evil institutions,
> against all social atrocities. Those who appreciate the urgent need of
> co-operating in great struggles . . . must organise the preparedness
> of the masses for the overthrow of both capitalism and the state.
> Industrial and economic preparedness is what the workers need. That
> alone leads to revolution at the bottom . . . That alone will give the
> people the means to take their children out of the slums, out of the
> sweat shops and the cotton mills . . . That alone leads to economic
> and social freedom, and does away with all wars, all crimes, and all
> injustice."* [**Red Emma Speaks**, pp. 355-6]

For Malatesta, *"the most powerful force for social transformation is
the working class movement . . . Through the organisations established
for the defence of their interests, workers acquire an awareness of the
oppression under which they live and of the antagonisms which divide
them from their employers, and so begin to aspire to a better life, get
used to collective struggle and to solidarity."* This meant that
anarchists *"must recognise the usefulness and importance of the
workers' movement, must favour its development, and make it one of the
levers of their action, doing all they can so that it . . . will
culminate in a social revolution."* Anarchists must *"deepen the chasm
between capitalists and wage-slaves, between rulers and ruled; preach
expropriation of private property and the destruction of State."* The
new society would be organised *"by means of free association and
federations of producers and consumers."* [**Errico Malatesta: His Life
and Ideas**, p. 113, pp. 250-1 and p. 184] Alexander Berkman,
unsurprisingly, argued the same thing. As he put it, only *"the
workers"* as *"the worst victims of present institutions,"* could
abolish capitalism an the state as *"it is to their own interest to
abolish them . . . labour's emancipation means at the same time the
redemption of the whole of society."* He stressed that *"**only the
right organisation of the workers** can accomplish what we are striving
for . . . Organisation from the bottom up, beginning with the shop and
factory, on the foundation of the joint interests of the workers
everywhere . . . alone can solve the labour question and serve the true
emancipation of man[kind]."* [**What is Anarchism?**, p. 187 and p. 207]

As can be seen, the claim that Kropotkin or Bakunin, or anarchists in
general, ignored the class struggle and collective working class
struggle and organisation is either a lie or indicates ignorance.
Clearly, anarchists have placed working class struggle, organisation and
collective direct action and solidarity at the core of their politics
(and as the means of creating a libertarian socialist society) from the
start. Moreover, this perspective is reflected in the anarchist flag
itself as we discuss in our [appendix on the symbols of
anarchism](append2.html). According to Louise Michel the *"black flag is
the flag of strikes."* [**The Red Virgin: Memoirs of Louise Michel**, p.
168] If anarchism does, as some Marxists assert, reject class conflict
and collective struggle then using a flag associated with an action
which expresses both seems somewhat paradoxical. However, for those with
even a basic understanding of anarchism and its history there is no
paradox as anarchism is obviously based on class conflict and collective
struggle.

Also see [section H.2.8](secH2.html#sech28) for a discussion of the
relationship of anarchism to syndicalism.

H.2.3 Does anarchism yearn *"for what has gone before"*?
--------------------------------------------------------

Leninist Pat Stack states that one of the *"key points of divergence"*
between anarchism and Marxism is that the former, *"far from
understanding the advances that capitalism represented, tended to take a
wistful look back. Anarchism shares with Marxism an abhorrence of the
horrors of capitalism, but yearns for what has gone before."* [*"Anarchy
in the UK?"*, **Socialist Review**, no. 246]

Like his other *"key point"* (namely the rejection of class struggle -
see [last section](secH2.html#sech22)), Stack is simply wrong. Even the
quickest look at the works of Proudhon, Bakunin and Kropotkin would
convince the reader that this is simply distortion. Rather than look
backwards for our ideas of social life, anarchists have always been
careful to base our ideas on the current state of society and what
anarchist thinkers considered positive current trends within it.

The dual element of progress is important to remember. Capitalism is a
class society, marked by exploitation, oppression and various social
hierarchies. In such a society progress can hardly be neutral. It will
reflect vested interests, the needs of those in power, the rationales of
the economic system (e.g. the drive for profits) and those who benefit
from it, the differences in power between states and companies and so
on. Equally, it will be shaped by the class struggle, the resistance of
the working classes to exploitation and oppression, the objective needs
of production, etc. As such, trends in society will reflect the various
class conflicts, social hierarchies, power relationships and so on which
exist within it.

This is particularly true of the economy. The development of the
industrial structure of a capitalist economy will be based on the
fundamental need to maximise the profits and power of the capitalists.
As such, it will develop (either by market forces or by state
intervention) in order to ensure this. This means that various
tendencies apparent in capitalist society exist specifically to aid the
development of capital. It does not follow that because a society which
places profits above people has found a specific way of organising
production "efficient" it means that a socialist society will do. As
such, anarchist opposition to specific tendencies within capitalism
(such as the increased concentration and centralisation of companies)
does not mean a *"yearning"* for the past. Rather, it shows an awareness
that capitalist methods are precisely that and that they need not be
suited for a society which replaces the profit system with human and
ecological need as the criteria for decision making.

For anarchists, this means questioning the assumptions of capitalist
progress and so the first task of a revolution after the expropriation
of the capitalists and the destruction of the state will be to transform
the industrial structure and how it operates, not keep it as it is.
Anarchists have long argued that capitalist methods cannot be used for
socialist ends. In our battle to democratise and socialise the
workplace, in our awareness of the importance of collective initiatives
by the direct producers in transforming their work situation, we show
that factories are not merely sites of production, but also of
reproduction - the reproduction of a certain structure of social
relations based on the division between those who give orders and those
who take them. Moreover, the structure of industry has developed to
maximise profits. Why assume that this structure will be equally as
efficient in producing useful products by meaningful work which does not
harm the environment, society or those who do the actual tasks? A
further aspect of this is that many of the struggles today, from the
Zapatistas in Chiapas to those against Genetically Modified (GM) food
and nuclear power are precisely based on the understanding that
capitalist "progress" can not be uncritically accepted. To resist the
expulsion of people from the land in the name of progress or the
introduction of terminator seeds is not to look back to *"what had
gone"*, although this is also precisely what the proponents of
capitalist globalisation often accuse us of. Rather, it is to put
***"people before profit."***

That so many Marxists fail to understand this suggests that their
ideology subscribes to notions of "progress" which simply builds upon
capitalist ones. As such, only a sophist would confuse a critical
evaluation of trends within capitalism with a yearning for the past. It
means to buy into the whole capitalist notion of "progress" which has
always been part of justifying the inhumanities of the status quo.
Simply put, just because a process is rewarded by the profit driven
market it does not mean that it makes sense from a human or ecological
perspective. For example, as we argue in [section
J.5.11](secJ5.html#secj511), the capitalist market hinders the spread of
co-operatives and workers' self-management in spite of their well
documented higher efficiency and productivity. From the perspective of
the needs of the capitalists, this makes perfect sense. In terms of the
workers and efficient allocation and use of resources, it does not.
Would Marxists argue that because co-operatives and workers'
self-management of production are marginal aspects of the capitalist
economy it means that they will play no part in a sane society or that
if a socialist expresses interest in them it means that are *"yearning"*
for a past mode of production? We hope not.

This common Marxist failure to understand anarchist investigations of
the future is, ironically enough, joined with a total failure to
understand the social conditions in which anarchists have put forward
their ideas. For all his claims that anarchists ignore *"material
conditions,"* it is Pat Stack (and others like him) who does so in his
claims against Proudhon. Stack calls the Frenchman *"the founder of
modern anarchism"* and states that Marx dubbed Proudhon *"the socialist
of the small peasant or master craftsman."* Typically, Stack gets even
this wrong as it was Engels who used those words, although Marx would
probably have not disagreed if he had been alive when they were penned.
[**The Marx-Engels Reader**, p. 626] From this, Stack implies that
Proudhon was *"yearning for the past"* when he advanced his mutualist
ideas.

Nothing, however, could be further from the truth. This is because the
society in which the French anarchist lived was predominately artisan
and peasant in nature. This was admitted by Marx and Engels in the
**Communist Manifesto** (*"[i]n countries like France"* the peasants
*"constitute far more than half of the population."* [**Op. Cit.**, p.
493]). As such, for Proudhon to incorporate the aspirations of the
majority of the population is not to *"yearn for what has gone before"*
but rather an extremely sensible position to take. This suggests that
for Engels to state that the French anarchist was *"the socialist of the
small peasant or master craftsman"* was unsurprising, a simple statement
of fact, as the French working classes were, at the time, predominately
small peasants or master craftsmen (or artisans). It, in other words,
reflected the society Proudhon lived in and, as such, did not reflect
desires for the past but rather a wish to end exploitation and
oppression **now** rather than some unspecified time in the future.

Moreover, Proudhon's ideas cannot be limited to just that as Marxists
try to do. As K. Steven Vincent points out Proudhon's *"social theories
may not be reduced to a socialism for only the peasant class, nor was it
a socialism only for the petite bourgeois; it was a socialism of and for
French workers. And in the mid-nineteenth century . . . most French
workers were still artisans."* Indeed, *"[w]hile Marx was correct in
predicting the eventual predominance of the industrial proletariat
vis-à-vis skilled workers, such predominance was neither obvious nor a
foregone conclusion in France during the nineteenth century. The
absolute number of small industries even increased during most of the
century."* [**Pierre-Joseph Proudhon and the Rise of French Republican
Socialism**, p. 5 and p. 282] Proudhon himself noted in 1851 that of a
population of 36 million, 24 million were peasants and 6 million were
artisans. Of the remaining 6 million, these included wage-workers for
whom *"workmen's associations"* would be essential as *"a protest
against the wage system,"* the *"denial of the rule of capitalists"* and
for *"the management of large instruments of labour."* [**The General
Idea of the Revolution**, pp. 97-8]

To summarise, if the society in which you live is predominately made-up
of peasants and artisans then it is hardly an insult to be called *"the
socialist of the small peasant or master craftsman."* Equally, it can
hardly represent a desire for *"what has gone before"* to tailor your
ideas to the actual conditions in the country in which you live! And
Stack accuses **anarchists** of ignoring *"material conditions"*!

Neither can it be said that Proudhon ignored the development of
industrialisation in France during his lifetime. Quite the reverse, in
fact, as indicated above. Proudhon did **not** ignore the rise of
large-scale industry and argued that such industry should be managed by
the workers' themselves via workers associations. As he put it,
*"certain industries"* required *"the combined employment of a large
number of workers"* and so the producer is *"a collectivity."* In such
industries *"we have no choice"* and so *"it is necessary to form an
**association** among the workers"* because *"without that they would
remain related as subordinates and superiors, and there would ensue two
industrial castes of masters and wage-workers, which is repugnant to a
free and democratic society."* [**Op. Cit.**, pp. 215-6] Even Engels had
to grudgingly admit that Proudhon supported *"the association of
workers"* for *"large-industry and large establishments, such as
railways."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 626]

All in all, Stack is simply showing his ignorance of both Proudhon's
ideas **and** the society (the *"material conditions"*) in which they
were shaped and were aimed for. As can be seen, Proudhon incorporated
the development of large-scale industry within his mutualist ideas and
so the need to abolish wage labour by workers' associations and workers'
control of production. Perhaps Stack can fault Proudhon for seeking the
end of capitalism too soon and for not waiting patiently will it
developed further (if he does, he will also have to attack Marx, Lenin
and Trotsky as well for the same failing!), but this has little to do
with *"yearn[ing] for what has gone before."*

After distorting Proudhon's ideas on industry, Stack does the same with
Bakunin. He asserts the following:

**

> "Similarly, the Russian anarchist leader Bakunin argued that it was
> the progress of capitalism that represented the fundamental problem.
> For him industrialisation was an evil. He believed it had created a
> decadent western Europe, and therefore had held up the more primitive,
> less industrialised Slav regions as the hope for change."

Now, it would be extremely interesting to find out where, exactly, Stack
discovered that Bakunin made these claims. After all, they are at such
odds with Bakunin's anarchist ideas that it is temping to conclude that
Stack is simply making it up. This, we suggest, explains the total lack
of references for such an outrageous claim. Looking at what appears to
be his main source, we discover Paul Avrich writing that *"[i]n 1848"*
(i.e. nearly 20 years **before** Bakunin became an anarchist!) Bakunin
*"spoke of the decadence of Western Europe and saw hope in the
primitive, less industrialised Slavs for the regeneration of the
Continent."* [**Anarchist Portraits**, p. 8] The plagiarism is obvious,
as are the distortions. Given that Bakunin became an anarchist in the
mid-1860s, how his pre-anarchist ideas are relevant to an evaluation of
anarchism escapes logic. It makes as much sense as quoting Marx to
refute fascism as Mussolini was originally the leader of the left-wing
of the Italian Socialist Party!

It is, of course, simple to refute Stack's claims. We need only do that
which he does not, namely quote Bakunin. For someone who thought
*"industrialisation was an evil,"* a key aspect of Bakunin's ideas on
social revolution was the seizing of industry and its placing under
social ownership. As he put it, *"capital and all tools of labour belong
to the city workers - to the workers associations. The whole
organisation of the future should be nothing but a free federation of
workers - agricultural workers as well as factory workers and
associations of craftsmen."* [**The Political Philosophy of Bakunin**,
p. 410] Bakunin argued that *"to destroy . . . all the instruments of
labour . . . would be to condemn all humanity - which is infinity too
numerous today to exist . . . on the simple gifts of nature . . . - to .
. . death by starvation. Thus capital cannot and must not be destroyed.
It must be preserved."* Only when workers *"obtain not individual but
**collective** property in capital"* and when capital is no longer
*"concentrated in the hands of a separate, exploiting class"* will they
be able *"to smash the tyranny of capital."* [**The Basic Bakunin**, pp.
90-1] He stressed that only *"associated labour, this is labour
organised upon the principles of reciprocity and co-operation, is
adequate to the task of maintaining the existence of a large and
somewhat civilised society."* Moreover, the *"whole secret of the
boundless productivity of human labour consists first of all in applying
. . . scientifically developed reason . . . and then in the division of
that labour."* [**The Political Philosophy of Bakunin**, pp. 341-2]
Hardly the thoughts of someone opposed to industrialisation!
Unsurprisingly, then, Eugene Pyziu noted that *"[i]n an article printed
in 1868 [Bakunin] rejected outright the doctrine of the rottenness of
the West and of the messianic destiny of Russia."* [**The Doctrine of
Anarchism of Michael A. Bakunin**, p. 61]

Rather than oppose industrialisation and urge the destruction of
industry, Bakunin considered one of the first acts of the revolution
would be workers' associations taking over the means of production and
turning them into collective property managed by the workers themselves.
Hence Daniel Guérin's comment:

> *"Proudhon and Bakunin were 'collectivists,' which is to say they
> declared themselves without equivocation in favour of the common
> exploitation, not by the State but by associated workers of the
> large-scale means of production and of the public services. Proudhon
> has been quite wrongly presented as an exclusive enthusiast of private
> property."* [*"From Proudhon to Bakunin"*, pp. 23-33, **The Radical
> Papers**, Dimitrios I. Roussopoulos (ed.), p. 32]

Clearly, Stack does not have the faintest idea of what he is talking
about! Nor is Kropotkin any safer than Proudhon or Bakunin from Stack's
distortions:

> *"Peter Kropotkin, another famous anarchist leader to emerge in
> Russia, also looked backwards for change. He believed the ideal
> society would be based on small autonomous communities, devoted to
> small scale production. He had witnessed such communities among
> Siberian peasants and watchmakers in the Swiss mountains."*

First, we must note the plagiarism. Stack is summarising Paul Avrich's
summary of Kropotkin's ideas. [**Op. Cit.**, p. 62] Rather than go to
the source material, Stack provides an interpretation of someone else's
interpretation of someone else's ideas! Clearly, the number of links in
the chain means that something is going to get lost in the process and,
of course, it does. The something which "gets lost" is, unfortunately,
Kropotkin's ideas.

Ultimately, Stack is simply showing his total ignorance of Kropotkin's
ideas by making such a statement. At least Avrich expanded upon his
summary to mention that Kropotkin's positive evaluation of using modern
technology and the need to apply it on an appropriate level to make work
and the working environment as pleasant as possible. As Avrich
summarises, *"[p]laced in small voluntary workshops, machinery would
rescue human beings from the monotony and toil of large-scale capitalist
enterprise, allow time for leisure and cultural pursuits, and remove
forever the stamp of inferiority traditionally borne by manual labour."*
[**Op. Cit.**, p. 63] Hardly *"backward looking"* to desire the
application of science and technology to transform the industrial system
into one based on the needs of people rather than profit!

Stack must be hoping that the reader has, like himself, not read
Kropotkin's classic work **Fields, Factories and Workshops** for if they
have then they would be aware of the distortion Stack subjects
Kropotkin's ideas to. While Avrich does present, in general, a
reasonable summary of Kropotkin's ideas, he does place it into a
framework of his own making. Kropotkin while stressing the importance of
decentralising industry within a free society did not look backward for
his inspiration. Rather, he looked to trends within existing society,
trends he thought pointed in an anti-capitalist direction. This can be
seen from the fact he based his ideas on detailed analysis of current
developments in the economy and came to the conclusion that industry
would spread across the global (which has happened) and that small
industries will continue to exist side by side with large ones (which
also has been confirmed). From these facts he argued that a socialist
society would aim to decentralise production, combining agriculture with
industry and both using modern technology to the fullest. This was
possible only after a social revolution which expropriated industry and
the land and placed social wealth into the hands of the producers. Until
then, the positive trends he saw in modern society would remain
circumcised by the workings of the capitalist market and the state.

As we discuss the fallacy that Kropotkin (or anarchists in general) have
argued for *"small autonomous communities, devoted to small scale
production"* in [section I.3.8](secI3.html#seci38), we will not do so
here. Suffice to say, he did not, as is often asserted, argue for
*"small-scale production"* (he still saw the need for factories, for
example) but rather for production geared to ***appropriate*** levels,
based on the objective needs of production (without the distorting
effects generated by the needs of capitalist profits and power) and, of
necessity, the needs of those who work in and live alongside industry
(and today we would add, the needs of the environment). In other words,
the transformation of capitalism into a society human beings could live
full and meaningful lives in. Part of this would involve creating an
industry based on human needs. *"Have the factory and the workshop at
the gates of your fields and gardens and work in them,"* he argued.
*"Not those large establishments, of course, in which huge masses of
metals have to be dealt with and which are better placed at certain
spots indicated by Nature, but the countless variety of workshops and
factories which are required to satisfy the infinite diversity of tastes
among civilised men [and women]."* The new factories and workplaces
would be *"airy and hygienic, and consequently economical, . . . in
which human life is of more account than machinery and the making of
extra profits."* [**Fields, Factories and Workshops Tomorrow**, p. 197]
Under capitalism, he argued, the whole discourse of economics (like
industrial development itself) was based on the logic and rationale of
the profit motive:

> "Under the name of profits, rent and interest upon capital, surplus
> value, and the like, economists have eagerly discussed the benefits
> which the owners of land or capital, or some privileged nations, can
> derive, either from the under-paid work of the wage-labourer, or from
> the inferior position of one class of the community towards another
> class, or from the inferior economical development of one nation
> towards another nation. . .
> "In the meantime the great question - 'What have we to produce, and
> how?' necessarily remained in the background . . . The main subject of
> social economy - that is, the **economy of energy required for the
> satisfaction of human needs** - is consequently the last subject which
> one expects to find treated in a concrete form in economical
> treatises." [**Op. Cit.**, p. 17]

Kropotkin's ideas were, therefore, an attempt to discuss how a
post-capitalist society could develop, based on an extensive
investigation of current trends within capitalism, and reflecting the
needs which capitalism ignores. To fetishise big industry, as Leninists
tend to do, means locking socialism itself into the logic of capitalism
and, by implication, sees a socialist society which will basically be
the same as capitalism, using the technology, industrial structure and
industry developed under class society without change (see [section
H.3.12](secH3.html#sech312)). Rather than condemn Kropotkin, Stack's
comments (and those like them) simply show the poverty of the Leninist
critique of capitalism and its vision of the socialist future.

All in all, anyone who claims that anarchism is *"backward looking"* or
*"yearns for the past"* simply has no idea what they are talking about.

H.2.4 Do anarchists think *"the state is the main enemy"*?
----------------------------------------------------------

Pat Stack argues that *"the idea that dominates anarchist thought"* is
*"that the state is the main enemy, rather than identifying the state as
one aspect of a class society that has to be destroyed."* [*"Anarchy in
the UK?"*, **Socialist Review**, no. 246] Marxist Paul Thomas states
that *"Anarchists insist that the basis source of social injustice is
the state."* [**Karl Marx and the Anarchists**, p. 2]

On the face of it, such assertions make little sense. After all, was not
the first work by the first self-declared anarchist called **What is
Property?** and contained the revolutionary maxim ***"property is
theft"***? Surely this fact alone would be enough to put to rest the
notion that anarchists view the state as the main problem in the world?
Obviously not. Flying in the face of this well known fact as well as
anarchist theory, Marxists have constantly repeated the falsehood that
anarchists consider the state as the main enemy. Indeed, Stack and
Thomas are simply repeating an earlier assertion by Engels:

> *"Bakunin has a peculiar theory of his own, a medley of Proudhonism
> and communism. The chief point concerning the former is that he does
> not regard capital, i.e. the class antagonism between capitalists and
> wage workers which has arisen through social development, but the
> **state** as the main enemy to be abolished . . . our view [is] that
> state power is nothing more than the organisation which the ruling
> classes - landowners and capitalists - have provided for themselves in
> order to protect their social privileges, Bakunin maintains that it is
> the **state** which has created capital, that the capitalist has his
> capital **only be the grace of the state.** As, therefore, the state
> is the chief evil, it is above all the state which must be done away
> with and then capitalism will go to blazes of itself. We, on the
> contrary, say: Do away with capital, the concentration of all means of
> production in the hands of a few, and the state will fall of itself.
> The difference is an essential one . . . the abolition of capital
> **is** precisely the social revolution."* [Marx, Engels and Lenin,
> **Anarchism and Anarcho-Syndicalism**, p. 71]

As will come as no surprise, Engels did not bother to indicate where he
discovered Bakunin's ideas on these matters. Similarly, his followers
raise this kind of assertion as a truism, apparently without the need
for evidence to support the claim. This is hardly surprising as
anarchists, including Bakunin, have expressed an idea distinctly at odds
with Engels' claims, namely that the social revolution would be marked
by the abolition of capitalism and the state at the same time. That this
is the case can be seen from John Stuart Mill who, unlike Engels, saw
that Bakunin's ideas meant *"not only the annihilation of all
government, but getting all property of all kinds out of the hands of
the possessors to be used for the general benefit."* [*"Chapters on
Socialism,"* **Principles of Political Economy**, p. 376] If the great
liberal thinker could discern this aspect of anarchism, why not Engels?

After all, this vision of a **social** revolution (i.e. one that
combined political, social **and** economic goals) occurred continuously
throughout Bakunin's writings when he was an anarchist. Indeed, to claim
that he, or anarchists in general, just opposed the state suggests a
total unfamiliarity with anarchist theory. For Bakunin, like all
anarchists, the abolition of the state occurs at the same time as the
abolition of capital. This joint abolition **is** precisely the social
revolution. As one academic put it:

> *"In Bakunin's view, the struggle against the main concentration of
> power in society, the state, was **no less necessary** than the
> struggle against capital. Engels, however, puts the matter somewhat
> differently, arguing that for Bakunin the state was the main enemy, as
> if Bakunin had not held that capital, too, was an enemy and that its
> expropriation was a necessary even if not sufficient condition for the
> social revolution . . . [Engels'] formulation . . . distorts Bakunin's
> argument, which also held capital to be an evil necessary to abolish"*
> [Alvin W. Gouldner, *"Marx's Last Battle: Bakunin and the First
> International"*, pp. 853-884, **Theory and Society**, Vol. 11, No. 6,
> pp. 863-4]

In 1865, for example, we discover Bakunin arguing that anarchists *"seek
the destruction of all States"* in his *"Program of the Brotherhood."*
Yet he also argued that a member of this association *"must be
socialist"* and see that *"labour"* was the *"sole producer of social
assets"* and so *"anyone enjoying these without working is an exploiter
of another man's labour, a thief."* They must also *"understand that
there is no liberty in the absence of equality"* and so the *"attainment
of the widest liberty"* is possible only *"amid the most perfect (de
jure and de facto) political, economic and social equality."* The *"sole
and supreme objective"* of the revolution *"will be the effective
political, economic and social emancipation of the people."* This was
because political liberty *"is not feasible without political equality.
And the latter is impossible without economic and social equality."*
This means that the *"land belongs to everyone. But usufruct of it will
belong only to those who till it with their own hands."* As regards
industry, *"through the unaided efforts and economic powers of the
workers' associations, capital and the instruments of labour will pass
into the possession of those who will apply them . . . through their own
labours."* He opposed sexism, for women are *"equal in all political and
social rights."* Ultimately, *"[n]o revolution could succeed . . .
unless it was simultaneously a political and a social revolution. Any
exclusively political revolution . . . will, insofar as it consequently
does not have the immediate, effective, political and economic
emancipation of the people as its primary objective, prove to be . . .
illusory, phoney."* [**No Gods, No Masters**, vol. 1, pp. 134-41]

In 1868, Bakunin was arguing the same ideas. The *"Association of the
International Brethren seeks simultaneously universal, social,
philosophical, economic and political revolution, so that the present
order of things, rooted in property, exploitation, domination and the
authority principle"* will be destroyed. The *"revolution as we
understand it will . . . set about the . . . complete destruction of the
State . . . The natural and necessary upshot of that destruction"* will
include the *"[d]issolution of the army, magistracy, bureaucracy, police
and clergy"* and *"[a]ll productive capital and instruments of labour .
. . be[ing] confiscated for the benefit of toilers associations, which
will have to put them to use in collective production"* as well as the
*"[s]eizure of all Church and State properties."* The *"federated
Alliance of all labour associations . . . will constitute the Commune."*
The people *"must make the revolution everywhere, and . . . ultimate
direction of it must at all times be vested in the people organised into
a free federation of agricultural and industrial associations . . .
organised from the bottom up."* [**Op. Cit.**, pp. 152-6]

As these the words of a person who considered the state as the *"chief
evil"* or *"that the state is the main enemy"*? Of course not, rather
Bakunin clearly identified the state as one aspect of a class society
that has to be destroyed. As he put it, the *"State, which has never had
any task other than to regularise, sanction and . . . protect the rule
of the privileged classes and exploitation of the people's labour for
the rich, must be abolished. Consequently, this requires that society be
organised from the bottom up through the free formation and free
federation of worker associations, industrial, agricultural, scientific
and artisan alike, . . . founded upon collective ownership of the land,
capital, raw materials and the instruments of labour, which is to say,
all large-scale property . . . leaving to private and hereditary
possession only those items that are actually for personal use."* [**Op.
Cit.**, p. 182] Clearly, as Wayne Thorpe notes, for Bakunin *"[o]nly the
simultaneous destruction of the state and of the capitalist system,
accompanied by the organisation from below of a federalist system of
administration based upon labour's economic associations . . . could
achieve true liberty."* [**"The Workers Themselves"**, p. 6]

Rather than seeing the state as the main evil to be abolished, Bakunin
always stressed that a revolution must be economic **and** political in
nature, that it must ensure political, economic and social liberty and
equality. As such, he argued for **both** the destruction of the state
and the expropriation of capital (both acts conducted, incidentally, by
a federation of workers' associations or workers' councils). While the
apparatus of the state was being destroyed (*"Dissolution of the army,
magistracy, bureaucracy, police and clergy"*), capitalism was also being
uprooted and destroyed (*"All productive capital and instruments of
labour . . . confiscated for the benefit of toilers associations"*). To
assert, as Engels did, that Bakunin ignored the necessity of abolishing
capitalism and the other evils of the current system while focusing
exclusively on the state, is simply distorting his ideas. As Mark Leier
summarises in his excellent biography of Bakunin, Engels *"was just
flat-out wrong . . . What Bakunin did argue was that the social
revolution had to be launched against the state and capitalism
simultaneously, for the two reinforced each other."* [**Bakunin: The
Creative Passion**, p. 274]

Kropotkin, unsurprisingly, argued along identical lines as Bakunin. He
stressed that *"the revolution will burn on until it has accomplished
its mission: the abolition of property-owning and of the State."* This
revolution, he re-iterated, would be a *"mass rising up against property
and the State."* Indeed, Kropotkin always stressed that *"there is one
point to which all socialists adhere: the expropriation of capital must
result from the coming revolution."* This mean that *"the area of
struggle against capital, and against the sustainer of capital -
government"* could be one in which *"various groups can act in
agreement"* and so *"any struggle that prepares for that expropriation
should be sustained in unanimity by all the socialist groups, to
whatever shading they belong."* [**Words of a Rebel**, p. 75 and p. 204]
Little wonder Kropotkin wrote his famous article *"Expropriation"* on
this subject! As he put it:

> *"Expropriation - that is the guiding word of the coming revolution,
> without which it will fail in its historic mission: the complete
> expropriation of all those who have the means of exploiting human
> beings; the return to the community of the nation of everything that
> in the hands of anyone can be used to exploit others."* [**Op. Cit.**,
> pp. 207-8]

This was because he was well aware of the oppressive nature of
capitalism: *"For the worker who **must sell** his labour, it is
impossible to remain **free**, and it is precisely because it is
impossible that we are anarchists and communists."* [**Selected Writings
on Anarchism and Revolution**, p. 305] For Kropotkin, *"the task we
impose ourselves"* is to acquire *"sufficient influence to induce the
workmen to avail themselves of the first opportunity of taking
possession of land and the mines, of railways and factories,"* to bring
working class people *"to the conviction that they must reply on
themselves to get rid of the oppression of Capital."* [**Act for
Yourselves**, p. 32] Strange words if Marxist assertions were true. As
can be seen, Kropotkin is simply following Bakunin's ideas on the
matter. He, like Bakunin, was well aware of the evils of capitalism and
that the state protects these evils.

Unsurprisingly, he called anarchism *"the no-government system of
socialism."* [**Anarchism**, p. 46] For Kropotkin, the *"State is there
to protect exploitation, speculation and private property; it is itself
the by-product of the rapine of the people. The proletariat must rely on
his own hands; he can expect nothing of the State. It is nothing more
than an organisation devised to hinder emancipation at all costs."*
[**Words of a Rebel**, p. 27] Rather than see the state as the main
evil, he clearly saw it as the protector of capitalism - in other words,
as one aspect of a class system which needed to be replaced by a better
society:

> *"The very words Anarchist-Communism show in what direction society,
> in our opinion, is already going, and one what lines it can get rid of
> the oppressive powers of Capital and Government . . . The first
> conviction to acquire is that nothing short of expropriation on a vast
> scale, carried out by the workmen themselves, can be the first step
> towards a reorganisation of our production on Socialist principles."*
> [Kropotkin, **Act for Yourselves**, pp. 32-3]

Similarly with all other anarchists. Emma Goldman, for example,
summarised for all anarchists when she argued that anarchism *"really
stands for"* the *"liberation of the human body from the domination of
property; liberation from the shackles and restraint of government."*
Goldman was well aware that wealth *"means power; the power to subdue,
to crush, to exploit, the power to enslave, to outrage, to degrade."*
She considered property *"not only a hindrance to human well-being, but
an obstacle, a deadly barrier, to all progress."* A key problem of
modern society was that *"man must sell his labour"* and so *"his
inclination and judgement are subordinated to the will of a master."*
Anarchism, she stressed, was the *"the only philosophy that can and will
do away with this humiliating and degrading situation . . . There can be
no freedom in the large sense of the word . . . so long as mercenary and
commercial considerations play an important part in the determination of
personal conduct."* The state, ironically for Stack's claim, was
*"necessary **only** to maintain or protect property and monopoly."*
[**Red Emma Speaks**, p. 73, p. 66, p. 50 and p. 51]

Errico Malatesta, likewise, stressed that, for *"all anarchists,"* it
was definitely a case that the *"abolition of political power is not
possible without the simultaneous destruction of economic privilege."*
The *"Anarchist Programme"* he drafted listed *"Abolition of private
property"* before *"Abolition of government"* and argued that *"the
present state of society"* was one in *"which some have inherited the
land and all social wealth, while the mass of the people, disinherited
in all respects, is exploited and oppressed by a small possessing
class."* It ends by arguing that anarchism wants *"the complete
destruction of the domination and exploitation of man by man"* and for
*"expropriation of landowners and capitalists for the benefit of all;
and the abolition of government."* [**Errico Malatesta: His Life and
Ideas**, p. 158, p. 184, p. 183, p. 197 and p. 198] Nearly three decades
previously, we find Malatesta arguing the same idea. As he put it in
1891, anarchists *"struggle for anarchy, and for socialism, because we
believe that anarchy and socialism must be realised immediately, that is
to say that in the revolutionary act we must drive government away,
abolish property . . . human progress is measured by the extent
government power and private property are reduced."* [**Anarchy**, p.
54]

Little wonder Bertrand Russell stated that anarchism *"is associated
with belief in the communal ownership of land and capital"* because,
like Marxism, it has the *"perception that private capital is a source
of tyranny by certain individuals over others."* [**Roads to Freedom**,
p. 40] Russell was, of course, simply pointing out the obvious. As Brian
Morris correctly summarises:

> *"Another criticism of anarchism is that it has a narrow view of
> politics: that it sees the state as the fount of all evil, ignoring
> other aspects of social and economic life. This is a misrepresentation
> of anarchism. It partly derives from the way anarchism has been
> defined, and partly because Marxist historians have tried to exclude
> anarchism from the broader socialist movement. But when one examines
> the writings of classical anarchists. . . as well as the character of
> anarchist movements. . . it is clearly evident that it has never had
> this limited vision. It has always challenged all forms of authority
> and exploitation, and has been equally critical of capitalism and
> religion as it has been of the state."* [*"Anthropology and
> Anarchism,"* pp. 35-41, **Anarchy: A Journal of Desire Armed**, no.
> 45, p, p. 40]

All in all, Marxist claims that anarchists view the state as the *"chief
evil"* or see the destruction of the state as the *"main idea"* of
anarchism are simply talking nonsense. In fact, rather than anarchists
having a narrow view of social liberation, it is, in fact, Marxists who
do so. By concentrating almost exclusively on the (economic) class
source of exploitation, they blind themselves to other forms of
exploitation and domination that can exist independently of (economic)
class relationships. This can be seen from the amazing difficulty that
many of them got themselves into when trying to analyse the Stalinist
regime in Russia. Anarchists are well aware that the state is just one
aspect of the current class system but unlike Marxists we recognise that
*"class rule must be placed in the much **larger** context of hierarchy
and domination as a whole."* [Murray Bookchin, **The Ecology of
Freedom**, p. 28] This has been the anarchist position from the
nineteenth century onwards and one which is hard not to recognise if you
are at all familiar with the anarchist movement and its theory. As one
historian notes, we have never been purely anti-state, but also
anti-capitalist and opposed to all forms of oppression:

> *"Anarchism rejected capitalism . . . not only because it viewed it as
> inimical to social equality, but also because it saw it as a form of
> domination detrimental to individual freedom. Its basic tenet regarded
> hierarchical authority - be it the state, the church, the economic
> elite, or patriarchy - as unnecessary and deleterious to the
> maximisation of human potential."* [Jose Moya, **Italians in Buenos
> Aires's Anarchist Movement**, p. 197]

So we oppose the state because it is just one aspect of a class ridden
and hierarchical system. We just recognise that all the evils of that
system must be destroyed at the same time to ensure a **social**
revolution rather than just a change in who the boss is.

H.2.5 Do anarchists think *"full blown"* socialism will be created overnight?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Another area in which Marxists misrepresent anarchism is in the
assertion that anarchists believe a completely socialist society (an
ideal or *"utopian"* society, in other words) can be created
*"overnight."* As Marxist Bertell Ollman puts it, *"[u]nlike
anarcho-communists, none of us [Marxists] believe that communism will
emerge full blown from a socialist revolution. Some kind of transition
and period of indeterminate length for it to occur are required."*
[Bertell Ollman (ed.), **Market Socialism: The Debate among
Socialists**, p. 177] This assertion, while it is common, fails to
understand the anarchist vision of revolution. We consider it a
**process** and not an event: *"By revolution we do not mean just the
insurrectionary act."* [Malatesta, **Errico Malatesta: His Life and
Ideas**, p. 156]

Once this is understood, the idea that anarchists think a *"full blown"*
anarchist society will be created *"overnight"* is a fallacy. As Murray
Bookchin pointed out, *"Bakunin, Kropotkin, Malatesta were not so naive
as to believe that anarchism could be established overnight. In imputing
this notion to Bakunin, Marx and Engels wilfully distorted the Russian
anarchist's views."* [**Post-Scarcity Anarchism**, p. 137] Indeed,
Kropotkin stressed that anarchists *"do not believe that in any country
the Revolution will be accomplished at a stroke, in the twinkling of a
eye, as some socialists dream."* Moreover, *"[n]o fallacy more harmful
has ever been spread than the fallacy of a 'One-day Revolution.'"*
[**The Conquest of Bread**, p. 81] Bakunin argued that a *"more or less
prolonged transitional period"* would *"naturally follow in the wake of
the great social crisis"* implied by social revolution. [**The Political
Philosophy of Bakunin**, p. 412] The question, therefore, is not whether
there will be a *"transitional"* society after a revolution but what
**kind** of transition will it be.

So anarchists are aware that a *"full blown"* communist society will not
come about immediately. Rather, the creation of such a society will be a
**process** which the revolution will start off. As Alexander Berkman
put it in his classic introduction to communist-anarchist ideas *"you
must not confuse the social revolution with anarchy. Revolution, in some
of its stages, is a violent upheaval; anarchy is a social condition of
freedom and peace. The revolution is the **means** of bringing anarchy
about but it is not anarchy itself. It is to pave the road for anarchy,
to establish conditions which will make a life of liberty possible."*
However, the *"end shapes the means"* and so *"to achieve its purpose
the revolution must be imbued with and directed by the anarchist spirit
and ideas . . . the social revolution must be anarchist in method as in
aim."* [**What is Anarchism?**, p. 231]

Berkman also acknowledged that *"full blown"* communism was not likely
after a successful revolution. *"Of course,"* he argued, *"when the
social revolution has become thoroughly organised and production is
functioning normally there will be enough for everybody. But in the
first stages of the revolution, during the process of re-construction,
we must take care to supply the people as best we can, and equally,
which means rationing."* Clearly, in such circumstances *"full blown"*
communism would be impossible and, unsurprisingly, Berkman argued that
would not exist. However, the principles that inspire communism and
anarchism could be applied immediately. This meant that both the state
and capitalism would be abolished. While arguing that *"[t]here is no
other way of securing economic equality, which alone is liberty"* than
communist anarchism, he also stated that it is *"likely . . . that a
country in social revolution may try various economic experiments . . .
different countries and regions will probably try out various methods,
and by practical experience learn the best way. The revolution is at the
same time the opportunity and justification for it."* Rather than
*"dictate to the future, to prescribe its mode of conduct"*, Berkman
argued that his *"purpose is to suggest, in board outline the principles
which must animate the revolution, the general lines of action it should
follow if it is to accomplish its aim - the reconstruction of society on
a foundation of freedom and equality."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 215 and p.
230]

Malatesta argued along similar lines. While urging the *"complete
destruction of the domination and exploitation of man by man"* by the
*"expropriation of landlords and capitalists for the benefit of all"*
and *"the abolition of government,"* he recognised that in *"the
post-revolutionary period, in the period of reorganisation and
transition, there might be 'offices for the concentration and
distribution of the capital of collective enterprises', that there might
or might not be titles recording the work done and the quantity of goods
to which one is entitled."* However, he stressed that this *"is
something we shall have to wait and see about, or rather, it is a
problem which will have many and varied solutions according to the
system of production and distribution which will prevail in the
different localities and among the many . . . groupings that will
exist."* He argued that while, eventually, all groups of workers
(particularly the peasants) will *"understand the advantages of
communism or at least of the direct exchange of goods for goods,"* this
may not happen *"in a day."* If some kind of money was used, then people
should *"ensure that [it] truly represents the useful work performed by
its possessors"* rather than being that *"powerful means of exploitation
and oppression"* is currently is. [**Errico Malatesta: His Life and
Ideas**, pp. 198-9 and pp. 100-1] Emma Goldman, also, saw *"a society
based on voluntary co-operation of productive groups, communities and
societies loosely federated together, eventually developing into a free
communism, actuated by a solidarity of interests."* [**Red Emma
Speaks**, p. 50]

So rather than seeing a *"full blown"* communist society appearing
instantly from a revolution, anarcho-communists see a period of
transition in which the degree of communism in a given community or area
is dependent on the objective conditions facing it. This period of
transition would see different forms of social experimentation but the
desire is to see libertarian communist principles as the basis of as
much of this experimentation as possible. To claim that
anarcho-communists ignore reality and see communism as being created
overnight is simply a distortion of their ideas. Rather, they are aware
that the development towards communism is dependent on local conditions,
conditions which can only be overcome in time and by the liberated
community re-organising production and extending it as required. Thus we
find Malatesta arguing 1884 that communism could be brought about
immediately only in a very limited number of areas and, *"for the
rest,"* collectivism would have to be accepted *"for a transitional
period."* This was because, *"[f]or communism to be possible, a high
stage of moral development is required of the members of society, a
sense of solidarity both elevated and profound, which the upsurge of the
revolution may not suffice to induce. This doubt is the more justified
in that material conditions favourable to this development will not
exist at the beginning."* [quoted by Daniel Guérin, **Anarchism**, p.
51]

Clearly, our argument contradicts the widely held view that anarchists
believed an utopian world would be created instantly after a revolution.
Of course, by asserting that anarchists think *"full blown communism"*
will occur without some form of transitional period, Marxists paint a
picture of anarchism as simply utopian, a theory which ignores objective
reality in favour of wishful thinking. However, as seen above, such is
not the case. Anarchists are aware that *"full blown communism"* is
dependent on objective conditions and, therefore, cannot be implemented
until those conditions are meet. Until such time as the objective
conditions are reached, various means of distributing goods, organising
and managing production, and so on will be tried. Such schemes will be
based as far as possible on communistic principles.

Such a period of transition would be based on libertarian and communist
principles. The organisation of society would be anarchist - the state
would be abolished and replaced by a free federation of workers and
community associations. The economic structure would be socialist -
production would be based on self-managed workplaces and the principles
of distribution would be as communistic as possible under the given
objective conditions.

It also seems strange for Marxists to claim that anarchists thought a
*"full blown"* communist society was possible *"overnight"* given that
anarchists had always noted the difficulties facing a social revolution.
Kropotkin, for example, continually stressed that a revolution would
face extensive economic disruption. In his words:

> *"A political revolution can be accomplished without shaking the
> foundations of industry, but a revolution where the people lay hands
> upon property will inevitably paralyse exchange and production . . .
> This point cannot be too much insisted upon; the reorganisation of
> industry on a new basis . . . cannot be accomplished in a few days;
> nor, on the other hand, will people submit to be half starved for
> years in order to oblige the theorists who uphold the wage system. To
> tide over the period of stress they will demand what they have always
> demanded in such cases - communisation of supplies - the giving of
> rations."* [**The Conquest of Bread**, pp. 72-3]

The basic principles of this "transition" period would, therefore, be
based on the *"socialising of production, consumption and exchange."*
The state would be abolished and *"federated Communes"* would be
created. The end of capitalism would be achieved by the
*"expropriation"* of *"everything that enables any man - be he
financier, mill-owner, or landlord - - to appropriate the product of
others' toil."* Distribution of goods would be based on *"no stint or
limit to what the community possesses in abundance, but equal sharing
and dividing of those commodities which are scare or apt to run short."*
[**Op. Cit.**, p. 136, p. 61 and p. 76] Clearly, while not *"full
blown"* communism by any means, such a regime does lay the ground for
its eventual arrival. As Max Nettlau summarised, *"[n]othing but a
superficial interpretation of some of Kropotkin's observations could
lead one to conclude that anarchist communism could spring into life
through an act of sweeping improvisation, with the waving of a magic
wand."* [**A Short History of Anarchism**, p. 80]

This was what happened in the Spanish Revolution, for example. Different
collectives operated in different ways. Some tried to introduce free
communism, some a combination of rationing and communism, others
introduced equal pay, others equalised pay as much as possible and so
on. Over time, as economic conditions changed and difficulties developed
the collectives changed their mode of distribution to take them into
account. These collectives indicate well the practical aspects of
anarchist and its desire to accommodate and not ignore reality.

Lastly, and as an aside, it this anarchist awareness of the disruptive
effects of a revolution on a country's economy which, in part, makes
anarchists extremely sceptical of pro-Bolshevik rationales that blame
the difficult economic conditions facing the Russian Revolution for
Bolshevik authoritarianism (see [section H.6.1](secH6.html#sech61) for a
fuller discussion of this). If, as Kropotkin argued, a social revolution
inevitably results in massive economic disruption then, clearly,
Bolshevism should be avoided if it cannot handle such inevitable events.
In such circumstances, centralisation would only aid the disruption, not
reduce it. This awareness of the problems facing a social revolution
also led anarchists to stress the importance of local action and mass
participation. As Kropotkin put it, the *"immense constructive work
demanded by a social revolution cannot be accomplished by a central
government . . . It has need of knowledge, of brains and of the
voluntary collaboration of a host of local and specialised forces which
alone can attack the diversity of economic problems in their local
aspects."* [**Anarchism**, pp. 255-6] Without this local action,
co-ordinated joint activity would remain a dead letter.

In summary, anarchists acknowledge that **politically** there is no
transitional period (i.e. the state must be abolished and replaced by a
free federation of self-managed working class organisations).
Economically anarchists recognise that different areas will develop in
different ways and so there will be various economical transitional
forms. Rather than seeing *"full blown communism"* being the instant
result of a socialist revolution, anarchist-communists actually argue
the opposite - *"full blown communism"* will develop only after a
successful revolution and the inevitable period of social reconstruction
which comes after it. A *"full blown"* communist economy will develop as
society becomes ready for it. What we **do** argue is that any
transitional economic form must be based on the principles of the type
of society it desires. In other words, any transitional period must be
as communistic as possible if communism is your final aim and, equally,
it must be libertarian if your final goal is freedom.

Also see [section I.2.2](secI2.html#seci22) for further discussion on
this issue.

H.2.6 How do Marxists misrepresent Anarchist ideas on mutual aid?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Anarchist ideas on mutual aid are often misrepresented by Marxists.
Looking at Pat Stack's *"Anarchy in the UK?"* article, for example, we
find a particularly terrible misrepresentation of Kropotkin's ideas.
Indeed, it is so incorrect that it is either a product of ignorance or a
desire to deceive (and as we shall indicate, it is probably the latter).
Here is Stack's account of Kropotkin's ideas:

> *"And the anarchist Peter Kropotkin, far from seeing class conflict as
> the dynamic for social change as Marx did, saw co-operation being at
> the root of the social process. He believed the co-operation of what
> he termed 'mutual aid' was the natural order, which was disrupted by
> centralised states. Indeed in everything from public walkways and
> libraries through to the Red Cross, Kropotkin felt he was witnessing
> confirmation that society was moving towards his mutual aid, prevented
> only from completing the journey by the state. It follows that if
> class conflict is not the motor of change, the working class is not
> the agent and collective struggle not the means."* [*"Anarchy in the
> UK?"*, **Socialist Review**, no. 246]

There are three issues with Stack's summary. Firstly, Kropotkin did not,
in fact, reject class conflict as the *"dynamic of social change"* nor
reject the working class as its *"agent."* Secondly, all of Stack's
examples of *"Mutual Aid"* do not, in fact, appear in Kropotkin's
classic book **Mutual Aid**. They do appear in other works by Kropotkin
but **not** as examples of *"mutual aid."* Thirdly, in **Mutual Aid**
Kropotkin discusses such aspects of working class *"collective
struggle"* as strikes and unions. All in all, it is Stack's total and
utter lack of understanding of Kropotkin's ideas which immediately
stands out from his comments.

As we have discussed how collective, working class direct action,
organisation and solidarity in the class struggle were at the core of
Kropotkin's politics in [section H.2.2](secH2.html#sech22), we will not
do so here. Rather, we will discuss how Stack lies about Kropotkin's
ideas on mutual aid. As just noted, the examples Stack lists are not to
be found in Kropotkin's classic work **Mutual Aid**. Now, **if**
Kropotkin **had** considered them as examples of *"mutual aid"* then he
would have listed them in that work. This does not mean, however, that
Kropotkin did not mention these examples. He does, but in other works
(notably his essay **Anarchist-Communism: Its Basis and Principles**)
and he does **not** use them as examples of mutual aid. Here are
Kropotkin's own words on these examples:

> "We maintain, moreover, not only that communism is a desirable state
> of society, but that the growing tendency of modern society is
> precisely towards communism - free communism - notwithstanding the
> seemingly contradictory growth of individualism. In the growth of
> individualism . . . we see merely the endeavours of the individual
> towards emancipating himself from the steadily growing powers of
> capital and the State. But side by side with this growth we see also .
> . . the latent struggle of the producers of wealth to maintain the
> partial communism of old, as well as to reintroduce communist
> principles in a new shape, as soon as favourable conditions permit it.
> . . the communist tendency is continually reasserting itself and
> trying to make its way into public life. The penny bridge disappears
> before the public bridge; and the turnpike road before the free road.
> The same spirit pervades thousands of other institutions. Museums,
> free libraries, and free public schools; parks and pleasure grounds;
> paved and lighted streets, free for everybody's use; water supplied to
> private dwellings, with a growing tendency towards disregarding the
> exact amount of it used by the individual; tramways and railways which
> have already begun to introduce the season ticket or the uniform tax,
> and will surely go much further in this line when they are no longer
> private property: all these are tokens showing in what direction
> further progress is to be expected.
> "It is in the direction of putting the wants of the individual
> **above** the valuation of the service he has rendered, or might
> render, to society; in considering society as a whole, so intimately
> connected together that a service rendered to any individual is a
> service rendered to the whole society." [**Anarchism**, pp. 59-60]

As is clear, the examples Stack selects have nothing to do with mutual
aid in Kropotkin's eyes. Rather, they are examples of communistic
tendencies within capitalism, empirical evidence that can be used to not
only show that communism can work but also that it is not a utopian
social solution but an expression of tendencies within society. Simply
put, he is using examples from existing society to show that communism
is not impossible.

Similarly with Stack's other examples, which are **not** used as
expressions of *"mutual aid"* but rather as evidence that social life
can be organised without government. [**Op. Cit.**, pp. 65-7] Just as
with communism, he gave concrete examples of libertarian tendencies
within society to prove the possibility of an anarchist society. And
just like his examples of communistic activities within capitalism, his
examples of co-operation without the state are not listed as examples of
*"mutual aid."*

All this would suggest that Stack has either not read Kropotkin's works
or that he has and consciously decided to misrepresent his ideas. In
fact, its a combination of the two. Stack (as proven by his talk at
**Marxism 2001**) gathered his examples of *"mutual aid"* from Paul
Avrich's essay *"Kropotkin's Ethical Anarchism"* contained in his
**Anarchist Portraits**. As such, he has not read the source material.
Moreover, he simply distorted what Avrich wrote. In other words, not
only has he not read Kropotkin's works, he consciously decided to
misrepresent the secondary source he used. This indicates the quality of
almost all Marxist critiques of anarchism.

For example, Avrich correctly noted that Kropotkin did not *"deny that
the 'struggle for existence' played an important role in the evolution
of species. In **Mutual Aid** he declares unequivocally that 'life
**is** struggle; and in that struggle the fittest survive.'"* Kropotkin
simply argued that co-operation played a key role in determining who
was, in fact, the fittest. Similarly, Avrich listed many of the same
examples Stack presents but not in his discussion of Kropotkin's ideas
on mutual aid. Rather, he correctly did so in his discussion of how
Kropotkin saw examples of anarchist communism *"manifesting itself 'in
the thousands of developments of modern life.'"* This did not mean that
Kropotkin did not see the need for a social revolution, quite the
reverse. As Avrich noted, Kropotkin *"did not shrink from the necessity
of revolution"* as he *"did not expect the propertied classes to give up
their privileges and possession without a fight."* This *"was to be a
**social** revolution, carried out by the masses themselves"* achieved
by means of *"expropriation"* of social wealth. [**Anarchist
Portraits**, p. 58, p. 62 and p. 66]

So much for Stack's claims. As can be seen, they are not only a total
misrepresentation of Kropotkin's work, they are also a distortion of his
source!

A few more points need to be raised on this subject.

Firstly, Kropotkin never claimed that mutual aid *"was the natural
order."* Rather, he stressed that Mutual Aid was (to use the subtitle of
his book on the subject) *"a factor of evolution."* As he put it, mutual
aid *"represents one of the factors of evolution"*, another being *"the
self-assertion of the individual, not only to attain personal or caste
superiority, economical, political, and spiritual, but also in its much
more important although less evident function of breaking through the
bonds, always prone to become crystallised, which the tribe, the village
community, the city, and the State impose upon the individual."* Thus
Kropotkin recognised that there is class struggle within society as well
as *"the self-assertion of the individual taken as a progressive
element"* (i.e., struggle against forms of social association which now
hinder individual freedom and development). Kropotkin did not deny the
role of struggle, in fact the opposite as he stressed that the book's
examples concentrated on mutual aid simply because mutual struggle
(between individuals of the same species) had *"already been analysed,
described, and glorified from time immemorial"* and, as such, he felt no
need to illustrate it. He did note that it *"was necessary to show,
first of all, the immense part which this factor plays in the evolution
of both the animal world and human societies. Only after this has been
fully recognised will it be possible to proceed to a comparison between
the two factors."* [**Mutual Aid**, p. 231 and pp. 231-2] So at no stage
did Kropotkin deny either factor (unlike the bourgeois apologists he was
refuting).

Secondly, Stack's argument that Kropotkin argued that co-operation was
the natural order is in contradiction with his other claims that
anarchism *"despises the collectivity"* and *"dismiss[es] the importance
of the collective nature of change"* (see [section
H.2.2](secH2.html#sech22)). How can you have co-operation without
forming a collective? And, equally, surely support for co-operation
clearly implies the recognition of the *"collective nature of change"*?
Moreover, had Stack bothered to ***read*** Kropotkin's classic he would
have been aware that both unions and strikes are listed as expressions
of *"mutual aid"* (a fact, of course, which would undermine Stack's
silly assertion that anarchists reject collective working class struggle
and organisation). Thus we find Kropotkin stating that *"Unionism"*
expressed the *"worker's need of mutual support"* as well as discussing
how the state *"legislated against the workers' unions"* and that these
were *"the conditions under which the mutual-aid tendency had to make
its way."* *"To practise mutual support under such circumstances was
anything but an easy task."* This repression failed, as *"the workers'
unions were continually reconstituted"* and spread, forming *"vigourous
federal organisations . . . to support the branches during strikes and
prosecutions."* In spite of the difficulties in organising unions and
fighting strikes, he noted that *"every year there are thousands of
strikes . . . the most severe and protracted contests being, as a rule,
the so-called 'sympathy strikes,' which are entered upon to support
locked-out comrades or to maintain the rights of the unions."* Anyone
(like Kropotkin) who had *"lived among strikers speak with admiration of
the mutual aid and support which are constantly practised by them."*
[**Op. Cit.**, pp. 210-3]

Kropotkin, as noted, recognised the importance of struggle or
competition as a means of survival but also argued that co-operation
within a species was the best means for it to survive in a hostile
environment. This applied to life under capitalism. In the hostile
environment of class society, then the only way in which working class
people could survive would be to practice mutual aid (in other words,
solidarity). Little wonder, then, that Kropotkin listed strikes and
unions as expressions of mutual aid in capitalist society. Moreover, if
we take Stack's arguments at face value, then he clearly is arguing that
solidarity is not an important factor in the class struggle and that
mutual aid and co-operation cannot change the world! Hardly what you
would expect a socialist to argue. In other words, his inaccurate
diatribe against Kropotkin backfires on his own ideas.

Thirdly, **Mutual Aid** is primarily a work of popular science and not a
work on revolutionary anarchist theory like, say, **The Conquest of
Bread** or **Words of a Rebel**. As such, it does not present a full
example of Kropotkin's revolutionary ideas and how mutual aid fits into
them. However, it does present some insights on the question of social
progress which indicate that he did not think that *"co-operation"* was
*"at the root of the social process,"* as Stack claims. For example,
Kropotkin noted that *"[w]hen Mutual Aid institutions . . . began . . .
to lose their primitive character, to be invaded by parasitic growths,
and thus to become hindrances to process, the revolt of individuals
against these institutions took always two different aspects. Part of
those who rose up strove to purify the old institutions, or to work out
a higher form of commonwealth."* But at the same time, others
*"endeavoured to break down the protective institutions of mutual
support, with no other intention but to increase their own wealth and
their own powers."* In this conflict *"lies the real tragedy of
history."* He also noted that the mutual aid tendency *"continued to
live in the villages and among the poorer classes in the towns."*
Indeed, *"in so far as"* as new *"economical and social institutions"*
were *"a creation of the masses"* they *"have all originated from the
same source"* of mutual aid. [**Op. Cit.**, pp. 18-9 and p. 180]
Clearly, Kropotkin saw history marked by both co-operation and conflict
as you would expect in a society divided by class and hierarchy.

Significantly, Kropotkin considered **Mutual Aid** as an attempt to
write history from below, from the perspective of the oppressed. As he
put it, history, *"such as it has hitherto been written, is almost
entirely a description of the ways and means by which theocracy,
military power, autocracy, and, later on, the richer classes' rule have
been promoted, established, and maintained."* The *"mutual aid factor
has been hitherto totally lost sight of; it was simply denied, or even
scoffed at."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 231] He was well aware that mutual aid
(or solidarity) could not be applied between classes in a class society.
Indeed, as noted, his chapters on mutual aid under capitalism contain
the strike and union. As he put it in an earlier work:

> *"What solidarity can exist between the capitalist and the worker he
> exploits? Between the head of an army and the soldier? Between the
> governing and the governed?"* [**Words of a Rebel**, p. 30]

In summary, Stack's assertions about Kropotkin's theory of *"Mutual
Aid"* are simply false. He simply distorts the source material and shows
a total ignorance of Kropotkin's work (which he obviously has not
bothered to read before criticising it). A truthful account of *"Mutual
Aid"* would involve recognising that Kropotkin showed it being expressed
in both strikes and labour unions and that he saw solidarity between
working people as the means of not only surviving within the hostile
environment of capitalism but also as the basis of a mass revolution
which would end it.

H.2.7 Who do anarchists see as their *"agents of social change"*?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

It is often charged, usually without any evidence, that anarchists do
not see the working class as the *"agent"* of the social revolution. Pat
Stack, for example, states *"the failure of anarchism [is] to understand
the centrality of the working class itself."* He argues that for Marx,
*"the working class would change the world and in the process change
itself. It would become the agent for social advance and human
liberty."* For Bakunin, however, *"skilled artisans and organised
factory workers, far from being the source of the destruction of
capitalism, were 'tainted by pretensions and aspirations'. Instead
Bakunin looked to those cast aside by capitalism, those most damaged,
brutalised and marginalised. The lumpen proletariat, the outlaws, the
'uncivilised, disinherited, illiterate', as he put it, would be his
agents for change."* [*"Anarchy in the UK?"*, **Socialist Review**, no.
246] He fails to provide any references for his accusations. This is
unsurprising, as to do so would mean that the reader could check for
themselves the validity of Stack's claims.

Take, for example, the quote *"uncivilised, disinherited, illiterate"*
Stack uses as evidence. This expression is from an essay written by
Bakunin in 1872 and which expressed what he considered the differences
between his ideas and those of Marx. The quote can be found on page 294
of **Bakunin on Anarchism**. On the previous page, we discover Bakunin
arguing that *"for the International to be a real power, it must be able
to organise within its ranks the immense majority of the proletariat of
Europe, of America, of all lands."* [p. 293] Clearly Stack is quoting
out of context, distorting Bakunin's position to present a radically
false image of anarchism. Moreover, as we will indicate, Stack's also
quotes them outside the historical context as well.

Let us begin with Bakunin's views on *"skilled artisans and organised
factory workers."* In **Statism and Anarchy**, for example, we discover
Bakunin arguing that the *"proletariat . . . must enter the
International [Workers' Association] en masse, form factory, artisan,
and agrarian sections, and unite them into local federations"* for *"the
sake of its own liberation."* [p. 51] This perspective is the
predominant one in Bakunin's ideas with the Russian continually arguing
that anarchists saw *"the new social order"* being *"attained . . .
through the social (and therefore anti-political) organisation and power
of the working masses of the cities and villages."* He argued that
*"only the trade union sections can give their members . . . practical
education and consequently only they can draw into the organisation of
the International the masses of the proletariat, those masses without
whose practical co-operation . . . the Social Revolution will never be
able to triumph."* The International, in Bakunin's words, *"organises
the working masses . . . from the bottom up"* and that this was *"the
proper aim of the organisation of trade union sections."* He stressed
that revolutionaries must *"[o]rganise the city proletariat in the name
of revolutionary Socialism . . . [and] unite it into one preparatory
organisation together with the peasantry."* [**The Political Philosophy
of Bakunin**, p. 300, p. 310, p. 319 and p. 378]

This support for organised workers and artisans can also be seen from
the rest of the essay Stack distorts, in which Bakunin discusses the
*"flower of the proletariat"* as well as the policy that the
**International Workingmen's Association** should follow (i.e. the
organised revolutionary workers). He argued that its *"sections and
federations [must be] free to develop its own policies . . . [to] attain
real unity, basically economic, which will necessarily lead to real
political unity . . . The foundation for the unity of the International
. . . has already been laid by the common sufferings, interests, needs,
and real aspirations of the workers of the whole world."* He stressed
that *"the International has been . . . the work of the proletariat
itself . . . It was their keen and profound instinct as workers . . .
which impelled them to find the principle and true purpose of the
International. They took the common needs already in existence as the
foundation and saw the **international organisation of economic conflict
against capitalism** as the true objective of this association. In
giving it exclusively this base and aim, the workers at once established
the entire power of the International. They opened wide the gates to all
the millions of the oppressed and exploited."* The International, as
well as *"organising local, national and international strikes"* and
*"establishing national and international trade unions,"* would discuss
*"political and philosophical questions."* The workers *"join the
International for one very practical purpose: solidarity in the struggle
for full economic rights against the oppressive exploitation by the
bourgeoisie."* [**Bakunin on Anarchism**, pp. 297-8, pp. 298-9 and pp.
301-2]

All this, needless to say, makes a total mockery of Stack's claim that
Bakunin did not see *"skilled artisans and organised factory workers"*
as *"the source of the destruction of capitalism"* and *"agents for
change."* Indeed, it is hard to find a greater distortion of Bakunin's
ideas. Rather than dismiss *"skilled artisans"* and *"organised factory
workers"* Bakunin desired to organise them along with agricultural
workers into unions and get these unions to affiliate to the
**International Workers' Association**. He argued again and again that
the working class, organised in union, were the means of making a
revolution (i.e. *"the source of the destruction of capitalism,"* to use
Stack's words).

Only in **this** context can we understand Bakunin's comments which
Stack (selectively) quotes. Any apparent contradiction generated by
Stack's quoting out of context is quickly solved by looking at Bakunin's
work. This reference to the *"uncivilised, disinherited, illiterate"*
comes from a polemic against Marx. From the context, it can quickly be
seen that by these terms Bakunin meant the bulk of the working class. In
his words:

> "To me the flower of the proletariat is not, as it is to the Marxists,
> the upper layer, the aristocracy of labour, those who are the most
> cultured, who earn more and live more comfortably that all the other
> workers. Precisely this semi-bourgeois layer of workers would, if the
> Marxists had their way, constitute their **fourth governing class.**
> This could indeed happen if the great mass of the proletariat does not
> guard against it. By virtue of its relative well-being and
> semi-bourgeois position, this upper layer of workers is unfortunately
> only too deeply saturated with all the political and social prejudices
> and all the narrow aspirations and pretensions of the bourgeoisie. Of
> all the proletariat, this upper layer is the least socialist, the most
> individualist.
> "By the **flower of the proletariat**, I mean above all that great
> mass, those millions of the uncultivated, the disinherited, the
> miserable, the illiterates . . . I mean precisely that eternal 'meat'
> (on which governments thrive), that great **rabble of the people**
> (underdogs, 'dregs of society') ordinarily designated by Marx and
> Engels by the phrase . . . Lumpenproletariat" [**Bakunin on
> Anarchism**, p. 294]

Thus Bakunin contrasted a *"semi-bourgeois"* layer to the *"great mass
of the proletariat."* In a later work, Bakunin makes the same point,
namely that there was *"a special category of relatively affluent
workers, earning higher wages, boasting of their literary capacities and
. . . impregnated by a variety of bourgeois prejudices . . . in Italy .
. . they are insignificant in number and influence . . . In Italy it is
the extremely poor proletariat that predominates. Marx speaks
disdainfully, but quite unjustly, of this **Lumpenproletariat.** For in
them, and only in them, and not in the bourgeois strata of workers, are
there crystallised the entire intelligence and power of the coming
Social Revolution."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 334] Again it is clear that
Bakunin is referring to a small minority within the working class and
**not** dismissing the working class as a whole. He explicitly pointed
to the *"**bourgeois-influenced** minority of the urban proletariat"*
and contrasted this minority to *"the mass of the proletariat, both
rural and urban."* [**Michael Bakunin: Selected Writings**, p. 254]

Clearly, Stack is distorting Bakunin's ideas on this subject when he
claims that Bakunin thought **all** workers were *"tainted by
pretensions and aspirations."* In fact, like Marx, Engels and Lenin,
Bakunin differentiated between different types of workers. This did not
mean he rejected organised workers or skilled artisans nor the
organisation of working people into revolutionary unions, quite the
reverse. As can be seen, Bakunin argued there was a group of workers who
accepted bourgeois society and did relatively well under it. It was
**these** workers who were *"frequently no less egoistic than bourgeois
exploiters, no less pernicious to the International than bourgeois
socialists, and no less vain and ridiculous than bourgeois nobles."*
[**The Basic Bakunin**, p. 108] It is comments like this that Marxists
quote out of context and use for their claims that Bakunin did not see
the working class as the agent of social change. However, rather than
refer to the whole working class, Stack quotes Bakunin's thoughts in
relation to a minority strata within it. Clearly, from the context,
Bakunin **did not** mean **all** working class people.

Also, let us not forget the historical context. After all, when Bakunin
was writing the vast majority of the working population across the world
was, in fact, illiterate and disinherited. To get some sort of idea of
the numbers of working people who would have been classed as *"the
uncultivated, the disinherited, the miserable, the illiterates"* we have
to provide some numbers. In Spain, for example, *"in 1870, something
like 60 per cent of the population was illiterate."* [Gerald Brenan,
**The Spanish Labyrinth**, p. 50] In Russia, in 1897 (i.e. 21 years
after Bakunin's death), *"only 21% of the total population of European
Russia was literate. This was mainly because of the appallingly low rate
of literacy in the countryside - 17% compared to 45% in the towns."*
[S.A. Smith, **Red Petrograd**, p. 34] Stack, in effect, is excluding
the majority of the working masses from the working class movement
**and** the revolution in the 1860-70s by his comments. Little wonder
Bakunin said what he said. By ignoring the historical context (as he
ignores the context of Bakunin's comments), Stack misleads the reader
and presents a distinctly distorted picture of Bakunin's thought.

In other words, Bakunin's comments on the *"flower of the proletariat"*
apply to the majority of the working class during his lifetime and for a
number of decades afterwards and **not** to an underclass, not to what
Marx termed the "lumpenproletariat". As proven above, Bakunin's
*"lumpenproletariat"* is not what Marxists mean by the term. If Bakunin
had meant the same as Marx by the "lumpenproletariat" then this would
not make sense as the "lumpenproletariat" for Marx were not wage
workers. This can best be seen when Bakunin argues that the
International must organise this *"flower of the proletariat"* and
conduct economic collective struggle against the capitalist class. In
his other works (and in the specific essay these quotes are derived
from) Bakunin stressed the need to organise all workers and peasants
into unions to fight the state and bosses and his arguments that workers
associations should not only be the means to fight capitalism but also
the framework of an anarchist society. Clearly, Sam Dolgoff's summary of
Bakunin's ideas on this subject is the correct one:

> *"Bakunin's **Lumpenproletariat** . . . was broader than Marx's, since
> it included all the submerged classes: unskilled, unemployed, and poor
> workers, poor peasant proprietors, landless agricultural labourers,
> oppressed racial minorities, alienated and idealistic youth, declasse
> intellectuals, and 'bandits' (by whom Bakunin meant insurrectionary
> 'Robin Hoods' like Pugachev, Stenka Razin, and the Italian
> Carbonari)."* [*"Introduction"*, **Bakunin on Anarchism**, pp. 13-4]

Moreover, the issue is clouded by translation issues as well. As Mark
Leier notes Bakunin *"rarely used the word 'lumpenproletariat.' While he
does use the French word **canaille**, this is better translated as
'mob' or 'rabble' . . . When Bakunin does talk about the **canaille** or
rabble, he usually refers not to the lumpenproletariat as such but to
the poorer sections of the working class . . . While we might translate
'destitute proletariat' as 'lumpenproletariat,' Bakunin himself . . . is
referring to a portion of the proletariat and the peasantry, not the
lumpenproletariat."* [**Bakunin: The Creative Passion**, p. 221]

Nor is Stack the only Marxist to make such arguments as regards Bakunin.
Paul Thomas quotes Bakunin arguing that the working class *"remains
socialist without knowing it"* because of *"the very force of its
position"* and *"all the conditions of its material existence"* and
then, incredulously, adds that *"[i]t is for this reason that Bakunin
turned away from the proletariat and its scientific socialism"* towards
the peasantry. [**Karl Marx and the Anarchists**, p. 291] A more
distorted account of Bakunin's ideas would be hard to find (and there is
a lot of competition for that particular honour). The quotes Thomas
provides are from Bakunin's *"The Policy of the International"* in which
he discussed his ideas on how the International Working-Men's
Association should operate (namely *"the collective struggle of the
workers against the bosses"*). At the time (and for some time after)
Bakunin called himself a revolutionary socialist and argued that by
class struggle, the worker would soon *"recognise himself [or herself]
to be a revolutionary socialist, and he [or she] will act like one."*
[**The Basic Bakunin**, p. 103] As such, the argument that the social
position workers are placed makes them *"socialist without knowing"*
does not, in fact, imply that Bakunin thought they would become Marxists
(*"scientific socialism"*) and, therefore, he turned against them.
Rather, it meant that, for Bakunin, anarchist ideas were a product of
working class life and it was a case of turning instinctive feelings
into conscious thought by collective struggle. As noted above, Bakunin
did not *"turn away"* from these ideas nor the proletariat. Indeed,
Bakunin held to the importance of organising the proletariat (along with
artisans and peasants) to the end of his life. Quite simply, Thomas is
distorting Bakunin's ideas.

Lastly, we have to point out a certain irony (and hypocrisy) in Marxist
attacks on Bakunin on this subject. This is because Marx, Engels and
Lenin held similar views on the corrupted *"upper strata"* of the
working class as Bakunin did. Indeed, Marxists have a specific term to
describe this semi-bourgeois strata of workers, namely the *"labour
aristocracy."* Marx, for example, talked about the trade unions in
Britain being *"an aristocratic minority"* and the *"great mass of
workers . . . has long been outside"* them (indeed, *"the most wretched
mass has never belonged."*) [**Collected Works**, vol. 22, p. 614]
Engels also talked about *"a small, privileged, 'protected' minority"*
within the working class, which he also called *"the working-class
aristocracy."* [**Op. Cit.**, vol. 27, p. 320 and p. 321] Lenin
approvingly quotes Engels arguing that the *"English proletariat is
actually becoming more and more bourgeois, so that this most bourgeois
of all nations is apparently aiming at the possession of . . . a
bourgeois proletariat **alongside** the bourgeoisie."* [quoted by Lenin,
**Collected Works**, vol. 22, p. 283] Like Lenin, Engels explained this
by the dominant position of Britain within the world market. Indeed,
Lenin argued that *"a section of the British proletariat becomes
bourgeois."* For Lenin, imperialist *"superprofits"* make it
*"**possible to bribe** the labour leaders and the upper stratum of the
labour aristocracy."* This *"stratum of workers-turned-bourgeois, or the
labour aristocracy, who are quite philistine in their mode of life, in
the size of their earnings and in their entire outlook . . . are the
real **agents of the bourgeoisie in the working-class** movement, the
labour lieutenants of the capitalist class."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 284 and
p. 194]

As can be seen, this is similar to Bakunin's ideas and, ironically
enough, nearly identical to Stack's distortion of those ideas
(particularly in the case of Marx). However, only someone with a desire
to lie would suggest that any of them dismissed the working class as
their *"agent of change"* based on this (selective) quoting.
Unfortunately, that is what Stack does with Bakunin. Ultimately, Stack's
comments seem hypocritical in the extreme attacking Bakunin while
remaining quiet on the near identical comments of his heroes.

It should be noted that this analysis is confirmed by non-anarchists who
have actually studied Bakunin. Wayne Thorpe, an academic who specialises
in syndicalism, presents an identical summary of Bakunin's ideas on this
matter. [**"The Workers Themselves"**, p. 280] Marxist selective quoting
not withstanding, for Bakunin (as another academic noted) *"it seemed
self-evident that the revolution, even in Eastern Europe, required the
unity of peasantry and city workers because of the latter's more
advanced consciousness."* The notion that Bakunin stressed the role of
the lumpenproletariat is a *"popular stereotype"* but is one *"more
distorted by its decisive omissions than in what it says."* *"Marx"*, he
correctly summarised, *"accented the revolutionary role of the urban
proletariat and tended to deprecate the peasantry, while Bakunin,
although **accepting** the vanguard role of the proletariat in the
revolution, felt that the peasantry, too, approached correctly, also had
great potential for revolution."* [Alvin W. Gouldner, *"Marx's Last
Battle: Bakunin and the First International"*, pp. 853-884, **Theory and
Society**, Vol. 11, No. 6, p. 871, p. 869 and p. 869] This flowed from
Bakunin's materialist politics:

> *"Not restricting the revolution to those societies in which an
> advanced industrialism had produced a massive urban proletariat,
> Bakunin observed sensibly that the class composition of the revolution
> was bound to differ in industrially advanced Western Europe and in
> Eastern European where the economy was still largely agricultural . .
> . This is a far cry, then, from the Marxist stereotype of
> Bakunin-the-anarchist who relied exclusively on the backward peasantry
> and ignored the proletariat."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 870]

All in all, once a historic and textual context is placed on Bakunin's
words, it is clear which social class was considered as the social
revolution's *"agents of change"*: the working class (i.e. wage workers,
artisans, peasants and so on). In this, other revolutionary anarchists
follow him. Looking at Kropotkin we find a similar perspective to
Bakunin's. In his first political work, Kropotkin explicitly raised the
question of *"where our activity be directed"* and answered it
*"categorically"* - *"unquestionably among the peasantry and urban
workers."* In fact, he *"consider[ed] this answer the fundamental
position in our practical program."* This was because *"the insurrection
must proceed among the peasantry and urban workers themselves"* if it
were to succeed. As such, revolutionaries *"must not stand outside the
people but among them, must serve not as a champion of some alien
opinions worked out in isolation, but only as a more distinct, more
complete expression of the demands of the people themselves."*
[**Selected Writings on Anarchism and Revolution**, pp. 85-6]

That was in 1873. Nearly 30 years later, Kropotkin expressed identical
opinions stating that he *"did not need to overrate the qualities of the
workers in order to espouse the cause of the social, predominantly
workers' revolution."* The need was to *"forge solidarity"* between
workers and it was *"precisely to awaken this solidarity - without which
progress would be difficult - that we must work to insure that the
syndicates and the trade unions not be pushed aside by the bourgeois."*
The social position of the working class people ensured their key role
in the revolution: *"Being exploited today at the bottom of the social
ladder, it is to his advantage to demand equality. He has never ceased
demanding it, he has fought for it and will fight for it again, whereas
the bourgeois . . . thinks it is to his advantage to maintain
inequality."* Unsurprisingly, Kropotkin stressed that *"I have always
preached active participation in the workers' movement, in the
**revolutionary workers' movement**"* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 299, pp.
299-300, p. 300 and p. 304]

Much the same can be said for the likes of Goldman, Berkman, Malatesta
and so on - as even a basic familiarity with their writings and activism
would confirm. Of all the major anarchist thinkers, it could be objected
that Murray Bookchin fits Stack's distortions. After all, he did attack
*"The Myth of the Proletariat"* as the agent of revolutionary change,
arguing that *"the traditional class struggle ceases to have
revolutionary implications; it reveals itself as the physiology of the
prevailing society, not as the labour pains of birth."* Yet, even here,
Bookchin explicitly argued that he made *"no claims that a social
revolution is possible without the participation of the industrial
proletariat"* and noted that he *"tries to show how the proletariat can
be won to the revolutionary movement by stressing issues that concern
quality of life and work."* Thus *"class struggle does not centre around
material exploitation alone"* but has a wider understanding which cannot
be reduced to *"a single class defined by its relationship to the means
of production."* Like other anarchists, he saw social change coming from
the oppressed, as *"the alienated and oppressed sectors of society are
now the **majority** of the people."* In other words, for Bookchin (if
not other anarchists) expressions like *"class struggle"* simply *"fail
to encompass the cultural and spiritual revolt that is taking place
along with the economic struggle."* [**Post-Scarcity Anarchism**, p.
117, p. 150, p. 151 and p. 152]

So Bookchin's apparent rejection of class struggle and the "proletariat"
is not, on closer reading, any such thing. He urged a wider form of
struggle, one which includes issues such as hierarchy, oppression,
ecological matters and so on rather than the exclusive concern with
economic exploitation and class which many radicals (usually Marxists)
focus on. Somewhat ironically, it should be noted that this "rejection"
in part flowed from Bookchin's own past in the Stalinist and Trotskyist
movements, both of which tended to idealise the industrial worker and
limit "proletarian" to that specific sub-section of the working class.
Bookchin himself expressed this blinkered perspective when he
*"dispose[d] of the notion that anyone is a 'proletarian' who has
nothing to sell but his labour power"* as Marx and Engels considered
that class as *"reaching its most advanced form in the **industrial**
proletariat, which corresponded to the most advanced form of capital."*
[**Op. Cit.**, p. 115fn] Sadly, Bookchin reinforced this debased notion
of working class and our struggle in the very process of trying to
overcome it. Yet he always argued for a wider concept of social struggle
which included, but was not limited to, economic class and exploitation
and, as a result, included all sections of the working class and not
just workers in large-scale industry. In this he followed a long
anarchist tradition.

To conclude, for anarchists, the social revolution will be made by the
working class (*"Anarchists, like Socialists, usually believe in the
doctrine of class war."* [Bertrand Russell, **Roads to Freedom**, p.
38]). However, as British anarchist Benjamin Franks summarises,
*"[b]ecause anarchists hold to a broader view of the working class,
which includes the lumpenproletariat, they have been accused of
promoting this section above others. This standard marxist
interpretation of anarchism is inaccurate; anarchists simply include the
lumpenproletariat as part of the working class, rather than exclude or
exalt it."* [**Rebel Alliances**, p. 168] Ultimately, for anyone to
claim that Bakunin, for any social anarchist, rejects the working class
as an agent of social change simply shows their ignorance of the
politics they are trying to attack.

H.2.8 What is the relationship of anarchism to syndicalism?
-----------------------------------------------------------

One of the most common Marxist techniques when they discuss anarchism is
to contrast the likes of Bakunin and Kropotkin to the revolutionary
syndicalists. The argument runs along the lines that "classical"
anarchism is individualistic and rejects working class organisation and
power while syndicalism is a step forward from it (i.e. a step closer to
Marxism). Sadly, such arguments simply show the ignorance of the author
rather than any form of factual basis. When the ideas of revolutionary
anarchists like Bakunin and Kropotkin are compared to revolutionary
syndicalism, the similarities are soon discovered.

This kind of argument can be found in Pat Stack's essay *"Anarchy in the
UK?"* After totally distorting the ideas of anarchists like Bakunin and
Kropotkin, Stack argues that anarcho-syndicalists *"tended to look to
the spontaneity and anti-statism of anarchism, the economic and
materialist analysis of Marxism, and the organisational tools of trade
unionism. Practically every serious anarchist organisation came from or
leant on this tradition . . . The huge advantage they had over other
anarchists was their understanding of the power of the working class,
the centrality of the point of production (the workplace) and the need
for collective action."* [**Socialist Review**, no. 246]

Given that Stack's claims that anarchists reject the *"need for
collective action,"* do not understand *"the power of the working
class"* and the *"centrality"* of the workplace are simply inventions,
it would suggest that Stack's *"huge advantage"* does not, in fact,
exist and is pure nonsense. Bakunin, Kropotkin and all revolutionary
anarchists, as proven in [section H.2.2](secH2.html#sech22), already
understood all this and based their politics on the need for collective
working class struggle at the point of production. As such, by
contrasting anarcho-syndicalism with anarchism (as expressed by the
likes of Bakunin and Kropotkin) Stack simply shows his utter and total
ignorance of his subject matter.

Moreover, if he bothered to read the works of the likes of Bakunin and
Kropotkin he would discover that many of their ideas were identical to
those of revolutionary syndicalism. For example, Bakunin argued that the
*"organisation of the trade sections, their federation in the
International, and their representation by Chambers of Labour, . . .
[allow] the workers . . . [to] combin[e] theory and practice . . . [and]
bear in themselves the living germs of **the social order**, which is to
replace the bourgeois world. They are creating not only the ideas but
also the facts of the future itself."* [quoted by Rudolf Rocker,
**Anarcho-Syndicalism**, p. 50] Like the syndicalists, he argued *"the
natural organisation of the masses . . . is organisation based on the
various ways that their various types of work define their day-to-day
life; it is organisation by trade association"* and once *"every
occupation . . . is represented within the International [Working-Men's
Association], its organisation, the organisation of the masses of the
people will be complete."* Moreover, Bakunin stressed that the working
class had *"but a single path, that of **emancipation through practical
action*** which meant *"workers' solidarity in their struggle against
the bosses"* by *"**trades-unions, organisation, and the federation of
resistance funds**"* [**The Basic Bakunin**, p. 139 and p. 103]

Like the syndicalists, Bakunin stressed working class self-activity and
control over the class struggle:

> "Toilers count no longer on anyone but yourselves. Do not demoralise
> and paralyse your growing strength by being duped into alliances with
> bourgeois Radicalism . . . Abstain from all participation in bourgeois
> Radicalism and organise outside of it the forces of the proletariat.
> The bases of this organisation are already completely given: they are
> the workshops and the federation of workshops, the creation of
> fighting funds, instruments of struggle against the bourgeoisie, and
> their federation, not only national, but international.
> "And when the hour of revolution sounds, you will proclaim the
> liquidation of the State and of bourgeois society, anarchy, that is to
> say the true, frank people's revolution . . . and the new organisation
> from below upwards and from the circumference to the centre." [quoted
> by K.J. Kenafick, **Michael Bakunin and Karl Marx**, pp. 120-1]

Like the later syndicalists, Bakunin was in favour of a general strike
as a means of bringing about a social revolution. As *"strikes spread
from one place to another, they come close to turning into a general
strike. And with the ideas of emancipation that now hold sway over the
proletariat, a general strike can result only in a great cataclysm which
forces society to shed its old skin."* He raised the possibility that
this could *"arrive before the proletariat is sufficiently organised"*
and dismissed it because the strikes expressed the self-organisation of
the workers for the *"necessities of the struggle impel the workers to
support one another"* and the *"more active the struggle becomes . . .
the stronger and more extensive this federation of proletarians must
become."* Thus strikes *"indicate a certain collective strength
already"* and *"each strike becomes the point of departure for the
formation of new groups."* He rejected the idea that a revolution could
be *"arbitrarily"* made by *"the most powerful associations."* Rather
they were produced by *"the force of circumstances."* As with the
syndicalists, Bakunin argued that not all workers needed to be in unions
before a general strike or revolution could take place. A minority
(perhaps *"one worker in ten")* needed to be organised and they would
influence the rest so ensuring *"at critical moments"* the majority
would *"follow the International's lead."* [**The Basic Bakunin**, pp.
149-50, p. 109 and p. 139]

As with the syndicalists, the new society would be organised *"by free
federation, from below upwards, of workers' associations, industrial as
well as agricultural . . . in districts and municipalities at first;
federation of these into regions, of the regions into nations, and the
nations into a fraternal Internationalism."* Moreover, *"capital,
factories, all the means of production and raw material"* would be owned
by *"the workers' organisations"* while the land would be given *"to
those who work it with their own hands."* [quoted by Kenafick, **Op.
Cit.**, p. 241 and p. 240] Compare this to the syndicalist CGT's 1906
**Charter of Amiens** which declared *"the trade union today is an
organisation of resistance"* but *"in the future [it will] be the
organisation of production and distribution, the basis of social
reorganisation."* [quoted by Wayne Thorpe, **"The Workers Themselves"**,
p. 201]

The similarities with revolutionary syndicalism could not be clearer.
Little wonder that all serious historians see the obvious similarities
between anarcho-syndicalism and Bakunin's anarchism. For example, George
R. Esenwein's (in his study of early Spanish anarchism) comments that
syndicalism *"had deep roots in the Spanish libertarian tradition. It
can be traced to Bakunin's revolutionary collectivism."* He also notes
that the class struggle was *"central to Bakunin's theory."*
[**Anarchist Ideology and the Working Class Movement in Spain,
1868-1898**, p. 209 and p. 20] Caroline Cahm, likewise, points to *"the
basic syndicalist ideas of Bakunin"* and that he *"argued that trade
union organisation and activity in the International [Working Men's
Association] were important in the building of working-class power in
the struggle against capital . . . He also declared that trade union
based organisation of the International would not only guide the
revolution but also provide the basis for the organisation of the
society of the future."* Indeed, he *"believed that trade unions had an
essential part to play in the developing of revolutionary capacities of
the workers as well as building up the organisation of the masses for
revolution."* [**Kropotkin and the Rise of Revolutionary Anarchism**, p.
219, p. 215 and p. 216] Paul Avrich, in his essay *"The Legacy of
Bakunin,"* agreed. *"Bakunin,"* he stated, *"perhaps even more than
Proudhon, was a prophet of revolutionary syndicalism, who believed that
a free federation of trade unions would be the 'living germs of a new
social order which is to replace the bourgeois world.'"* [**Anarchist
Portraits**, pp. 14-15] Bertrand Russell noted that *"[h]ardly any of
these ideas [associated with syndicalism] are new: almost all are
derived from the Bakunist [sic!] section of the old International"* and
that this was *"often recognised by Syndicalists themselves."* [**Roads
to Freedom**, p. 52] The syndicalists, notes Wayne Thorpe, *"identified
the First International with its federalist wing . . . [r]epresented . .
. initially by the Proudhonists and later and more influentially by the
Bakuninists."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 2]

Needless to say, anarchists agree with this perspective. Arthur Lehning,
for example, summarises the anarchist perspective when he commented that
*"Bakunin's collectivist anarchism . . . ultimately formed the
ideological and theoretical basis of anarcho-syndicalism."*
[*"Introduction"*, **Michael Bakunin: Selected Writings**, p. 29]
Anarchist academic David Berry also notes that *"anarchist syndicalist
were keen to establish a lineage with Bakunin . . . the anarchist
syndicalism of the turn of the century was a revival of a tactic"*
associated with *"the Bakuninist International."* [**A History of the
French Anarchist Movement, 1917-1945**, p. 17] Another, Mark Leier,
points out that *"the Wobblies drew heavily on anarchist ideas pioneered
by Bakunin."* [**Bakunin: The Creative Passion**, p. 298] Kropotkin
argued that syndicalism *"is nothing other than the rebirth of the
International - federalist, worker, Latin."* [quoted by Martin A.
Miller, **Kropotkin**, p. 176] Malatesta stated in 1907 that he had
*"never ceased to urge the comrades into that direction which the
syndicalists, forgetting the past, call **new**, even though it was
already glimpsed and followed, in the International, by the first of the
anarchists."* [**The Anarchist Reader**, p. 221] Little wonder that
Rudolf Rocker stated in his classic introduction to the subject that
anarcho-syndicalism was *"a direct continuation of those social
aspirations which took shape in the bosom of the First International and
which were best understood and most strongly held by the libertarian
wing of the great workers' alliance."* [**Anarcho-Syndicalism**, p. 54]
Murray Bookchin just stated the obvious:

> *"Long before syndicalism became a popular term in the French labour
> movement of the late [eighteen]nineties, it already existed in the
> Spanish labour movement of the early seventies. The
> anarchist-influenced Spanish Federation of the old IWMA was . . .
> distinctly syndicalist."* [*"Looking Back at Spain,"* pp. 53-96,
> Dimitrios I. Roussopoulos (ed.), **The Radical Papers**, p. 67]

Perhaps, in the face of such evidence (and the writings of Bakunin
himself), Marxists could claim that the sources we quote are either
anarchists or "sympathetic" to anarchism. To counter this is very easy,
we need only quote Marx and Engels. Marx attacked Bakunin for thinking
that the *"working class . . . must only organise themselves by
trades-unions"* and *"not occupy itself with **politics.**"* Engels
argued along the same lines, having a go at the anarchists because in
the *"Bakuninist programme a general strike is the lever employed by
which the social revolution is started"* and that they admitted *"this
required a well-formed organisation of the working class"* (i.e. a trade
union federation). Indeed, he summarised Bakunin's strategy as being to
*"organise, and when **all** the workers, hence the majority, are won
over, dispose all the authorities, abolish the state and replace it with
the organisation of the International."* [Marx, Engels and Lenin,
**Anarchism and Anarcho-Syndicalism**, p. 48, p. 132, p. 133 and p. 72]
Ignoring the misrepresentations of Marx and Engels about the ideas of
their enemies, we can state that they got the basic point of Bakunin's
ideas - the centrality of trade union organisation and struggle as well
as the use of strikes and the general strike. Therefore, you do not have
to read Bakunin to find out the similarities between his ideas and
syndicalism, you can read Marx and Engels. Clearly, most Marxist
critiques of anarchism have not even done that!

Latter anarchists, needless to say, supported the syndicalist movement
and, moreover, drew attention to its anarchist roots. Emma Goldman noted
that in the First International *"Bakunin and the Latin workers"* forged
ahead *"along industrial and Syndicalist lines"* and stated that
syndicalism *"is, in essence, the economic expression of Anarchism"* and
that *"accounts for the presence of so many Anarchists in the
Syndicalist movement. Like Anarchism, Syndicalism prepares the workers
along direct economic lines, as conscious factors in the great struggles
of to-day, as well as conscious factors in the task of reconstructing
society."* After seeing syndicalist ideas in action in France in 1900,
she *"immediately began to propagate Syndicalist ideas."* The *"most
powerful weapon"* for liberation was *"the conscious, intelligent,
organised, economic protest of the masses through direct action and the
general strike."* [**Red Emma Speaks**, p. 89, p. 91, p. 90 and p. 60]

Kropotkin argued anarchist communism *"wins more and more ground among
those working-men who try to get a clear conception as to the
forthcoming revolutionary action. The syndicalist and trade union
movements, which permit the workingmen to realise their solidarity and
to feel the community of their interests better than any election,
prepare the way for these conceptions."* [**Anarchism**, p. 174] His
support for anarchist participation in the labour movement was strong,
considering it a key method of preparing for a revolution and spreading
anarchist ideas amongst the working classes: *"The **syndicat** is
absolutely necessary. It is the sole force of the workers which
continues the direct struggle against capital without turning to
parliamentarism."* [quoted by Miller, **Op. Cit.**, p. 177]

*"Revolutionary Anarchist Communist propaganda within the Labour
Unions,"* Kropotkin stressed, *"had always been a favourite mode of
action in the Federalist or 'Bakuninist' section of the International
Working Men's Association. In Spain and in Italy it had been especially
successful. Now it was resorted to, with evident success, in France and
**Freedom** [the British Anarchist paper he helped create in 1886]
eagerly advocated this sort of propaganda."* [**Act For Yourselves**,
pp. 119-20] Caroline Cahm notes in her excellent account of Kropotkin's
ideas between 1872 and 1886, he *"was anxious to revive the
International as an organisation for aggressive strike action to
counteract the influence of parliamentary socialists on the labour
movement."* This resulted in Kropotkin advocating a *"remarkable fusion
of anarchist communist ideas with both the bakuninist [sic!]
internationalist views adopted by the Spanish Federation and the
syndicalist ideas developed in the Jura Federation in the 1870s."* This
included seeing the importance of revolutionary labour unions, the value
of the strikes as a mode of direct action and syndicalist action
developing solidarity. *"For Kropotkin,"* she summarises,
*"revolutionary syndicalism represented a revival of the great movement
of the Anti-authoritarian International . . . It seems likely that he
saw in it the [strikers International] which he had advocated earlier."*
[**Op. Cit.**, p. 257 and p. 268]

Clearly, any one claiming that there is a fundamental difference between
anarchism and syndicalism is talking nonsense. Syndicalist ideas were
being argued by the likes of Bakunin and Kropotkin before syndicalism
emerged in the French CGT in the 1890s as a clearly labelled
revolutionary theory. Rather than being in conflict, the ideas of
syndicalism find their roots in the ideas of Bakunin and "classical"
anarchism. This would be quickly seen if the actual writings of Bakunin
and Kropotkin were consulted. There **are,** of course, differences
between anarchism and syndicalism, but they are **not** those usually
listed by Marxists ([section J.3.9](secJ3.html#secj39) discusses these
differences and, as will quickly be discovered, they are **not** based
on a rejection of working class organisation, direct action, solidarity
and collective struggle!).

Ultimately, claims like Pat Stack's simply show how unfamiliar the
author is with the ideas they are pathetically attempting to critique.
Anarchists from Bakunin onwards shared most of the same ideas as
syndicalism (which is unsurprising as most of the ideas of
anarcho-syndicalism have direct roots in the ideas of Bakunin). In other
words, for Stack, the *"huge advantage"* anarcho-syndicalists have
*"over other anarchists"* is that they, in fact, share the same
*"understanding of the power of the working class, the centrality of the
point of production (the workplace) and the need for collective
action"*! This, in itself, shows the bankruptcy of Stack's claims and
those like it.

H.2.9 Do anarchists have *"liberal"* politics?
----------------------------------------------

Another assertion by Marxists is that anarchists have *"liberal"*
politics or ideas. For example, one Marxist argues that the *"programme
with which Bakunin armed his super-revolutionary vanguard called for the
'political, economic and social equalisation of classes and individuals
of both sexes, beginning with the abolition of the right of
inheritance.' This is **liberal** politics, implying nothing about the
abolition of capitalism."* [Derek Howl, *"The Legacy of Hal Draper,"*
pp. 137-49, **International Socialism**, no. 52, p. 148]

That Howl is totally distorting Bakunin's ideas can quickly be seen by
looking at the whole of the programme. The passage quoted is from item 2
of the *"Programme of the Alliance."* Strangely Howle fails to quote the
end of that item, namely when it states this *"equalisation"* was *"in
pursuance of the decision reached by the last working men's Congress in
Brussels, the land, the instruments of work and all other capital may
become the collective property of the whole of society and be utilised
only by the workers, in other words by the agricultural and industrial
associations."* If this was not enough to indicate the abolition of
capitalism, item 4 states that the Alliance *"repudiates all political
action whose target is anything except the triumph of the workers' cause
over Capital."* [**Michael Bakunin: Selected Writings**, p. 174]

Howl's dishonesty is clear. Bakunin **explicitly** argued for the
abolition of capitalism in the same item Howl (selectively) quotes from.
If the socialisation of land and capital under the control of workers'
associations is not the abolition of capitalism, we wonder what is!

Equally as dishonest as this quoting out of context is Howl's
non-mention of the history of the expression *"political, economic and
social equalisation of classes and individuals of both sexes."* After
Bakunin sent the Alliance programme to the General Council of the
**International Workingmen's Association**, he received a letter date
March 9, 1869 from Marx which stated that the term *"the equalisation of
classes"* *"literally interpreted"* would mean *"harmony of capital and
labour"* as *"persistently preached by the bourgeois socialists."* The
letter argued that it was *"not the logically impossible 'equalisation
of classes', but the historically necessary, superseding 'abolition of
classes'"* which was the *"true secret of the proletarian movement"* and
which *"forms the great aim of the International Working Men's
Association."* Significantly, the letter adds the following:

> *"Considering, however, the context in which that phrase 'equalisation
> of classes' occurs, it seems to be a mere slip of the pen, and the
> General Council feels confident that you will be anxious to remove
> from your program an expression which offers such a dangerous
> misunderstanding."* [**Collected Works**, vol. 21, p. 46]

And, given the context, Marx was right. The phrase *"equalisation of
classes"* placed in the context of the political, economic and social
equalisation of individuals obviously implies the abolition of classes.
The logic is simple. If both worker and capitalist shared the same
economic and social position then wage labour would not exist (in fact,
it would be impossible as it is based on social and economic
**inequality**) and so class society would not exist. Similarly, if the
tenant and the landlord were socially equal then the landlord would have
no power over the tenant, which would be impossible. Bakunin agreed with
Marx on the ambiguity of the term and the Alliance changed its Programme
to call for *"the final and total abolition of classes and the
political, economic and social equalisation of individuals of either
sex."* [Bakunin, **Op. Cit.** p. 174] This change ensured the admittance
of the Alliance sections into the International Workingmen's Association
(although this did not stop Marx, like his followers, bringing up this
*"mere slip of the pen"* years later). However, Howl repeating the
changed phrase *"equalisation of classes"* out of context helps
discredit anarchism and so it is done.

Simply put, anarchists are **not** liberals. We are well aware of the
fact that without equality, liberty is impossible except for the rich.
As Nicolas Walter put it, *"[l]ike liberals, anarchists want freedom;
like socialists, anarchists want equality. But we are not satisfied by
liberalism alone or by socialism alone. Freedom without equality means
that the poor and weak are less free than the rich and strong, and
equality without freedom means that we are all slaves together. Freedom
and equality are not contradictory, but complementary; in place of the
old polarisation of freedom versus equality - according to which we are
told that more freedom equals less equality, and more equality equals
less freedom - anarchists point out that in practice you cannot have one
without the other. Freedom is not genuine if some people are too poor or
too weak to enjoy it, and equality is not genuine is some people are
ruled by others."* [**About Anarchism**, p. 29] Clearly, anarchists do
**not** have liberal politics. Quite the reverse, as we subject it to
extensive critique from a working class perspective.

To the claim that anarchism *"combines a socialist critique of
capitalism with a liberal critique of socialism,"* anarchists reply that
it is mistaken. [Paul Thomas, **Karl Marx and the Anarchists**, p. 7]
Rather, anarchism is simply a socialist critique of both capitalism and
the state. Freedom under capitalism is fatally undermined by inequality
- it simply becomes the freedom to pick a master. This violates liberty
and equality, as does the state. *"Any State at all,"* argued Bakunin,
*"no matter what kind, is a domination and exploitation. It is a
negation of Socialism, which wants an equitable human society delivered
from all tutelage, from all authority and political domination as well
as economic exploitation."* [quoted by Kenafick, **Op. Cit.**, pp. 95-6]
As such, state structures violate not only liberty but also equality.
There is no real equality in power between, say, the head of the
government and one of the millions who may, or may not, have voted for
them. As the Russian Revolution proved, there can be no meaningful
equality between a striking worker and the "socialist" political police
sent to impose the will of the state, i.e., the "socialist" ruling
elite.

This means that if anarchists are concerned about freedom (both
individual **and** collective) it is not because we are influenced by
liberalism. Quite the reverse, as liberalism happily tolerates hierarchy
and the restrictions of liberty implied by private property, wage labour
and the state. As Bakunin argued, capitalism turns *"the worker into a
subordinate, a passive and obedient servant."* [**The Political
Philosophy of Bakunin**, p. 188] So anarchism rejects liberalism
(although, as Bakunin put it, *"[i]f socialism disputes radicalism, this
is hardly to reverse it but rather to advance it."* [**The Basic
Bakunin**, p. 87]). Therefore, anarchism rejects liberalism, not because
it supports the idea of freedom, but precisely because it does not go
far enough and fails to understand that without equality, freedom is
little more than freedom for the master. In fact, as we argue in
[section H.4](secH4.html), it is Marxism itself which has a distinctly
liberal perspective of freedom, seeing it restricted by association
rather than association being an expression of it.

Lastly, a few words on the mentality that could suggest that anarchist
concern for liberty means that it is a form of liberalism. Rather than
suggest the bankruptcy of anarchism it, in fact, suggests the bankruptcy
of the politics of the person making the accusation. After all, the
clear implication is that a concern with individual, collective and
social freedom is alien to socialist ideas. It also strikes at the heart
of socialism - its concern for equality - as it clearly implies that
some have more power (namely the right to suppress the liberty of
others) than the rest. As such, it suggests a superficial understanding
of **real** socialism (see also our discussion of Marxist claims about
anarchist "elitism" in [section H.2.11](secH2.html#sech211)).

To argue that a concern for freedom means *"liberalism"* (or, equally,
*"individualism"*) indicates that the person is not a socialist. After
all, a concern that every individual controls their daily lives (i.e. to
be free) means a wholehearted support for collective self-management of
group affairs. It means a vision of a revolution (and post-revolutionary
society) based on direct working class participation and management of
society from below upwards. To dismiss this vision by dismissing the
principles which inspire it as *"liberalism"* means to support rule from
above by the "enlightened" elite (i.e. the party) and the hierarchical
state structures. It means arguing for **party** power, not **class**
power, as liberty is seen as a **danger** to the revolution and so the
people must be protected against the "petty-bourgeois"/"reactionary"
narrowness of the people (to requote Bakunin, *"every state, even the
pseudo-People's State concocted by Mr. Marx, is in essence only a
machine ruling the masses from above, through a privileged minority of
conceited intellectuals who imagine that they know what the people need
and want better than do the people themselves."* [**Bakunin on
Anarchism**, p. 338]). Rather than seeing free debate of ideas and mass
participation as a source of strength, it sees it as a source of "bad
influences" which the masses must be protected from.

Moreover, it suggests a total lack of understanding of the difficulties
that a social revolution will face. Unless it is based on the active
participation of the majority of a population, any revolution will fail.
The construction of socialism, of a new society, will face thousands of
unexpected problems and seek to meet the needs of millions of
individuals, thousands of communities and hundreds of cultures. Without
the individuals and groups within that society being in a position to
freely contribute to that constructive task, it will simply wither under
the bureaucratic and authoritarian rule of a few party leaders. As such,
individual liberties are an essential aspect of **genuine** social
reconstruction - without freedom of association, assembly, organisation,
speech and so on, the active participation of the masses will be
replaced by an isolated and atomised collective of individuals subjected
to autocratic rule from above.

As ex-anarchist turned Bolshevik Victor Serge concluded in the late
1930s (when it was far too late) the *"fear of liberty, which is the
fear of the masses, marks almost the entire course of the Russian
Revolution. If it is possible to discover a major lesson, capable of
revitalising Marxism . . . one might formulate it in these terms:
Socialism is essentially democratic -- the word, 'democratic', being
used here in its libertarian sense."* [**The Serge-Trotsky Papers**, p.
181]

Ultimately, as Rudolf Rocker suggested, the *"urge for social justice
can only develop properly and be effective, when it grows out of man's
sense of personal freedom and it based on that. In other words
**Socialism will be free, or it will not be at all.** In its recognition
of this lies the genuine and profound justification for the existence of
Anarchism."* [**Anarcho-Syndicalism**, p. 14]

H.2.10 Are anarchists against leadership?
-----------------------------------------

It is a common assertion by Marxists that anarchists reject the idea of
*"leadership"* and so think in terms of a totally spontaneous
revolution. This is also generally understood to imply that anarchists
do not see the need for revolutionaries to organise together to
influence the class struggle in the here and now. Hence the British
SWP's Duncan Hallas:

> *"That an organisation of socialist militants is necessary is common
> ground on the left, a few anarchist purists apart. But what kind of
> organisation? One view, widespread amongst newly radicalised students
> and young workers, is that of the libertarians . . . [They have]
> hostility to centralised, co-ordinated activity and profound suspicion
> of anything smacking of 'leadership.' On this view nothing more than a
> loose federation of working groups is necessary or desirable. The
> underlying assumptions are that centralised organisations inevitably
> undergo bureaucratic degeneration and that the spontaneous activities
> of working people are the sole and sufficient basis for the
> achievement of socialism . . . some libertarians draw the conclusion
> that a revolutionary socialist party is a contradiction in terms.
> This, of course, is the traditional anarcho-syndicalist position."*
> [**Towards a revolutionary socialist party**, p. 39]

Ignoring the usual patronising references to the age and experience of
non-Leninists, this argument can be faulted on many levels. Firstly,
while libertarians do reject centralised structures, it does **not**
mean we reject co-ordinated activity. This may be a common Marxist
argument, but it is a straw man one. Secondly, anarchists do **not**
reject the idea of *"leadership."* We simply reject the idea of
hierarchical leadership. Thirdly, while all anarchists do think that a
*"revolutionary socialist party"* is a contradiction in terms, it does
not mean that we reject the need for revolutionary organisations (i.e.
organisations of anarchists). While opposing centralised and
hierarchical political parties, anarchists have long saw the need for
anarchist groups and federations to discuss and spread our ideas and
influence. We will discuss each issue in turn.

The first argument is the least important. For Marxists, co-ordination
equals centralism and to reject centralisation means to reject
co-ordination of joint activity. For anarchists, co-ordination does not
each centralism or centralisation. This is why anarchism stresses
federation and federalism as the means of co-ordinating joint activity.
Under a centralised system, the affairs of all are handed over to a
handful of people at the centre. Their decisions are then binding on the
mass of the members of the organisation whose position is simply that of
executing the orders of those whom the majority elect. This means that
power rests at the top and decisions flow from the top downwards. As
such, the "revolutionary" party simply mimics the very society it claims
to oppose (see [section H.5.6](secH5.html#sech56)) as well as being
extremely ineffective (see [section H.5.8](secH5.html#sech58))

In a federal structure, in contrast, decisions flow from the bottom up
by means of councils of elected, mandated and recallable **delegates**.
In fact, we discover anarchists like Bakunin and Proudhon arguing for
elected, mandated and recallable delegates rather than for
representatives in their ideas of how a free society worked years before
the Paris Commune applied them in practice. The federal structure exists
to ensure that any co-ordinated activity accurately reflects the
decisions of the membership. As such, anarchists *"do not deny the need
for co-ordination between groups, for discipline, for meticulous
planning, and for unity in action. But they believe that co-ordination,
discipline, planning, and unity in action must be achieved
**voluntarily,** by means of a self-discipline nourished by conviction
and understanding, not by coercion and a mindless, unquestioning
obedience to orders from above."* This means we *"vigorously oppose the
establishment of an organisational structure that becomes an end in
itself, of committees that linger on after their practical tasks have
been completed, of a 'leadership' that reduces the 'revolutionary' to a
mindless robot."* [Murray Bookchin, **Post-Scarcity Anarchism**, p. 139]
In other words, co-ordination comes ***from below*** rather than being
imposed from above by a few leaders. To use an analogy, federalist
co-ordination is the co-ordination created in a strike by workers
resisting their bosses. It is created by debate amongst equals and flows
from below upwards. Centralised co-ordination is the co-ordination
imposed from the top-down by the boss.

Secondly, anarchists are not against all forms of *"leadership."* We are
against hierarchical and institutionalised forms of leadership. In other
words, of giving **power** to leaders. This is the key difference, as
Albert Meltzer explained. *"In any grouping some people,"* he argued,
*"do naturally 'give a lead.' But this should not mean they are a class
apart. What they always reject is institutionalised leadership. That
means their supporters become blind followers and the leadership not one
of example or originality but of unthinking acceptance."* Any
revolutionary in a factory where the majority have no revolutionary
experience, will at times, "give a lead." However, *"no real Anarchist .
. . would agree to be part of an **institutionalised leadership.**
Neither would an Anarchist wait for a lead, but give one."*
[**Anarchism: Arguments for and against**, p. 58 and p. 59]

This means, as we argue in [section J.3.6](secJ3.html#secj36), that
anarchists seek to influence the class struggle as **equals.** Rather
than aim for positions of power, anarchists want to influence people by
the power of their ideas as expressed in the debates that occur in the
organisations created in the social struggle itself. This is because
anarchists recognise that there is an unevenness in the level of ideas
within the working class. This fact is obvious. Some workers accept the
logic of the current system, others are critical of certain aspects,
others (usually a minority) are consciously seeking a better society
(and are anarchists, ecologists, Marxists, etc.) and so on. Only
constant discussion, the clash of ideas, combined with collective
struggle can develop political awareness and narrow the unevenness of
ideas within the oppressed. As Malatesta argued, *"[o]nly freedom or the
struggle for freedom can be the school for freedom."* [**Errico
Malatesta: His Life and Ideas**, p. 59]

From this perspective, it follows that any attempt to create an
institutionalised leadership structure means the end of the
revolutionary process. Such "leadership" automatically means a
hierarchical structure, one in which the leaders have power and make the
decisions for the rest. This just reproduces the old class division of
labour between those who think and those who act (i.e. between order
givers and order takers). Rather than the revolutionary masses taking
power in such a system, it is the "leaders" (i.e. a specific party
hierarchy) who do so and the masses role becomes, yet again, simply that
of selecting which boss tells them what to do.

So the anarchist federation does not reject the need of "leadership" in
the sense of giving a led, of arguing its ideas and trying to win people
to them. It does reject the idea that "leadership" should become
separated from the mass of the people. Simply put, no party, no group of
leaders have all the answers and so the active participation of all is
required for a successful revolution. It is not a question of
organisation versus non-organisation, or "leadership" versus
non-"leadership" but rather what ***kind*** of organisation and the
***kind*** of leadership.

Clearly, then, anarchists do not reject or dismiss the importance of
politically aware minorities organising and spreading their ideas within
social struggles. As Caroline Cahm summarised in her excellent study of
Kropotkin's thought, *"Kropotkin stressed the role of heroic minorities
in the preparation for revolution."* [**Kropotkin and the Rise of
Revolutionary Anarchism, 1872-86**, p. 276] Yet, as John Crump correctly
argued, the *"key words here are **in the preparation for revolution.**
By their courage and daring in opposing capitalism and the state,
anarchist minorities could teach by example and thereby draw increasing
numbers into the struggle. But Kropotkin was not advocating
substitutionism; the idea that a minority might carry out the revolution
in place of the people was as alien to him as the notion that a minority
would exercise rule after the revolution. In fact, Kropotkin recognised
that the former would be a prescription for the latter."* [**Hatta Shuzo
and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan**, p. 9] In Kropotkin's own words:

> *"The idea of anarchist communism, today represented by feeble
> minorities, but increasingly finding popular expression, will make its
> way among the mass of the people. Spreading everywhere, the anarchist
> groups . . . will take strength from the support they find among the
> people, and will raise the red flag of the revolution . . . On that
> day, what is now the minority will become the People, the great mass,
> and that mass rising against property and the State, will march
> forward towards anarchist communism."* [**Words of a Rebel**, p. 75]

This influence would be gained simply by the correctness of our ideas
and the validity of our suggestions. This means that anarchists seek
influence *"through advice and example, leaving the people . . . to
adopt our methods and solutions if these are, or seem to be, better than
those suggested and carried out by others."* As such, any anarchist
organisation would *"strive acquire overwhelming influence in order to
draw the [revolutionary] movement towards the realisation of our ideas.
But such influence must be won by doing more and better than others, and
will be useful if won in that way."* This means rejecting *"taking over
command, that is by becoming a government and imposing one's own ideas
and interests through police methods."* [Malatesta, **The Anarchist
Revolution**, pp. 108-9]

Moreover, unlike leading Marxists like Lenin and Karl Kautsky,
anarchists think that socialist ideas are developed **within** the class
struggle rather than outside it by the radical intelligentsia (see
[section H.5](secH5.html)). Kropotkin argued that *"modern socialism has
emerged out of the depths of the people's consciousness. If a few
thinkers emerging from the bourgeoisie have given it the approval of
science and the support of philosophy, the basis of the idea which they
have given their own expression has nonetheless been the product of the
collective spirit of the working people. The rational socialism of the
International is still today our greatest strength, and it was
elaborated in working class organisation, under the first influence of
the masses. The few writers who offered their help in the work of
elaborating socialist ideas have merely been giving form to the
aspirations that first saw their light among the workers."* [**Op.
Cit.**, p. 59] In other words, anarchists are a part of the working
class (either by birth or by rejecting their previous class background
and becoming part of it), the part which has generalised its own
experiences, ideas and needs into a theory called *"anarchism"* and
seeks to convince the rest of the validity of its ideas and tactics.
This would be a dialogue, based on both learning **and** teaching.

As such, this means that the relationship between the specifically
anarchist groups and oppressed peoples in struggle is a two way one. As
well as trying to influence the social struggle, anarchists also try and
learn from the class struggle and try to generalise from the experiences
of their own struggles and the struggles of other working class people.
Rather than seeing the anarchist group as some sort of teacher,
anarchists see it as simply part of the social struggle and its ideas
can and must develop from active participation within that struggle. As
anarchists agree with Bakunin and reject the idea that their
organisations should take power on behalf of the masses, it is clear
that such groups are not imposing alien ideas upon people but rather try
to clarify the ideas generated by working class people in struggle. It
is an objective fact that there is a great difference in the political
awareness within the masses of oppressed people. This uneven development
means that they do not accept, all at once or in their totality,
revolutionary ideas. There are layers. Groups of people, by ones and
twos and then in larger numbers, become interested, read literature,
talk with others, and create new ideas. The first groups that explicitly
call their ideas *"anarchism"* have the right and duty to try to
persuade others to join them. This is not opposed to the
self-organisation of the working class, rather it is how working class
people self-organise.

Lastly, most anarchists recognise the need to create specifically
anarchist organisations to spread anarchist ideas and influence the
class struggle. Suffice to say, the idea that anarchists reject this
need to organise politically in order to achieve a revolution is not to
be found in the theory and practice of all the major anarchist thinkers
nor in the history and current practice of the anarchist movement
itself. As Leninists themselves, at times, admit. Ultimately, if
spontaneity was enough to create (and ensure the success of) a social
revolution then we would be living in a libertarian socialist society.
The fact that we are not suggests that spontaneity, however important,
is not enough in itself. This simple fact of history is understood by
anarchists and we organise ourselves appropriately.

See [section J.3](secJ3.html) for more details on what organisations
anarchists create and their role in anarchist revolutionary theory
([Section J.3.6](secJ3.html#secj36), for example, has a fuller
discussion of the role of anarchist groups in the class struggle). For a
discussion of the role of anarchists in a revolution, see [section
J.7.5](secJ7.html#secj75).

H.2.11 Are anarchists *"anti-democratic"*?
------------------------------------------

One of the common arguments against anarchism is that it is
*"anti-democratic"* (or *"elitist"*). For example, a member of the
British **Socialist Workers Party** denounces anarchism for being
*"necessarily deeply anti-democratic"* due to its *"thesis of the
absolute sovereignty of the individual ego as against the imposition of
**any** 'authority' over it,"* which, its is claimed, is the
*"distinctly anarchist concept."* This position is an *"idealist
conception"* in which *"**any** authority is seen as despotic; 'freedom'
and 'authority' (and therefore 'freedom' and 'democracy') are opposites.
This presumption of opposition to 'authority' was fostered by
liberalism."* This is contrasted with the Marxist *"materialist
understanding of society"* in which it *"was clear that 'authority' is
necessary in **any** society where labour is collaborative."* [Derek
Howl, *"The Legacy of Hal Draper,"* pp. 137-49, **International
Socialism**, no. 52, p. 145] Hal Draper is quoted arguing that:

> *By the 'principle of authority' the consistent anarchist means
> principled opposition to any exercise of authority, including
> opposition to authority derived from the most complete democracy and
> exercised in completely democratic fashion . . . Of all ideologies,
> anarchism is the one most fundamentally anti-democratic in principle,
> since it is not only unalterably hostile to democracy in general but
> particularly to any socialist democracy of the most ideal kind that
> could be imagined."*

Such as argument is, of course, just ridiculous. Indeed, it is flawed on
so many levels its hard to know where to start. The obvious place is the
claim that anarchism is the most *"fundamentally anti-democratic in
principle."* Now, given that there are fascists, monarchists, supporters
(like Trotsky) of *"party dictatorship"* and a host of others who
advocate minority rule (even by one person) over everyone else, can it
be argued with a straight face that anarchism is the most
*"anti-democratic"* because it argues for the liberty of all? Is the
idea and practice of absolute monarchy and fascism **really** more
democratic than anarchism? Clearly not, although this does indicate the
quality of this kind of argument. Equally, the notion that liberalism
rests on a *"presumption of opposition to 'authority'"* cannot be
supported by even a casual understanding of the subject. That ideology
has always sought ways to justify the authority structures of the
liberal state not to mention the hierarchies produced by capitalist
private property. So the notion that liberalism is against "authority"
is hard to square with both its theory and reality.

Another obvious point is that anarchists do not see **any** authority as
*"despotic."* As we discuss in [section H.4](secH4.html), this common
Marxist assertion is simply not true. Anarchists have always been very
clear on the fact they reject specific kinds of authority and not
*"authority"* as such. In fact, by the term *"principal of authority,"*
Bakunin meant **hierarchical** authority, and not all forms of
*"authority"*. This explains why Kropotkin argued that *"the origin of
the anarchist conception of society"* lies in *"the criticism"* of the
*"hierarchical organisations and the authoritarian conceptions of
society"* and stressed that anarchism *"refuses all hierarchical
organisation."* [**Anarchism**, p. 158 and p. 137]

This means, just to state the obvious, that making and sticking by
collective decisions are **not** acts of authority. Rather they simply
expressions of individual autonomy. Clearly in most activities there is
a need to co-operate with other people. Indeed, **living** involves the
*"absolute sovereignty of the individual ego"* (as if anarchists like
Bakunin used such terms!) being *"restricted"* by exercising that
*"sovereignty."* Take, for example, playing football. This involves
finding others who seek to play the game, organising into teams,
agreeing on rules and so on. All terrible violations of the *"absolute
sovereignty of the individual ego,"* yet it was precisely the
*"sovereignty"* of the *"individual"* which produced the desire to play
the game in the first place. What sort of *"sovereignty"* is it that
negates itself when it is exercised? Clearly, then, the Marxist
"summary" of anarchist ideas on this matter, like of many others, is
poverty stricken.

And, unsurprisingly enough, we find anarchist thinkers like Bakunin and
Kropotkin attacking this idea of *"the absolute sovereignty of the
individual ego"* in the most severe terms. Indeed, they thought was a
bourgeois theory which simply existed to justify the continued
domination and exploitation of working class people by the ruling class.
Kropotkin quite clearly recognised its anti-individual and unfree nature
by labelling it *"the authoritarian individualism which stifles us"* and
stressing its *"narrow-minded, and therefore foolish"* nature.
[**Conquest of Bread**, p. 130] Similarly, it would do the Marxist
argument little good if they quoted Bakunin arguing that the *"freedom
of individuals is by no means an individual matter. It is a collective
matter, a collective product. No individual can be free outside of human
society or without its co-operation"* or that he considered
*"individualism"* as a *"bourgeois principle."* [**The Basic Bakunin**,
p. 46 and p. 57] He had nothing but contempt for, as he put it, *"that
individualistic, egotistical, malicious and illusory freedom"* which was
*"extolled"* by all the *"schools of bourgeois liberalism."* [**Michael
Bakunin: Selected Writings**, p. 196]

Perhaps, of course, these two famous anarchists were not, in fact,
*"consistent"* anarchists, but that claim is doubtful.

The notion that anarchism is inherently an extreme form of
"individualism" seems to be the great assumption of Marxism. Hence the
continual repetition of this "fact" and the continual attempt to link
revolutionary anarchism with Stirner's ideas (the only anarchist to
stress the importance of the *"ego"*). Thus we find Engels talking about
*"Stirner, the great prophet of contemporary anarchism - Bakunin has
taken a great deal from him . . . Bakunin blended [Stirner] with
Proudhon and labelled the blend 'anarchism'"* For Marx, *"Bakunin has
merely translated Proudhon's and Stirner's anarchy into the crude
language of the Tartars."* [Marx, Engels and Lenin, **Anarchism and
Anarcho-Syndicalism**, p. 175 and p. 153] In reality, of course, Stirner
was essentially unknown to the anarchist movement until his book was
rediscovered in the late nineteenth century and even then his impact was
limited. In terms of Bakunin, while his debt to Proudhon is well known
and obvious, the link with Stirner seems to have existed only in the
heads of Marx and Engels. As Mark Leier notes, *"there is no evidence of
this . . . Bakunin mentions Stirner precisely once in his collected
works, and then only in passing . . . as far as can be determined,
Bakunin had no interest, even a negative one, in Stirner's ideas."*
[**Bakunin: The Creative Passion**, p. 97] Nor was Proudhon influenced
by Stirner (it is doubtful he even knew of him) while Stirner criticised
the French anarchist. Does that mean Stirner is the only "consistent"
anarchist? Moreover, even in terms of Stirner, Marxist diatribes about
the *"absolute sovereignty of the individual ego"* fail to note that the
egoist himself advocated organisation (*"the union of egos"*) and was
well aware that it required agreements between individuals which, in the
abstract, reduced "liberty" (the union *"offer[s] a greater measure of
liberty"* while containing a lesser amount of *"unfreedom"* [**The Ego
and Its Own**, p. 308]).

Anarchism does, of course, derive from the Greek for *"without
authority"* or *"without rulers"* and this, unsurprisingly, informs
anarchist theory and visions of a better world. This means that
anarchism is against the *"domination of man by man"* (and woman by
woman, woman by man, and so on). However, *"[a]s knowledge has
penetrated the governed masses . . . the people have revolted against
the form of authority then felt most intolerable. This spirit of revolt
in the individual and the masses, is the natural and necessary fruit of
the spirit of domination; the vindication of human dignity, and the
saviour of social life."* Thus *"freedom is the necessary preliminary to
any true and equal human association."* [Charlotte Wilson, **Anarchist
Essays**, p. 54 and p. 40] In other words, anarchism comes from the
struggle of the oppressed against their rulers and is an expression of
individual and social freedom. Anarchism was born from the class
struggle.

Taking individual liberty as a good thing, the next question is how do
free individuals co-operate together in such a way as to ensure their
continued liberty (*"The belief in freedom assumes that human beings can
co-operate."* [Emma Goldman, **Red Emma Speaks**, p. 442]). This
suggests that any association must be one of equality between the
associating individuals. This can only be done when everyone involved
takes a meaningful role in the decision making process and because of
this anarchists stress the need for **self-government** (usually called
***self-management***) of both individuals and groups. Self-management
within free associations and decision making from the bottom-up is the
only way domination can be eliminated. This is because, by making our
own decisions ourselves, we automatically end the division of society
into governors and governed (i.e. end hierarchy). As Anarchism clearly
means support for freedom and equality, it automatically implies
opposition to all forms of hierarchical organisation and authoritarian
social relationship. This means that anarchist support for individual
liberty does not end, as many Marxists assert, in the denial of
organisation or collective decision making but rather in support for
**self-managed** groups. Only this form of organisation can end the
division of society into rulers and ruled, oppressor and oppressed,
exploiter and exploited and create an environment in which individuals
can associate without denying their freedom and equality.

Therefore, the **positive** side of anarchism (which naturally flows
from its opposition to authority) results in a political theory which
argues that people must control their own struggles, organisations and
affairs directly. This means we support mass assemblies and their
federation via councils of mandated delegates subject to recall if they
break their mandates (i.e. they act as they see fit, i.e. as politicians
or bureaucrats, and not as the people who elected them desire). This way
people directly govern themselves and control their own lives, allowing
those affected by a decision to have a say in it and so they manage
their own affairs directly and without hierarchy. Rather than imply an
"individualism" which denies the importance of association and the
freedom it can generate, anarchism implies an opposition to hierarchy in
all its forms and the support free association of equals. In other
words, anarchism can generally be taken to mean support for
self-government or self-management, both by individuals and by groups.

In summary, anarchist support for individual liberty incurs a similar
support for self-managed groups. In such groups, individuals co-operate
as equals to maximise their liberty. This means, for anarchists,
Marxists are just confusing co-operation with coercion, agreement with
authority, association with subordination. Thus the Marxist
*"materialist"* concept of authority distorts the anarchist position
and, secondly, is supra-historical in the extreme. Different forms of
decision making are lumped together, independent of the various forms it
may assume. To equate hierarchical and self-managed decision making,
antagonistic and harmonious forms of organisation, alienated authority
or authority retained in the hands of those directly affected by it, can
only be a source of confusion. Rather than being a *"materialistic"*
approach, the Marxist one is pure philosophical idealism - the
postulating of a-historic concepts independently of the individuals and
societies that generate specific social relationships and ways of
working together.

Similarly, it would be churlish to note that Marxists themselves have
habitually rejected democratic authority when it suited them. Even that
*"higher type of democracy"* of the soviets was ignored by the Bolshevik
party once it was in power. As we discuss in [section
H.6.1](secH6.html#sech61), faced with the election of non-Bolshevik
majorities to the soviets, Bolshevik armed force was used to overthrow
the results. In addition, they also gerrymanderd soviets once they could
not longer count on an electoral majority. In the workplace, the
Bolsheviks replaced workers' economic democracy with *"one-man
management"* appointed from above, by the state, armed with
*"dictatorial power"* (see [section H.3.14](secH3.html#sech314)). As
discussed in [section H.3.8](secH3.html#sech38), the Bolsheviks
generalised their experiences exercising power into explicit support for
party dictatorship. Throughout the 1920s and 30s, Trotsky repeated this
conclusion and repeated advocated party dictatorship, urging the party
to use its power to crush opposition in the working class to its rule.
For the Bolshevik tradition, the power of the party to ignore the wishes
of the class it claims to represent is a fundamental ideological
position.

So, remember when Lenin or Trotsky argue for *"party dictatorship"*, the
over-riding of the democratic decisions of the masses by the party, the
elimination of workers factory committees in favour of appointed
managers armed with *"dictatorial"* power or when the Bolshevik
disbanded soviets with non-Bolshevik majorities, it is **anarchism**
which is fundamentally *"anti-democratic"*! All in all, that anyone can
claim that anarchism is more *"anti-democratic"* than Leninism is a
joke.

However, all these anti-democratic acts do fit in nicely with Howl's
*"materialist"* Marxist concept that *"'authority' is necessary in
**any** society where labour is collaborative."* Since *"authority"* is
essential and all forms of collective decision making are necessarily
*"authoritarian"* and involve *"subordination,"* then it clearly does
not really matter how collectives are organised and how decisions are
reached. Hence the lack of concern for the liberty of the working people
subjected to the (peculiarly bourgeois-like) forms of authority
preferred by Lenin and Trotsky. It was precisely for this reason, to
differentiate between egalitarian (and so libertarian) forms of
organisation and decision making and authoritarian ones, that anarchists
called themselves *"anti-authoritarians."*

Even if we ignore all the anti-democratic acts of Bolshevism (or justify
them in terms of the problems facing the Russian Revolution, as most
Leninists do), the anti-democratic nature of Leninist ideas still come
to the fore. The Leninist support for centralised state power brings
their attack on anarchism as being *"anti-democratic"* into clear
perspective and, ultimately, results in the affairs of millions being
decided upon by a handful of people in the Central Committee of the
vanguard party. As an example, we will discuss Trotsky's arguments
against the Makhnovist movement in the Ukraine.

For Trotsky, the Makhnovists were against *"Soviet power."* This, he
argued, was simply *"the authority of all the local soviets in the
Ukraine"* as they all *"recognise the central power which they
themselves have elected."* Consequently, the Makhnovists rejected not
only central authority but also the local soviets as well. Trotsky also
suggested that there were no *"appointed"* persons in Russia as *"there
is no authority in Russia but that which is elected by the whole working
class and working peasantry. It follows [!] that commanders appointed by
the central Soviet Government are installed in their positions by the
will of the working millions."* He stressed that one can speak of
*"appointed"* persons *"only under the bourgeois order, when Tsarist
officials or bourgeois ministers appointed at their own discretion
commanders who kept the soldier masses subject to the bourgeois
classes."* When the Makhnovists tried to call the fourth regional
conference of peasants, workers and partisans to discuss the progress of
the Civil War in early 1919, Trotsky, unsurprisingly enough,
*"categorically banned"* it. With typical elitism, he noted that the
Makhnovist movement had *"its roots in the ignorant masses"*! [**How the
Revolution Armed**, vol. II, p. 277, p. 280, p. 295 and p. 302]

In other words, because the Bolshevik government had been given power by
a national Soviet Congress in the past (and only remained there by
gerrymandering and disbanding soviets), he (as its representative) had
the right to ban a conference which would have expressed the wishes of
millions of workers, peasants and partisans fighting for the revolution!
The fallacious nature of his arguments is easily seen. Rather than
executing the will of millions of toilers, Trotsky was simply executing
his own will. He did not consult those millions nor the local soviets
which had, in Bolshevik ideology, surrendered their power to the handful
of people in the central committee of the Bolshevik Party. By banning
the conference he was very effectively undermining the practical,
functional democracy of millions and replacing it with a purely formal
"democracy" based on empowering a few leaders at the centre. Yes,
indeed, truly democracy in action when one person can deny a
revolutionary people its right to decide its own fate!

Unsurprisingly, the anarchist Nestor Makhno replied by arguing that he
considered it *"an inviolable right of the workers and peasants, a right
won by the revolution, to call congresses on their own account, to
discuss their affairs. That is why the prohibition by the central
authorities on the calling of such congresses . . . represent a direct
and insolent violation of the rights of the workers."* [quoted by Peter
Arshinov, **The History of the Makhnovist Movement**, p. 129] We will
leave it to the readers to decide which of the two, Trotsky or Makhno,
showed the fundamentally *"anti-democratic"* perspective.

Moreover, there are a few theoretical issues that need to be raised on
this matter. Notice, for example, that no attempt is made to answer the
simple question of why having 51% of a group automatically makes you
right! It is taken for granted that the minority should subject
themselves to the will of the majority before that will is even decided
upon. Does that mean, for example, that Marxists refuse minorities the
right of civil disobedience if the majority acts in a way which harms
their liberties and equality? If, for example, the majority in community
decides to implement race laws, does that mean that Marxists would
**oppose** the discriminated minority taking direct action to undermine
and abolish them? Or, to take an example closer to Marxism, in 1914 the
leaders of the Social Democratic Party in the German Parliament voted
for war credits. The anti-war minority of that group went along with the
majority in the name of "democracy," "unity" and "discipline". Would
Howl and Draper argue that they were right to do so? If they were not
right to betray the ideas of Marxism and international working class
solidarity, then why not? They did, after all, subject themselves to the
*"most perfect socialist democracy"* and so, presumably, made the
correct decision.

Simply put, the arguments that anarchists are *"anti-democratic"* are
question-begging in the extreme, when not simply hypocritical.

As a general rule-of-thumb, anarchists have little problem with the
minority accepting the decisions of the majority after a process of free
debate and discussion. As we argue in [section
A.2.11](secA2.html#seca211), such collective decision making is
compatible with anarchist principles - indeed, is based on them. By
governing ourselves directly, we exclude others governing us. However,
we do not make a fetish of this, recognising that, in certain
circumstances, the minority must and should ignore majority decisions.
For example, if the majority of an organisation decide on a policy which
the minority thinks is disastrous then why should they follow the
majority? Equally, if the majority make a decision which harms the
liberty and equality of a non-oppressive and non-exploitative minority,
then that minority has the right to reject the "authority" of the
majority. Hence Carole Pateman:

> *"The essence of liberal social contract theory is that individuals
> ought to promise to, or enter an agreement to, obey representatives,
> to whom they have alienated their right to make political decisions .
> . . Promising . . . is an expression of individual freedom and
> equality, yet commits individuals for the future. Promising also
> implies that individuals are capable of independent judgement and
> rational deliberation, and of evaluating and changing their own
> actions and relationships; promises may sometimes justifiably be
> broken. However, to promise to obey is to deny or limit, to a greater

> certain areas, the person making the promise is no longer free to
> exercise her capacities and decide upon her own actions, and is no
> longer equal, but subordinate."* [**The Problem of Political
> Obligation**, p. 19]

Thus, for anarchists, a democracy which does not involve individual
rights to dissent, to disagree and to practice civil disobedience would
violate freedom and equality, the very values Marxists usually claim to
be at the heart of their politics. The claim that anarchism is
*"anti-democratic"* basically hides the argument that the minority must
become the slave of the majority - with no right of dissent when the
majority is wrong (in practice, of course, it is usually meant the
orders and laws of the minority who are elected to power). In effect, it
wishes the minority to be subordinate, not equal, to the majority.
Anarchists, in contrast, because we support self-management also
recognise the importance of dissent and individuality - in essence,
because we are in favour of self-management ("democracy" does not do the
concept justice) we also favour the individual freedom that is its
rationale. We support the liberty of individuals because we believe in
self-management ("democracy") so passionately.

So Howl and Draper fail to understand the rationale for democratic
decision making - it is not based on the idea that the majority is
always right but that individual freedom requires democracy to express
and defend itself. By placing the collective above the individual, they
undermine democratic values and replace them with little more than
tyranny by the majority (or, more likely, a tiny minority who claim to
represent the majority).

Moreover, progress is determined by those who dissent and rebel against
the status quo and the decisions of the majority. That is why anarchists
support the right of dissent in self-managed groups - in fact, dissent,
refusal, revolt by individuals and minorities is a key aspect of
self-management. Given that Leninists do not support self-management
(rather they, at best, support the Lockean notion of electing a
government as being "democracy") it is hardly surprising they, like
Locke, view dissent as a danger and something to denounce. Anarchists,
on the other hand, recognising that self-management's (i.e. direct
democracy's) rationale and base is in individual freedom, recognise and
support the rights of individuals to rebel against what they consider as
unjust impositions. As history shows, the anarchist position is the
correct one - without rebellion, numerous minorities would never have
improved their position and society would stagnate. Indeed, Howl's and
Draper's comments are just a reflection of the standard capitalist
diatribe against strikers and protestors - they do not need to protest,
for they live in a "democracy."

This Marxist notion that anarchists are "anti-democratic" gets them into
massive contradictions. Lance Selfa's highly inaccurate and misleading
article *"Emma Goldman: A life of controversy"* is an example of this
[**International Socialist Review**, no. 34, March-April 2004] Ignoring
the far more substantial evidence for Leninist elitism, Selfa asserted
that *"Goldman never turned away from the idea that heroic individuals,
not masses, make history"* and quotes from her 1910 essay *"Minorities
Versus Majorities"* to prove this. Significantly, he does not actually
refute the arguments Goldman expounded. He does, needless to say,
misrepresent them.

The aim of Goldman's essay was to state the obvious - that the mass is
not the source for new ideas. Rather, new, progressive, ideas are the
product of minorities and which then spread to the majority by the
actions of those minorities. Even social movements and revolutions start
when a minority takes action. Trade unionism, for example, was (and
still is) a minority movement in most countries. Support for racial and
sexual equality was long despised (or, at best, ignored) by the majority
and it took a resolute minority to advance that cause and spread the
idea in the majority. The Russian Revolution did not start with the
majority. It started when a minority of women workers (ignoring the
advice of the local Bolsheviks) took to the streets and from these
hundreds grew into a movement of hundreds of thousands.

The facts are clearly on the side of Goldman, not Selfa. Given that
Goldman was expounding such an obvious law of social evolution, it seems
incredulous that Selfa has a problem with it. This is particularly the
case as Marxism (particularly its Leninist version) implicitly
recognises this. As Marx argued, the ruling ideas of any epoch are those
of the ruling class. Likewise for Goldman: *"Human thought has always
been falsified by tradition and custom, and perverted false education in
the interests of those who held power . . . by the State and the ruling
class."* Hence the *"continuous struggle"* against *"the State and even
against 'society,' that is, against the majority subdued and hypnotised
by the State and State worship."* If this were not the case, as Goldman
noted, no state could save itself or private property from the masses.
Hence the need for people to break from their conditioning, to act for
themselves. As she argued, such direct action is *"the salvation of
man"* as it *"necessitates integrity, self-reliance, and courage."*
[**Red Emma Speaks**, p. 111 and p. 76]

Thus Goldman, like other anarchists, was not dismissing the masses, just
stressing the obvious: namely that socialism is a process of
self-liberation and the task of the conscious minority is to encourage
this process by encouraging the direct action of the masses. Hence
Goldman's support for syndicalism and direct action, a support Selfa
(significantly) fails to inform his readers of.

So was Goldman's rejection of "majorities" the elitism Selfa claims it
was? No, far from it. This is clear from looking at that work in
context. For example, in a debate between her and a socialist she used
the Lawrence strike *"as an example of direct action."* [**Living My
Life**, vol. 1., p. 491] The workers in one of the mills started the
strike by walking out. The next day five thousand at another mill struck
and marched to another mill and soon doubled their number. The strikers
soon had to supply food and fuel for 50,000. [Howard Zinn, **A People's
History of the United States**, pp. 327-8] Rather than the strike being
the act of the majority, it was the direct action of a minority which
started it and it then spread to the majority (a strike, incidentally,
Goldman supported and fund raised for). It should also be noted that the
Lawrence strike reflected her ideas of how a general strike could be
started by *"one industry or by a small, conscious minority among the
workers"* which *"is soon taken up by many other industries, spreading
like wildfire."* [**Red Emma Speaks**, p. 95]

Do Marxists really argue that this was "elitist"? If so, then every
spontaneous revolt is "elitist". Every attempt by oppressed minorities
to resist their oppression is "elitist." Indeed, every attempt to change
society is "elitist" as if it involves a minority not limiting
themselves to simply advancing new ideas but, instead, taking direct
action to raise awareness or to resist hierarchy in the here and now.
Revolutions occur when the ideas of the majority catch up with the
minority who inspire others with their ideas and activity. So in his
keenness to label the anarchist movement "elitist", Selfa has also,
logically, so-labelled the labour, feminist, peace and civil rights
movements (among many others).

Equally embarrassing for Selfa, Trotsky (a person whom he contrasts
favourably with Goldman despite the fact he was a practitioner and
advocate of party dictatorship) agreed with the anarchists on the
importance of minorities. As he put it during the debate on Kronstadt in
the late 1930s, a *"revolution is 'made' directly by a **minority**. The
success of a revolution is possible, however, only where this minority
finds more or less support, or at least friendly neutrality, on the part
of the majority. The shift in different stages of the revolution . . .
is directly determined by changing political relations between the
minority and the majority, between the vanguard and the class."* [Lenin
and Trotsky, **Kronstadt**, p. 85] Not that this makes Trotsky an
elitist for Selfa, of course. The key difference is that Goldman did not
argue that this minority should seize power and rule the masses,
regardless of the wishes of that majority, as Trotsky did (see [section
H.1.2](secH1.html#sech12)). As Goldman noted, the *"Socialist demagogues
know that [her argument is true] as well as I, but they maintain the
myth of the virtues of the majority, because their very scheme means the
perpetuation of power"* and *"authority, coercion and dependence rest on
the mass, but never freedom."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 85]

So, yes, anarchists do support individual freedom to resist even
democratically made decisions simply because democracy **has to be**
based on individual liberty. Without the right of dissent, democracy
becomes a joke and little more than a numerical justification for
tyranny. This does not mean we are *"anti-democratic,"* indeed the
reverse as we hold true to the fundamental rationale for democratic
decision-making - it allows individuals to combine as equals and not as
subordinates and masters. Moreover, diversity is essential for any
viable eco-system and it is essential in any viable society (and, of
course, any society worth living in). This means that a healthy society
is one which encourages diversity, individuality, dissent and, equally,
self-managed associations to ensure the freedom of all. As Malatesta
argued:

> *"There are matters over which it is worth accepting the will of the
> majority because the damage caused by a split would be greater than
> that caused by error; there are circumstances in which discipline
> becomes a duty because to fail in it would be to fail in the
> solidarity between the oppressed and would mean betrayal in face of
> the enemy. But when one is convinced that the organisation is pursuing
> a course which threatens the future and makes it difficult to remedy
> the harm done, then it is a duty to rebel and to resist even at the

> conviction that fraternal co-operation is necessary to fight
> oppression and to achieve a society in which everyone will be able to
> enjoy his [or her] own life."* [**Errico Malatesta: His Life and
> Ideas**, pp. 132-3]

This means that anarchists are not against majority decision making as
such. We simply recognise it has limitations. In practice, the need for
majority and minority to come to an agreement is one most anarchists
would recognise:

> "But such an adaptation [of the minority to the decisions of the
> majority] on the one hand by one group must be reciprocal, voluntary
> and must stem from an awareness of need and of goodwill to prevent the
> running of social affairs from being paralysed by obstinacy. It cannot
> be imposed as a principle and statutory norm. . .
> "So . . . anarchists deny the right of the majority to govern in human
> society in general . . . how is it possible . . . to declare that
> anarchists should submit to the decisions of the majority before they
> have even heard what those might be?" [Malatesta, **The Anarchist
> Revolution**, pp. 100-1]

Therefore, while accepting majority decision making as a key aspect of a
revolutionary movement and a free society, anarchists do not make a
fetish of it. We recognise that we must use our own judgement in
evaluating each decision reached simply because the majority is not
always right. We must balance the need for solidarity in the common
struggle and needs of common life with critical analysis and judgement.
As Malatesta argued:

> "In any case it is not a question of being right or wrong; it is a
> question of freedom, freedom for all, freedom for each individual so
> long as he [or she] does not violate the equal freedom of others. No

> His Life and Ideas**, p. 72]

Needless to say, our arguments apply with even more force to the
decisions of the **representatives** of the majority, who are in
practice a very small minority. Leninists usually try and confuse these
two distinct forms of decision making. When Leninists discuss majority
decision making they almost always mean the decisions of those elected
by the majority - the central committee or the government - rather than
the majority of the masses or an organisation. Ultimately, the Leninist
support for democracy (as the Russian Revolution showed) is conditional
on whether the majority supports them or not. Anarchists are not as
hypocritical or as elitist as this, arguing that everyone should have
the same rights the Leninists usurp for their leaders.

This counterpoising of socialism to "individualism" is significant. The
aim of socialism is, after all, to increase individual liberty (to quote
the **Communist Manifesto**, to create *"an association, in which the
free development of each is the condition for the free development of
all."* [**The Marx-Engels Reader**, p. 491]). As such, authentic
socialism **is** "individualist" in its aspirations and denounces
capitalism for being a partial and flawed individualism which benefits
the few at the expense of the many (in terms of their development and
individuality). This can be seen when Goldman, for example, argued that
anarchism *"alone stresses the importance of the individual, his [or
her] possibilities and needs in a free society."* It *"insists that the
centre of gravity in society is the individual - that he must think for
himself, act freely, and live fully. The aim of Anarchism is that every
individual in the world shall be able to do so."* Needless to say, she
differentiated her position from bourgeois ideology: *"Of course, this
has nothing in common with a much boasted 'rugged individualism.' Such
predatory individualism is really flabby, not rugged . . . Their 'rugged
individualism' is simply one of the many pretences the ruling class
makes to unbridled business and political extortion."* [**Op. Cit.**, p.
442 and p. 443] This support for individuality did not preclude
solidarity, organising unions, practising direct action, supporting
syndicalism, desiring communism and so on, but rather **required** it
(as Goldman's own life showed). It flows automatically from a love of
freedom for all. Given this, the typical Leninist attacks against
anarchism for being "individualism" simply exposes the state capitalist
nature of Bolshevism:

> *"capitalism promotes egotism, not individuality or 'individualism.' .
> . . the ego it created . . . [is] shrivelled . . . The term 'bourgeois
> individualism,' an epithet widely used by the left today against
> libertarian elements, reflects the extent to which bourgeois ideology
> permeates the socialist project; indeed, the extent to which the
> 'socialist' project (as distinguished from the libertarian communist
> project) is a mode of state capitalism."* [Murray Bookchin,
> **Post-Scarcity Anarchism**, p. 194fn]

Therefore the Marxist attack on anarchism as *"anti-democratic"* is not
only false, it is ironic and hypocritical. Firstly, anarchists do
**not** argue for *"the absolute sovereignty of the individual ego."*
Rather, we argue for individual freedom. This, in turn, implies a
commitment to self-managed forms of social organisation. This means that
anarchists do not confuse agreement with (hierarchical) authority.
Secondly, Marxists do not explain why the majority is always right or
why their opinions are automatically the truth. Thirdly, the logical
conclusions of their arguments would result in the absolute enserfment
of the individual to the representatives of the majority. Fourthly,
rather than being supporters of democracy, Marxists like Lenin and
Trotsky explicitly argued for minority rule and the ignoring of majority
decisions when they clashed with the decisions of the ruling party.
Fifthly, their support for "democratic" centralised power means, in
practice, the elimination of democracy in the grassroots. As can be seen
from Trotsky's arguments against the Makhnovists, the democratic
organisation and decisions of millions can be banned by a single
individual.

All in all, Marxists claims that anarchists are *"anti-democratic"* just
backfire on Marxism.

H.2.12 Does anarchism survive only in the absence of a strong workers' movement?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Derek Howl argues that anarchism *"survives only in the absence of a
strong workers movement"* and is the politics of *"non-proletarians."*
As he puts it, there *"is a class basis to this. Just as Proudhon's
'anarchism' reflected the petty bourgeoisie under pressure, so too
Bakuninism as a movement rested upon non-proletarians . . . In Italy
Bakuninism was based upon the large 'lumpen bourgeoisie', doomed petty
bourgeois layers. In Switzerland the Jura Federation . . . was composed
of a world of cottage industry stranded between the old world and the
new, as were pockets of newly proletarianised peasants that
characterised anarchism in Spain."* He approvingly quotes Hal Draper
assertion that anarchism *"was an ideology alien to the life of modern
working people."* [*"The Legacy of Hal Draper,"* pp. 137-49,
**International Socialism**, no. 52, p. 148]

Ignoring the obvious contradiction of *"newly proletarianised peasants"*
being *"non-proletarians,"* we have the standard Marxist *"class
analysis"* of anarchism. This is to assert that anarchism is
*"non-proletarian"* while Marxism is *"proletarian."* On the face of it,
such an assertion seems to fly in the face of historical facts. After
all, when Marx and Engels were writing the **Communist Manifesto**, the
proletariat was a tiny minority of the population of a mostly rural,
barely industrialised Germany. Perhaps it was Engels' experiences as a
capitalist in England that allowed him an insight into *"the life of
modern working people?"* It should also be noted that neither Howel or
Draper is being original, they are simply repeating Marx's assertion
that anarchism *"continues to exist only where there is as yet no proper
workers' movement. This is a fact."* [**Collected Works**, vol. 24, p.
247]

Beyond this there are a few problems with this type of argument.
Firstly, there are the factual problems. Simply put, anarchism appealed
to *"modern"* working people and Marxism has appealed to the
*"non-proletarian"* groups and individuals (and vice versa, of course).
This can be seen from the examples Howl lists as well as the rise of
syndicalist ideas after the reformism of the first Marxist movement
(social democracy) became apparent. In fact, the rise of Marxism within
the labour movement is associated with its descent into reformism,
**not** revolution. Secondly, there is the slight ideological problem
that Lenin himself argued that the working class, by its own efforts,
did not produce socialist ideas which were generated far from *"the life
of modern working people"* by the intelligentsia. Lastly, there is the
assumption that two long dead Germans, living in an environment where
*"modern working people"* (proletarians) were a small minority of the
working population, could really determine for all time what is (and is
not) *"proletarian"* politics.

Taking the countries Howl lists, we can see that any claim that
anarchism is *"alien"* to the working class is simply false. Looking at
each one, it is clearly the case that, for Marxists, the **politics** of
the people involved signify their working class credentials, **not**
their actual economic or social class. Thus we have the sociological
absurdity that makes anarchist workers *"petty bourgeois"* while actual
members of the bourgeoisie (like Engels) or professional revolutionaries
(and the sons of middle class families like Marx, Lenin and Trotsky) are
considered as representatives of *"proletarian"* politics. Indeed, when
these radical members of the middle-class repress working class people
(as did Lenin and Trotsky were in power) they **remain** figures to be
followed and their acts justified in terms of the "objective" needs of
the working people they are oppressing! Ultimately, for most Marxists,
whether someone is *"non-proletariat"* depends on their ideological
viewpoint and not, in fact, their actual class.

Hence we discover Marx and Engels (like their followers) blaming
Bakunin's success in the International, as one historian notes, *"on the
middle-class leadership of Italy's socialist movement and the
backwardness of the country. But if middle-class leaders were the
catalysts of proletarian revolutionary efforts in Italy, this was also
true of every other country in Europe, not excluding the General Council
in London."* [T.R. Ravindranathan, **Bakunin and the Italians**, p. 168]
And by interpreting the difficulties for Marxism in this way, Marx and
Engels (like their followers) need not question their own ideas and
assumptions. As Nunzio Pernicone notes, *"[f]rom the outset, Engels had
consistently underestimated Bakunin as a political adversary and refused
to believe that Italian workers might embrace anarchist doctrines."*
However, *"even a casual perusal of the internationalist and dissident
democratic press would have revealed to Engels that Bakuninism was
rapidly developing a following among Italian artisans and workers. But
this reality flew in the face of his unshakeable belief that Italian
internationalists were all a 'gang of declasses, the refuse of the
bourgeoisie.'"* Even after the rise of the Italian Marxism in the 1890s,
*"the anarchist movement was proportionately more working-class than the
PSI"* and the *"the number of bourgeois intellectuals and professionals
that supported the PSI [Italian Socialist Party] was vastly greater"*
than those supporting anarchism. Indeed, *"the percentage of party
membership derived from the bourgeoisie was significantly higher in the
PSI than among the anarchists."* [**Italian Anarchism, 1864-1892**, p.
82 and p. 282] Ironically, given Engels diatribes against the Italian
anarchists stopping workers following *"proletarian"* (i.e. Marxist)
politics and standing for elections, *"as the PSI grew more
working-class, just before the outbreak of war [in 1914], its
Directorate [elected by the party congress] grew more
anti-parliamentary."* [Gwyn A. Williams, **Proletarian Order**, p. 29]

As we noted in [section A.5.5](secA5.html#seca55), the role of the
anarchists and syndicalists compared to the Marxists during the 1920
near revolution suggested that the real *"proletarian"* revolutionaries
were, in fact, the former and **not** the latter. All in all, the
history of the Italian labour movement clearly show that, for most
Marxists, whether a group represents the *"proletariat"* is simply
dependent on their ideological commitment, **not** their actual class.

As regards the Jura Federation, we discover that its support was wider
than suggested. As Marxist Paul Thomas noted, *"Bakunin's initial
support in Switzerland - like Marx's in England - came from resident
aliens, political refugees . . . but he also gathered support among
**Gastarbeitier** for whom Geneva was already a centre, where builders,
carpenters and workers in heavy industry tended to be French or Italian
. . . Bakunin . . . also marshalled considerable support among French
speaking domestic workers and watchmakers in the Jura."* [**Karl Marx
and the Anarchists**, p. 390] It would be interesting to hear a Marxist
claim that *"heavy industry"* represented the past or
*"non-proletarian"* elements! Similarly, E. H. Carr in his (hostile)
biography of Bakunin, noted that the *"sections of the International at
Geneva fell into two groups."* Skilled craftsmen formed the *"Right
wing"* while *"the builders, carpenters, and workers in the heavier
trades, the majority of whom were immigrants from France and Italy,
represented the Left."* Unsurprisingly, these different groups of
workers had different politics. The craftsmen *"concentrated on . . .
reform"* while the others *"nourished hopes of a complete social
upheaval."* Bakunin, as would be expected, *"fanned the spirit of
revolt"* among these, the proletarian workers and soon had a
*"commanding position in the Geneva International."* [**Michael
Bakunin**, p. 361] It should be noted that Marx and the General Council
of the International consistently supported the reformist wing of the
International in Geneva which organised political alliances with the
middle-class liberals during elections. Given these facts, it is little
wonder that Howl concentrates on the support Bakunin received from
domestic workers producing watches. To mention the support for Bakunin
by organised, obviously proletarian, workers would undermine his case
and so it is ignored.

Lastly, there is Spain. It seems funny that a Marxist would use Spain as
an example **against** the class roots of anarchism. After all, that is
one of the countries where anarchism dominated the working class
movement. As one historian points out, *"it was not until the 1860s -
when anarchism was introduced - that a substantive working class
movement began to emerge"* and *"throughout the history of Spanish
anarchism, its survival depended in large measure on the anarchists'
ability to maintain direct links with the workers."* [George R.
Esenwein, **Anarchist Ideology and the Working-Class Movement in Spain,
1868-1898**, p. 6 and p. 207] As well as organising *"newly
proletarianised peasants,"* the "Bakuninists" also organised industrial
workers - indeed, far more successfully than the Socialists. Ironically,
the UGT only started to approach the size of the CNT once it had started
to organise *"newly proletarianised peasants"* in the 1930s (i.e.,
anarchist unions organised more of the industrial working class than the
Socialist ones). From such a fact, we wonder if Marxists would argue
that socialism rested on *"non-proletarian"* elements?

Moreover, the logic of dismissing anarchism as *"non-proletarian"*
because it organised *"newly proletarianised peasants"* is simply
laughable. After all, capitalism needed landless labours in order to
start. This meant that the first proletarians lived in rural areas and
were made up of ex-peasants. When these ex-peasants arrived in the towns
and cities, they were still *"newly proletarianised peasants."* To
ignore these groups of workers would mean potentially harming the labour
movement. And, of course, a large section of Bolshevik support in 1917
was to be found in *"newly proletarianised peasants"* whether in the
army or working in the factories. Ironically enough, the Mensheviks
argued that the Bolsheviks gained their influence from worker-peasant
industrial *"raw recruits"* and not from the genuine working class.
[Orlando Figes, **A People's Tragedy**, p. 830] As such, to dismiss
anarchism because it gained converts from similar social strata as the
Bolsheviks seems, on the face of it, a joke.

As can be seen Howl's attempts to subject anarchism to a *"class
analysis"* simply fails. He selects the evidence which fits his theory
and ignores that which does not. However, looking at the very examples
he bases his case on shows how nonsensical it is. Simply put, anarchist
ideas appealed to many types of workers, including typically
*"proletarian"* ones who worked in large-scale industries. What they
seem to have in common is a desire for radical social change, organised
by themselves in their own combative class organs (such as unions).
Moreover, like the early British workers movement, they considered these
unions, as well as being organs of class struggle, could also be the
framework of a free socialist society. Such a perspective is hardly
backward (indeed, since 1917 most Marxists pay lip-service to this
vision!).

Which brings us to the next major problem with Howl's argument, namely
the fate of Marxism and the *"strong"* labour movement it allegedly is
suited for. Looking at the only nation which did have a *"modern"*
working class during the most of Marx's life, Britain, the *"strong"*
labour movement it produced was (and has) not been anarchist, it is
true, but neither was it (nor did it become) Marxist. Rather, it has
been a mishmash of conflicting ideas, predominately reformist state
socialist ones which owe little, if anything, to Marx. Indeed, the
closest Britain came to developing a wide scale revolutionary working
class movement was during the *"syndicalist revolt"* of the 1910s.
Ironically, some Marxists joined this movement simply because the
existing Marxist parties were so reformist or irrelevant to the *"life
of modern working people."*

Looking at other countries, we find the same process. The rise of social
democracy (Marxism) in the international labour movement simply
signified the rise of reformism. Instead of producing a
**revolutionary** labour movement, Marxism helped produce the opposite
(although, initially, hiding reformist activity behind revolutionary
rhetoric). So when Howl asserts that anarchism *"survives in the absence
of a strong workers' movement,"* we have to wonder what planet he is on.

Thus, to state matters more correctly, anarchism flourishes during those
periods when the labour movement and its members are radical, taking
direct action and creating new forms of organisation which are still
based on workers' self-management. This is to be expected as anarchism
is both based upon and is the result of workers' self-liberation through
struggle. In less militant times, the effects of bourgeois society and
the role of unions within the capitalist economy can de-radicalise the
labour movement and lead to the rise of bureaucracy within it. It is
then, during periods when the class struggle is low, that reformist
ideas spread. Sadly, Marxism aided that spread by its tactics - the role
of electioneering focused struggle away from direct action and into the
ballot-box and so onto leaders rather than working class self-activity.

Moreover, if we look at the current state of the labour movement, then
we would have to conclude that Marxism is *"an ideology alien to the
life of modern working people."* Where are the large Marxist working
class unions and parties? There are a few large reformist socialist and
Stalinist parties in continental Europe, but these are not Marxist in
any meaningful sense of the word. Most of the socialist ones used to be
Marxist, although they relatively quickly stopped being revolutionary in
any meaningful sense of the word a very long time ago (some, like the
German Social Democrats, organised counter-revolutionary forces to crush
working class revolt after the First World War). As for the Stalinist
parties, it would be better to consider it a sign of shame that they get
any support in the working class at all. In terms of revolutionary
Marxists, there are various Trotskyist sects arguing amongst themselves
on who is the **real** vanguard of the proletariat, but **no** Marxist
labour movement.

Which, of course, brings us to the next point, namely the ideological
problems for Leninists themselves by such an assertion. After all, Lenin
himself argued that *"the life of modern working people"* could only
produce *"trade-union consciousness."* According to him, socialist ideas
were developed independently of working people by the socialist
(middle-class) *"intelligentsia."* As we discuss in [section
H.5.1](secH5.html#sech51), for Lenin, socialism was an ideology which
was alien to the life of modern working class people.

Lastly, there is the question of whether Marx and Engels can seriously
be thought of as being able to decree once and for all what is and is
not *"proletarian"* politics. Given that neither of these men were
working class (one was a capitalist!) it makes the claim that they would
know *"proletarian"* politics suspect. Moreover, they formulated their
ideas of what constitute *"proletarian"* politics before a modern
working class actually developed in any country bar Britain. This means,
that from the experience of **one** section of the proletariat in
**one** country in the 1840s, Marx and Engels have decreed for all time
what is and is not a *"proletarian"* set of politics! On the face of it,
it is hardly a convincing argument, particularly as we have over 150
years of experience of these tactics with which to evaluate them!

Based on this perspective, Marx and Engels opposed all other socialist
groups as *"sects"* if they did not subscribe to their ideas.
Ironically, while arguing that all other socialists were fostering their
sectarian politics onto the workers movement, they themselves fostered
their own perspective onto it. Originally, because the various sections
of the International worked under different circumstances and had
attained different degrees of development, the theoretical ideals which
reflected the real movement also diverged. The International, therefore,
was open to all socialist and working class tendencies and its general
policies would be, by necessity, based on conference decisions that
reflected this divergence. These decisions would be determined by free
discussion within and between sections of all economic, social and
political ideas. Marx, however, replaced this policy with a common
program of *"political action"* (i.e. electioneering) by mass political
parties via the fixed Hague conference of 1872. Rather than having this
position agreed by the normal exchange of ideas and theoretical
discussion in the sections guided by the needs of the practical
struggle, Marx imposed what **he** considered as the future of the
workers movement onto the International - and denounced those who
disagreed with him as sectarians. The notion that what Marx considered
as necessary might be another sectarian position imposed on the workers'
movement did not enter his head nor those of his followers:

> *"Marx had indeed insisted, in the earlier years of the First
> International, on the need for building on actual movements rather
> than constructing a dogma which movements were then required to fit.
> But when the actual movements took forms which he disliked, as they
> largely did in Spain and Italy, in Germany under Lassalle's influence,
> and in Great Britain as soon as the Trade Unions' most immediate
> demands had been met, he was apt to forget his own precepts and to
> become the grand inquisitor into heretical misdeeds."* [G.D.H. Cole,
> **A History of Socialist Thought**, vol. 2, p. 256]

That support for *"political action"* was just as "sectarian" as support
for non-participation in elections can be seen from Engels 1895 comment
that *"[t]here had long been universal suffrage in France, but it had
fallen into disrepute through the misuse to which the Bonapartist
government had put it . . . It also existed in Spain since the republic,
but in Spain boycott of elections was ever the rule of all serious
opposition parties . . . The revolutionary workers of the Latin
countries had been wont to regard the suffrage as a snare, as an
instrument of government trickery."* [**Marx-Engels Reader**, p. 565]
Needless to say, he had failed to mention those little facts when he was
attacking anarchists for expressing the opinions of the *"revolutionary
workers of the Latin countries"* and *"all serious opposition parties"*
in the 1870s! Similarly, the Haymarket Martyrs had moved from a Marxist
position on elections to an anarchist one after their own experiences
using the ballot box, as did the many British socialists who became
syndicalists in the early years of the 20th century. It seems strange to
conclude that these positions are not expressions of working class
struggle while that of Marx and Engels are, particularly given the
terrible results of that strategy!

Thus the Marxist claim that true working class movements are based on
mass political parties based on hierarchical, centralised, leadership
and those who reject this model and political action (electioneering)
are sects and sectarians is simply their option and little more. Once we
look at the workers' movement without the blinkers created by Marxism,
we see that Anarchism was a movement of working class people using what
they considered valid tactics to meet their own social, economic and
political goals - tactics and goals which evolved to meet changing
circumstances. Seeing the rise of anarchism and syndicalism as the
political expression of the class struggle, guided by the needs of the
practical struggle they faced naturally follows when we recognise the
Marxist model for what it is - just one possible interpretation of the
future of the workers' movement rather than **the** future of that
movement (and as the history of Social Democracy indicates, the
predictions of Bakunin and the anarchists within the First International
were proved correct).

This tendency to squeeze the revolutionary workers' movement into the
forms decreed by two people in the mid-nineteenth century has proved to
be disastrous for it. Even after the total failure of social democracy,
the idea of *"revolutionary"* parliamentarianism was fostered onto the
Third International by the Bolsheviks in spite of the fact that more and
more revolutionary workers in advanced capitalist nations were rejecting
it in favour of direct action and autonomous working class
self-organisation. Anarchists and libertarian Marxists based themselves
on this actual movement of working people, influenced by the failure of
*"political action,"* while the Bolsheviks based themselves on the works
of Marx and Engels and their own experiences in a backward, semi-feudal
society whose workers had already created factory committees and soviets
by direct action. It was for this reason that the anarcho-syndicalist
Augustin Souchy said he referred *"to the tendencies that exist in the
modern workers' movement"* when he argued at the Second Congress of the
Communist International:

> *"It must be granted that among revolutionary workers the tendency
> toward parliamentarism is disappearing more and more. On the contrary,
> a strong anti-parliamentary tendency is becoming apparent in the ranks
> of the most advanced part of the proletariat. Look at the Shop
> Stewards' movement [in Britain] or Spanish syndicalism . . . The IWW
> is absolutely antiparliamentary . . . I want to point out that the
> idea of antiparliamentarism is asserting itself more strongly in
> Germany . . . as a result of the revolution itself . . . We must view
> the question in this light."* [**Proceedings and Documents of the
> Second Congress 1920**, vol. 1, pp. 176-7]

Of course, this perspective of basing yourself on the ideas and tactics
generated by the class struggle was rejected in favour of a return to
the principles of Marx and Engels and their vision of what constituted a
genuine *"proletarian"* movement. If these tactics were the correct
ones, then why did they not lead to a less dismal set of results? After
all, the degeneration of social democracy into reformism would suggest
their failure and sticking *"revolutionary"* before their tactics (as in
*"revolutionary parliamentarianism"*) changes little. Marxists, like
anarchists, are meant to be materialists, not idealists. What was the
actual outcome of the Leninist strategies? Did they result in successful
proletarian revolutions. No, they did not. The revolutionary wave peaked
and fell and the Leninist parties themselves very easily and quickly
became Stalinised. Significantly, those areas with a large anarchist,
syndicalist or quasi-syndicalist (e.g. the council communists) workers
movements (Italy, Spain and certain parts of Germany) came closest to
revolution and by the mid-1930s, only Spain with its strong anarchist
movement had a revolutionary labour movement. Therefore, rather than
representing *"non-proletarian"* or *"sectarian"* politics forced upon
the working class, anarchism reflected the politics required to built a
**revolutionary** workers' movement rather than a reformist mass party.

As such, perhaps we can finally lay to rest the idea that Marx predicted
the whole future of the labour movement and the path it must take like
some kind of socialist Nostradamus. Equally, we can dismiss Marxist
claims of the *"non-proletarian"* nature of anarchism as uninformed and
little more than an attempt to squeeze history into an ideological
prison. As noted above, in order to present such an analysis, the actual
class compositions of significant events and social movements have to be
manipulated. This is the case of the Paris Commune, for example, which
was predominantly a product of artisans (i.e. the *"petit
bourgeoisie"*), **not** the industrial working class and yet claimed by
Marxists as an example of the *"dictatorship of the proletariat."*
Ironically, many of the elements of the Commune praised by Marx can be
found in the works of Proudhon and Bakunin which pre-date the uprising.
Similarly, the idea that workers' fighting organisations ("soviets")
would be the means to abolish the state and the framework of a socialist
society can be found in Bakunin's works, decades before Lenin paid
lip-service to this idea in 1917. For a theory allegedly resting on
*"non-proletarian"* elements anarchism has successfully predicted many
of the ideas Marxists claim to have learnt from proletarian class
struggle!

So, in summary, the claims that anarchism is *"alien"* to working class
life, that it is *"non-proletarian"* or *"survives in the absence of a
strong workers' movement"* are simply false. Looking objectively at the
facts of the matter quickly shows that this is the case.

H.2.13 Do anarchists reject *"political"* struggles and action?
---------------------------------------------------------------

A common Marxist claim is that anarchists and syndicalists ignore or
dismiss the importance of *"political"* struggles or action. This is not
true. Rather, as we discuss in [section J.2.10](secJ2.html#secj210), we
think that *"political"* struggles should be conducted by the same means
as social and economic struggles, namely by direct action, solidarity
and working class self-organisation.

As this is a common assertion, it is useful to provide a quick summary
of why anarchists do not, in fact, reject *"political"* struggles and
action as such. Rather, to quote Bakunin, anarchism *"does not reject
politics generally. It will certainly be forced to involve itself
insofar as it will be forced to struggle against the bourgeois class. It
only rejects bourgeois politics"* as it *"establishes the predatory
domination of the bourgeoisie."* [**The Political Philosophy of
Bakunin**, p. 313] For Kropotkin, it was a truism that it was
*"absolutely impossible . . . to confine the ideas of the working mass
within the narrow circle of reductions in working hours and wage
increases . . . The social question compels attention."* This fact
implied two responses: *"the workers' organisation propels itself either
into the sterile path of parliamentary politics as in Germany, or into
the path of revolution."* [quoted by Caroline Cahm, **Kropotkin and the
rise of Revolutionary Anarchism, 1872-1886**, p. 241]

So while Marxists often argue that anarchists are exclusively interested
in economic struggle and reject *"politics"* or *"political action,"*
the truth of the matter is different. We are well aware of the
importance of political issues, although anarchists reject using
bourgeois methods in favour of direct action. Moreover, we are aware
that any social or economic struggle has its political aspects and that
such struggles bring the role of the state as defender of capitalism and
the need to struggle against it into focus:

> *"There is no serious strike that occurs today without the appearance
> of troops, the exchange of blows and some acts of revolt. Here they
> fight with the troops; there they march on the factories; . . . in
> Pittsburgh in the United States, the strikers found themselves masters
> of a territory as large as France, and the strike became the signal
> for a general revolt against the State; in Ireland the peasants on
> strike found themselves in open revolt against the State. Thanks to
> government intervention the rebel against the factory becomes the
> rebel against the State."* [Kropotkin, quoted by Caroline Cahm, **Op.
> Cit.**, p. 256]

As Malatesta argued, from *"the economic struggle one must pass to the
political struggle, that is to struggle against government; and instead
of opposing the capitalist millions with the workers' few pennies
scraped together with difficulty, one must oppose the rifles and guns
which defend property with the more effective means that the people will
be able to defeat force by force."* [**Errico Malatesta: His Life and
Ideas**, pp. 193-4]

This means that the question of whether to conduct political struggles
is **not** the one which divides anarchists from Marxists. Rather, it is
a question of **how** this struggle is fought. For anarchists, this
struggle is best fought using **direct action** (see [section
J.2](secJ2.html)) and fighting working class organisations based in our
workplaces and communities. For Marxists, the political struggle is seen
as being based on standing candidates in bourgeois elections. This can
be seen from the resolution passed by the socialist ("Second")
International in 1893. This resolution was designed to exclude
anarchists and stated that only *"those Socialist Parties and
Organisations which recognise the organisation of workers and of
political action"* could join the International. By *"political action"*
it meant *"that the working-class organisations seek, in as far as
possible, to use or conquer political rights and the machinery of
legislation for the furthering of the interests of the proletariat and
the conquest of political power."* [quoted by Susan Milner, **The
Dilemmas of Internationalism**, p. 49] Significantly, while this
International and its member parties (particular the German Social
Democrats) were happy to expel anarchists, they never expelled the
leading reformists from their ranks.

So, in general, anarchists use the word *"political action"* to refer
exclusively to the taking part of revolutionaries in bourgeois elections
(i.e. electioneering or parliamentarianism). It does not mean a
rejection of fighting for political reforms or a lack of interest in
political issues, quite the reverse in fact. The reason **why**
anarchists reject this tactic is discussed in [section
J.2.6](secJ2.html#secj26)).

For Kropotkin, the idea that you could somehow "prepare" for a
revolution by electioneering was simply a joke. *"As if the
bourgeoisie,"* he argued, *"still holding on to its capital, could allow
them [the socialists] to experiment with socialism even if they
succeeded in gaining control of power! As if the conquest of the
municipalities were possible without the conquest of the factories."* He
saw that *"those who yesterday were considered socialists are today
letting go of socialism, by renouncing its mother idea ["the need to
replace the wage system and to abolish individual ownership of . . .
social capital"] and passing over into the camp of the bourgeoisie,
while retaining, so as to hide their turnabout, the label of
socialism."* [**Words of a Rebel**, p. 181 and p. 180] The differences
in results between direct action and electioneering were obvious:

> *"However moderate the war cry - provided it is in the domain of
> relations between capital and labour - as soon as it proceeds to put
> it into practice by revolutionary methods, it ends by increasing it
> and will be led to demand the overthrow of the regime of property. On
> the other hand a party which confines itself to parliamentary politics
> ends up abandoning its programme, however advanced it may have been at
> the beginning."* [Kropotkin, quoted by Cahm, **Op. Cit.**, p. 252]

Ultimately, the bourgeois tactics used ended up with bourgeois results.
As Emma Goldman argued, socialism *"was led astray by the evil spirit of
politics"* and *"landed in the [political] trap and has now but one
desire - to adjust itself to the narrow confines of its cage, to become
part of the authority, part of the very power that has slain the
beautiful child Socialism and left behind a hideous monster."* [**Red
Emma Speaks**, p. 103] The net effect of *"political action"* was the
corruption of the socialist movement into a reformist party which
betrayed the promise of socialism in favour of making existing society
better (so it can last longer). This process confirmed Bakunin's
predictions. As Kropotkin put it:

> *"The middle class will not give up its power without a struggle. It
> will resist. And in proportion as Socialists will become part of the
> Government and share power with the middle class, their Socialism will
> grow paler and paler. This is, indeed, what Socialism is rapidly
> doing. Were this no so, the middle classes . . . would not share their
> power with the Socialists."* [**Evolution and Environment**, p. 102]

In addition, as we argue in [section J.2.5](secJ2.html#secj25), direct
action is either based on (or creates) forms of self-managed working
class organisations. The process of collective struggle, in other words,
necessitates collective forms of organisation and decision making. These
combative organisations, as well as conducting the class struggle under
capitalism, can also be the framework of a free society (see [section
H.1.4](secH1.html#sech14)). However, standing in elections does **not**
produce such alternative social structures and, indeed, hinders them as
the focus for social changes becomes a few leaders working in existing
(i.e. bourgeois) structures and bodies (see [section
H.1.5](secH1.html#sech15)).

As can be seen, anarchists reject *"political"* struggle (i.e.
electioneering) for good (and historically vindicated) reasons. This
makes a mockery of Marxists assertions (beginning with Marx) that
anarchists like Bakunin *"opposed all political action by the working
class since this would imply 'recognition' of the existing state."*
[Derek Howl, *"The Legacy of Hal Draper,"* pp. 13-49, **International
Socialism**, no. 52, p. 147] This, in fact, is a common Marxist claim,
namely that anarchists reject *"political struggle"* on principle (i.e.
for idealistic purposes). In the words of Engels, Bakunin was *"opposed
to all political action by the working class, since this would in fact
involve recognition of the existing state."* [Marx, Engels and Lenin,
**Anarchism and Anarcho-Syndicalism**, p. 49] Sadly, like all Marxists,
he failed to indicate where, in fact, Bakunin actually said that. As can
be seen, this was **not** the case. Bakunin, like all revolutionary
anarchists, rejected *"political action"* (in the sense of
electioneering) simply because they feared that such tactics would be
counterproductive and undermine the revolutionary nature of the labour
movement. As the experience of Marxist Social Democracy showed, he was
correct.

In summary, while anarchists reject standing of socialists in elections
(*"political action,"* narrowly defined), we do not reject the need to
fight for political reforms or specific political issues. However, we
see such action as being based on collective working class **direct
action** organised around combative organs of working class
self-management and power rather than the individualistic act of placing
a cross on a piece of power once every few years and letting leaders
fight your struggles for you.

H.2.14 Are anarchist organisations *"ineffective,"* *"elitist"* or *"downright bizarre"*?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Marxists often accuse anarchist organisations of being *"elitist"* or
*"secret."* Pat Stack (of the British SWP) ponders the history of
anarchist organisation (at least the SWP version of that history):

> "how otherwise [than Leninist vanguard political parties] do
> revolutionaries organise? Apart from the serious efforts of
> anarcho-syndicalists to grapple with this problem, anarchists have
> failed to pose any serious alternative. In as much as they do, they
> have produced either the ineffective, the elitist or the downright
> bizarre. Bakunin's organisation, the 'Alliance of Social Democracy',
> managed all three: 'The organisation had two overlapping forms, one
> secret, involving only the "intimates", and one public, the Alliance
> of Social Democracy. Even in its open, public mode, the alliance was
> to be a highly centralised organisation, with all decisions on the
> national level approved by the Central Committee. Since it was the
> real controlling body, the secret organisation was even more tightly
> centralised . . . with first a Central Committee, then a "central
> Geneva section" acting as the "permanent delegation of the permanent
> Central Committee", and, finally, within the central Geneva section a
> "Central Bureau", which was to be both the "executive power . . .
> composed of three, or five, or even seven members" of the secret
> organisation and the executive directory of the public organisation.'
> "That this was far more elitist and less democratic than Lenin's model
> is clear." [*"Anarchy in the UK?"*, **Socialist Review**, no. 246]

There are, as is obvious, numerous problems with Stack's assertions.
Firstly, he makes absolutely **no** attempt to discuss anarchist ideas
on the question of revolutionary organisation. Rather, he prefers to
present a somewhat distorted account of the ideas of Bakunin on the
structural aspects of his organisation, ideas which died with him in
1876! Secondly, as Stack fails to discuss how anarchists (including
Bakunin) see their organisations operating, its hard to determine
whether they are *"ineffective"* or *"elitist."* This is hardly
surprising, as they are neither. Thirdly, even as regards his own
example (Bakunin's Alliance) his claim that it was *"ineffectual"* seems
inappropriate in the extreme. Whether it was *"elitist"* or *"downright
bizarre"* is hard to determine, as Stack quotes an unnamed author and
their quotes from its structure. Fourthly, and ironically for Stack,
Lenin's *"model"* shared many of the same features as those of
Bakunin's!

Significantly, Stack fails to discuss any of the standard anarchist
ideas on how revolutionaries should organise. As we discuss in [section
J.3](secJ3.html), there are three main types: the *"synthesis"*
federation, the *"class struggle"* federation and those inspired by the
*"Platform."* In the twenty-first century, these are the main types of
anarchist organisation. As such, it would be extremely hard to argue
that these are *"elitist,"* *"ineffective"* or *"downright bizarre."*
What these organisational ideas have in common is the vision of an
anarchist organisation as a federation of autonomous self-managed groups
which work with others as equals. How can directly democratic
organisations, which influence others by the force of their ideas and by
their example, be *"elitist"* or *"downright bizarre"*? Little wonder,
then, that Stack used an example from 1868 to attack anarchism in the
twenty-first century! If he actually presented an honest account of
anarchist ideas then his claims would quickly be seen to be nonsense.
And as for the claim of being *"ineffective,"* well, given that Stack's
article is an attempt to combat anarchist influence in the
anti-globalisation movement it would suggest the opposite.

Even looking at the example of Bakunin's Alliance, we can see evidence
that Stack's summary is simply wrong. It seems strange for Stack to
claim that the Alliance was *"ineffective."* After all, Marx spent many
years combating it (and Bakunin's influence) in the First International.
Indeed, so effective was it that anarchist ideas dominated most sections
of that organisation, forcing Marx to move the General Council to
America to ensure that it did not fall into the hands of the anarchists
(i.e. of the majority). Moreover, it was hardly *"ineffective"* when it
came to building the International. As Marxist Paul Thomas notes, *"the
International was to prove capable of expanding its membership only at
the behest of the Bakuninists [sic!]"* and *"[w]herever the
International was spreading, it was doing so under the mantle of
Bakuninism."* [**Karl Marx and the Anarchists**, p. 315 and p. 319] Even
Engels had to admit that the Spanish section was *"one of finest
organisations within the International* (which the Spanish Marxists had
to *"rescue from the influence of the Alliance humbugs"*). [**Collected
Works**, vol. 23, p. 292]

Yet Stack considers this as an example of an *"ineffective"*
organisation! But, to be fair, this seems to have been a common failing
with Marxists. In 1877, for example, Engels showed his grasp of things
by saying *"we may safely predict that the new departure [in Spain] will
not come from these 'anarchist' spouters, but from the small body of
intelligent and energetic workmen who, in 1872, remained true to the
International."* [Marx, Engels, Lenin, **Anarchism and
Anarcho-Syndicalism**, p. 163] In reality, the Spanish Socialist Party
was bureaucratic and reformist to the core while it was the anarchists
who made the Spanish labour movement the most dynamic and revolutionary
in the world.

As regards Stack's summary of Bakunin's organisation goes, we must note
that Stack is quoting an unnamed source on Bakunin's views on this
subject. We, therefore, have no way of evaluating whether this is a
valid summary of Bakunin's ideas on this matter. As we indicate
elsewhere (see [section J.3.7](secJ3.html#secj37)) Leninist summaries of
Bakunin's ideas on secret organising usually leave a lot to be desired
(by usually leaving a lot out or quoting out of context certain
phrases). As such, and given the total lack of relevance of this model
for anarchists since the 1870s, we will not bother to discuss this
summary. Simply put, it is a waste of time to discuss an organisational
model which no modern anarchist supports.

Moreover, there is a key way in which Bakunin's ideas on this issue were
far **less** *"elitist"* and **more** *"democratic"* than Lenin's model.
Simply, Bakunin always stressed that his organisation *"rules out any
idea of dictatorship and custodial control."* [**Michael Bakunin:
Selected Writings**, p. 172] The *"main purpose and task of the
organisation,"* he argued, would be to *"help the people to achieve
self-determination."* It would *"not threaten the liberty of the people
because it is free from all official character"* and *"not placed above
the people like state power."* Its programme *"consists of the fullest
realisation of the liberty of the people"* and its influence is *"not
contrary to the free development and self-determination of the people,
or its organisation from below according to its own customs and
instincts because it acts on the people only by the natural personal
influence of its members who are not invested with any power."* Thus the
revolutionary group would be the *"helper"* of the masses, with an
"organisation within the people itself." [quoted by Michael Confino,
**Daughter of a Revolutionary**, p. 259, p. 261, p. 256 and p. 261] The
revolution itself would see *"an end to all masters and to domination of
every kind, and the free construction of popular life in accordance with
popular needs, not from above downward, as in the state, but from below
upward, by the people themselves, dispensing with all governments and
parliaments - a voluntary alliance of agricultural and factory worker
associations, communes, provinces, and nations; and, finally, . . .
universal human brotherhood triumphing on the ruins of all the states."*
[Bakunin, **Statism and Anarchy**, p. 33] In other words, Bakunin saw
the social revolution in terms of popular participation and control,
**not** the seizing of power by a "revolutionary" party or group.

Unlike Lenin, Bakunin did not confuse party power with people power. His
organisation, for all it faults (and they were many), did not aim to
take power in the name of the working class and exercise power through a
centralised, top-down state. Rather, its would be based on the *"natural
influence"* of its members within mass organisations. The influence of
anarchists would, therefore, be limited to the level by which their
specific ideas were accepted by other members of the same organisations
after discussion and debate. As regards the nature of the labour
movement, we must point out that Bakunin provided the same *"serious"*
answer as the anarcho-syndicalists - namely, revolutionary labour
unionism. As we discuss in [section H.2.8](secH2.html#sech28), Bakunin's
ideas on this matter are nearly identical to those of the syndicalists
Stack praises.

As noted, however, no anarchist group has reproduced the internal
structure of the Alliance, which means that Stack's point is simply
historical in nature. Sadly this is not the case with his own politics
as the ideas he attacks actually parallel Lenin's model in many ways
(although, as indicated above, how Bakunin's organisation would function
in the class struggle was fundamentally different, as Lenin's party
sought power for itself). Given that Stack is proposing Lenin's model as
a viable means of organising revolutionaries, it is useful to summarise
it. We shall take as an example two statements issued by the Second
World Congress of the Communist International in 1920 under the
direction of Lenin. These are *"Twenty-One Conditions of Communism"* and
*"Theses on the Role of the Communist Party in the Proletarian
Revolution."* These two documents provide a vision of Leninist
organisation which is fundamentally elitist.

Lenin's *"model"* is clear from these documents. The parties adhering to
the Communist International had to have two overlapping forms, one legal
(i.e. public) and another *"illegal"* (i.e. secret). It was the *"duty"*
of these parties *"to create everywhere a parallel illegal
organisational apparatus."* [**Proceedings and Documents of the Second
Congress 1920**, vol. 2, p. 767] Needless to say, this illegal
organisation would be the real controlling body, as it would have to be
made up of trusted communists and could only be even more tightly
centralised than the open party as its members could only be appointed
from above by the illegal organisation's central committee. To stress
that the *"illegal"* (i.e. secret) organisation controlled the party,
the Communist International agreed that that *"[i]n countries where the
bourgeoisie . . . is still in power, the Communist parties must learn to
combine legal and illegal activity in a planned way. However, the legal
work must be placed under the actual control of the illegal party at all
times."* [**Op. Cit.**, vol. 1, p. 198-9] In this, it should be noted,
the Leninists followed Marx's in 1850 comments (which he later rejected)
on the need to *"establish an independent secret and public organisation
of the workers' party."* [**Collected Works**, vol. 10, p. 282]

Even in its open, public mode, the Communist Party was to be a highly
centralised organisation, with all decisions on the national level made
by the Central Committee. The parties must be as centralised as
possible, with a party centre which has strength and authority and is
equipped with the most comprehensive powers. Also, the party press and
other publications, and all party publishing houses, must be
subordinated to the party presidium. This applied on an international
level as well, with the decisions of the Communist International's
Executive Committee binding on all parties belonging to it. [**Op.
Cit.**, vol. 2, p. 769] Moreover, *"Communist cells of all kinds must be
subordinate to each other in a strictly hierarchical order of rank as
precisely as possible."* Democratic centralism itself was fundamentally
hierarchical, with its *"basic principles"* being that *"the higher
bodies shall be elected by the lower, that all instructions of the
higher bodies are categorically and necessarily binding on the lower."*
Indeed, *"there shall be a strong party centre whose authority is
universally and unquestionably recognised for all leading party comrades
in the period between congresses."* Any *"advocacy of broad 'autonomy'
for the local party organisations only weakens the ranks of the
Communist Party"* and *"favours petty-bourgeois, anarchist and
disruptive tendencies."* [**Op. Cit.**, vol. 1, p. 198]

It seems strange for Stack to argue that Bakunin's ideas (assuming he
presents an honest account of them, of course) were *"far more elitist
and less democratic than Lenin's model"* as they obviously were not.
Indeed, the similarities between Stack's summary of Bakunin's ideas and
Leninist theory are striking. The Leninist party has the same division
between open and secret (legal and illegal) structures as in Bakunin's,
the same centralism and top-down nature. Lenin argued that *"[i]n all
countries, even in those that are freest, most 'legal,' and most
'peaceful' . . . it is now absolutely indispensable for every Communist
Party to systematically combine legal and illegal work, legal and
illegal organisation."* He stressed that *"[o]nly the most reactionary
philistine, no matter what cloak of fine 'democratic' and pacifist
phrases he may don, will deny this fact or the conclusion that of
necessity follows from it, viz., that all legal Communist parties must
immediately form illegal organisations for the systematic conduct of
illegal work."* [**Collected Works**, vol. 31, p. 195] This was due to
the threat of state repression, which also faced Bakunin's Alliance. As
Murray Bookchin argued, *"Bakunin's emphasis on conspiracy and secrecy
can be understood only against the social background of Italy, Spain,
and Russia the three countries in Europe where conspiracy and secrecy
were matters of sheer survival."* [**The Spanish Anarchists**, p. 24]

For anarchists, the similarity in structure between Bakunin and Lenin is
no source of embarrassment. Rather, we argue that it is due to a
similarity in political conditions in Russia and **not** similarities in
political ideas. If we look at Bakunin's ideas on social revolution and
the workers' movement we see a fully libertarian perspective - of a
movement from the bottom-up, based on the principles of direct action,
self-management and federalism. Anarchists since his death have applied
**these** ideas to the specific anarchist organisation as well,
rejecting the non-libertarian elements of Bakunin's ideas which Stack
correctly (if somewhat hypocritically and dishonestly) denounces. All in
all, Stack has shown himself to be a hypocrite or, at best, a *"most
reactionary philistine"* (to use Lenin's choice expression).

In addition, it would be useful to evaluate the effectiveness of Stack's
Leninist alternative. Looking at the outcome of the Russian Revolution,
we can only surmise that it is not very effective. This was because its
goal is meant to be a socialist society based on soviet democracy. Did
the Russian Revolution actually result in such a society? Far from it.
The Kronstadt revolt was repressed in 1921 because it demanded soviet
democracy. Nor was this an isolated example. The Bolsheviks had been
disbanding soviets with elected non-Bolshevik majorities since early
1918 (i.e. **before** the start of the Civil War) and by 1920 leading
Bolsheviks were arguing that dictatorship of the proletariat could only
be expressed by means of the dictatorship of the party. Clearly, the
Bolshevik method is hardly *"effective"* in the sense of achieving its
stated goals. Nor was it particularly effective before the revolution
either. During the 1905 revolution, the Bolsheviks opposed the councils
of workers' deputies (soviets) which had been formed and gave them an
ultimatum: either accept the programme of the Bolsheviks or else
disband! The soviets ignored them. In February 1917 the Bolshevik party
opposed the actions that produced the revolution which overthrew the
Tsar. Simply put, the one event that validates the Bolshevik model is
the October Revolution of 1917 and even that failed (see [section
H.5.12](secH5.html#sech512)).

Moreover, it backfires on his own politics. The very issues which Stack
raises as being *"elitist"* in Bakunin (secret and open organisation,
centralisation, top-down decision making) are shared by Lenin. Given
that no other anarchist organisation has ever followed the Alliance
structure (and, indeed, it is even doubtful the Alliance followed it!),
it makes a mockery of the scientific method to base a generalisation on
an exception rather than the norm (indeed, the only exception). For
Stack to use Bakunin's ideas on this issue as some kind of evidence
against anarchism staggers belief. Given that anarchists reject
Bakunin's ideas on this subject while Leninists continue to subscribe to
Lenin's, it is very clear that Stack is being extremely hypocritical in
this matter.

One of Stack's comrades in the SWP highlighted another of the great
Marxist myths about anarchist organisation when he stated categorically
that *"[a]ll the major anarchist organisations in history have been
centralised but have operated in secret."* As evidence they echo Stack's
distortions of Bakunin's Alliance before stating that the *"anarchist
organisation inside the Spanish C.N.T., the F.A.I., was centralised and
secret. A revolutionary party thrives on open debate and common struggle
with wider groups of workers."* [**Socialist Worker**, no. 1714,
16/09/2000]

It is just as well it stated *"all the major anarchist organisations"*
as it is vague enough to allow the denial of obvious counter-examples as
not being "major" enough. We can point to hundreds of anarchist
organisations that are/were not secret. For example, the Italian
Anarchist Union (UAI) was a non-secret organisation. Given that it had
around 20,000 members in 1920, we wonder by what criteria the SWP
excludes it from being a *"major anarchist organisation"*? After all,
estimates of the membership of the F.A.I. vary from around 6,000 to
around 30,000. Bakunin's "Alliance" amounted to, at most, under 100. In
terms of size, the UAI was equal to the F.A.I. and outnumbered the
"Alliance" considerably. Why was the UAI not a *"major anarchist
organisation"*? Then there are the French anarchist organisations. In
the 1930, the **Union Anarchiste** had over 2,000 members, an
influential newspaper and organised many successful public meetings and
campaigns (see David Berry's **A History of the French Anarchist
movement, 1917-1945** for details). Surely that counts as a *"major
anarchist organisation"*? Today, the French Anarchist Federation has a
weekly newspaper and groups all across France as well as in Belgium.
That is not secret and is one of the largest anarchist organisations in
the world. We wonder why the SWP excluded such examples? Needless to
say, all of these were based on federal structures rather than
centralised ones.

As for the Spanish Anarchists, the common Leninist notion that it was
centralised seems to flow from Felix Morrow's assertion that *"Spanish
Anarchism had in the FAI a highly centralised party apparatus through
which it maintained control of the CNT."* [**Revolution and
Counter-Revolution in Spain**, p. 100] Like the SWP, no attempt was made
to provide evidence to support this claim. It undoubtedly flows from the
dogmatic Leninist belief that centralism is automatically more efficient
than federalism combined with the fact that the Leninists could not take
over the CNT. However, in reality, the FAI neither controlled the CNT
nor was it centralised or secret.

The FAI - the Iberian Anarchist Federation - was a federation of
regional federations (including the Portuguese Anarchist Union). These
regional federations, in turn, were federations of highly autonomous
anarchist affinity groups. *"Like the CNT,"* noted Murray Bookchin,
*"the FAI was structured along confederal lines . . . Almost as a matter
of second nature, dissidents were permitted a considerable amount of
freedom in voicing and publishing material against the leadership and
established policies."* The FAI *"was more loosely jointed as an
organisation than many of its admirers and critics seem to recognise. It
has no bureaucratic apparatus, no membership cards or dues, and no
headquarters with paid officials, secretaries, and clerks. . . They
jealously guarded the autonomy of their affinity groups from the
authority of higher organisational bodies - a state of mind hardly
conducive to the development of a tightly knit, vanguard organisation .
. . It had no official program by which all **faistas** could
mechanically guide their actions."* [**The Spanish Anarchists**, pp.
197-8] So regardless of Morrow's claims, the FAI was a federation of
autonomous affinity groups in which, as one member put it, *"[e]ach FAI
group thought and acted as it deemed fit, without bothering about what
the others might be thinking or deciding . . . they had no . . .
opportunity or jurisdiction . . . to foist a party line upon the
grass-roots."* [Francisco Carrasquer, quoted by Stuart Christie, **We,
the Anarchists!**, p. 28]

Was the F.A.I. a "secret" organisation? When it was founded in 1927,
Spain was under the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera and so it was
illegal and secret by necessity. As Stuart Christie correctly notes,
*"[a]s an organisation publicly committed to the overthrow of the
dictatorship, the F.A.I. functioned, from 1927 to 1931, as an illegal
rather than a secret organisation. From the birth of the Republic in
1931 onwards, the F.A.I. was simply an organisation which, until 1937,
refused to register as an organisation as required by Republican Law."*
[**Op. Cit.**, p. 24] Thus it was illegal rather than secret. As one
anarchist militant asked, *"[i]f it was secret, how come I was able to
attend F.A.I. meetings without ever having joined or paid dues to the
'specific' organisation?"* [Francesco Carrasquer, quoted by Christie,
**Op. Cit.**, p. 24] The organisation held public meetings, attended by
thousands, as well as journals and newspapers. Its most notable members,
such as Durruti, hardly kept their affiliation secret. Moreover, given
the periods of repression suffered by the Spanish libertarian movement
throughout its history (including being banned and forced underground
during the Republic) being an illegal organisation made perfect sense.
The SWP, like most Marxists, ignore historical context and so mislead
the reader.

Did the F.A.I. ignore *"open debate and common struggle."* No, of course
not. The members of the F.A.I. were also members of the C.N.T. The
C.N.T. was based around mass assemblies in which all members could
speak. It was here that members of the F.A.I. took part in forming
C.N.T. policy along with other C.N.T. members. Anarchists in the C.N.T.
who were not members of the F.A.I. indicate this. Jose Borras Casacarosa
noted that *"[o]ne has to recognise that the F.A.I. did not intervene in
the C.N.T. from above or in an authoritarian manner as did other
political parties in the unions. It did so from the base through
militants . . . the decisions which determined the course taken by the
C.N.T. were taken under constant pressure from these militants."* Jose
Campos states that F.A.I. militants *"tended to reject control of
confederal committees and only accepted them on specific occasions . . .
if someone proposed a motion in assembly, the other F.A.I. members would
support it, usually successfully. It was the individual standing of the
faista in open assembly."* [quoted by Stuart Christie, **Op. Cit.**, p.
62] It should be remembered that at union conferences and congresses the
*"delegates, whether or not they were members of the FAI, were
presenting resolutions adopted by their unions at open membership
meetings. Actions taken at the congress had to be reported back to their
unions at open meetings, and given the degree of union education among
the members, it was impossible for delegates to support personal,
non-representative positions."* [Juan Gomez Casas, **Anarchist
Organisation: The History of the FAI**, p. 121]

Significantly, it should be noted that Morrow was re-cycling an argument
which was produced by the reformist wing of the CNT in the 1930s after
it had lost influence in the union rank-and-file (*"The myth of the FAI
as conqueror and ruler of the CNT was created basically by the
**Treinistas**."* [Juan Gomez Casas, **Op. Cit.**, p. 134] ). That a
Trotskyist should repeat the arguments of failed bureaucrats in the CNT
is not too surprising in that Trotskyism itself is simply the ideology
of Russian failed bureaucrats.

Clearly, the standard Marxist account of anarchist organisations leave a
lot to be desired. They concentrate on just one or two examples (almost
always Bakunin's Alliance or the FAI, usually both) and ignore the vast
bulk of anarchist organisations. Their accounts of the atypical
organisations they do pick is usually flawed, particularly in the case
of the FAI where they simply do not understand the historic context nor
how it actually did organise. Finally, somewhat ironically, in their
attacks on Bakunin's ideas they fail to note the similarities between
his ideas and Lenin's and, equally significantly, the key areas in which
they differ. All in all, anarchists would argue that it is Leninist
ideas on the vanguard party which are *"elitist,"* *"ineffective"* and
*"downright bizarre."* As we discuss in [section H.5](secH5.html), the
only thing the Leninist "revolutionary" party is effective for is
replacing one set of bosses with a new set (the leaders of the party).
