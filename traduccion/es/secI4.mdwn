I.4 How could an anarchist economy function?
============================================

This is an important question facing all opponents of a given system --
what will you replace it with? We can say, of course, that it is
pointless to make blueprints of how a future anarchist society will work
as the future will be created by everyone, not just the few anarchists
and libertarian socialists who write books and FAQs. This is very true,
we cannot predict what a free society will actually be like or develop
and we have no intention to do so here. However, this reply (whatever
its other merits) ignores a key point, people need to have some idea of
what anarchism aims for before they decide to spend their lives trying
to create it.

So, how would an anarchist system function? That depends on the economic
ideas people have. A mutualist economy will function differently than a
communist one, for example, but they will have similar features. As
Rudolf Rocker put it:

> *"Common to all Anarchists is the desire to free society of all
> political and social coercive institutions which stand in the way of
> development of a free humanity. In this sense Mutualism, Collectivism
> and Communism are not to be regarded as closed systems permitting no
> further development, but merely as economic assumptions as to the
> means of safeguarding a free community. There will even probably be in
> society of the future different forms of economic co-operation
> operating side by side, since any social progress must be associated
> with that free experiment and practical testing out for which in a
> society of free communities there will be afforded every
> opportunity."* [**Anarcho-Syndicalism**, p. 9]

So given the common ideals and aims of anarchists, it is unsurprising
that the economic systems we suggest has common features such as
workers' self-management, federation, free agreement and so on (as
discussed in [last section](secI3.html)). For all anarchists, *"[t]he
task for a modern industrial society is to achieve what is now
technically realisable, namely, a society which is really based on free
voluntary participation of people who produce and create, live their
lives freely within institutions they control, and with limited
hierarchical structures, possibly none at all."* [Noam Chomsky, quoted
by Albert and Hahnel, **Looking Forward**, p. 62]

This achieved by means of *"voluntary association that will organise
labour, and be the manufacturer and distributor of necessary
commodities"* and this *"**is to make what is useful. The individual is
to make what is beautiful.**"* [Oscar Wilde, **The Soul of Man Under
Socialism**, p. 1183] For example, the machine *"will supersede
hand-work in the manufacture of plain goods. But at the same time,
hand-work very probably will extend its domain in the artistic finishing
of many things which are made entirely in the factory."* [Peter
Kropotkin, **Fields, Factories and Workplaces Tomorrow**, p. 152] Murray
Bookchin, decades later, argued for the same idea: *"the machine will
remove the toil from the productive process, leaving its artistic
completion to man."* [**Post-Scarcity Anarchism**, p. 134]

The aim would be to maximise the time available for individuals to
express and development their individuality, including in production. As
Stirner put it, the *"organisation of labour touches only such labours
as others can do for us. . . the rest remain egoistic, because no one
can in your stead elaborate your musical compositions, carry out your
projects of painting, etc.; nobody can replace Raphael's labours. The
latter are labours of a unique person, which only he is competent to
achieve."* Criticising the authoritarian socialists of his time, Stirner
went on to ask *"for whom is time to be gained [by association]? For
what does man require more time than is necessary to refresh his wearied
powers of labour? Here Communism is silent."* He then answers his own
question by arguing it is gained for the individual *"[t]o take comfort
in himself as unique, after he has done his part as man!"* [Max Stirner,
**The Ego and Its Own**, p. 268 and p. 269] Which is exactly what
libertarian communists argue:

> *"[We] recognise that man [sic!] has other needs besides food, and as
> the strength of Anarchy lies precisely in that it understands **all**
> human faculties and **all** passions, and ignores none, we shall . . .
> contrive to satisfy all his intellectual and artistic needs . . . the
> man [or woman] who will have done the four or five hours of . . . work
> that are necessary for his existence, will have before him five or six
> hours which his will seek to employ according to tastes . . .*

> *"He will discharge his task in the field, the factory, and so on,
> which he owes to society as his contribution to the general
> production. And he will employ the second half of his day, his week,
> or his year, to satisfy his artistic or scientific needs, or his
> hobbies."* [Kropotkin, **Conquest of Bread**, pp. 110-1]

Thus, while **authoritarian** Communism ignores the unique individual
(and that was the only kind of Communism existing when Stirner wrote his
classic book) **libertarian** communists agree with Stirner and are not
silent. Like him, they consider the whole point of organising labour is
to provide the means of providing the individual with the time and
resources required to express their individuality. In other words, to
pursue *"labours of a unique person."* Thus all anarchists base their
arguments for a free society on how it will benefit actual individuals,
rather than abstracts or amorphous collectives (such as "society").
Hence chapter 9 of **The Conquest of Bread**, *"The Need for Luxury"*
and, for that matter, chapter 10, *"Agreeable Work."*

In other words, anarchists desire to organise voluntary workers
associations which will try to ensure a minimisation of mindless labour
in order to maximise the time available for creative activity both
inside and outside "work." This is to be achieved by free co-operation
between equals, which is seen as being based on self-interest. After
all, while capitalist ideology may proclaim that competition is an
expression of self-interest it, in fact, results in the majority of
people sacrificing themselves for the benefits of the few who own and
control society. The time you sell to a boss in return for them ordering
you about and keeping the product of your labour is time you never get
back. Anarchists aim to end a system which crushes individuality and
create one in which solidarity and co-operation allow us time to enjoy
life and to gain the benefits of our labour ourselves. Mutual Aid, in
other words, results in a better life than mutual struggle and so *"the
**association for struggle** will be a much more effective support for
civilisation, progress, and evolution than is the **struggle for
existence** with its savage daily competitions."* [Luigi Geallani, **The
End of Anarchism**, p. 26]

In the place of the rat race of capitalism, economic activity in an
anarchist society would be one of the means to humanise and
individualise ourselves and society, to move from **surviving** to
**living.** Productive activity should become a means of
self-expression, of joy, of art, rather than something we have to do to
survive. Ultimately, "work" should become more akin to play or a hobby
than the current alienated activity. The priorities of life should be
towards individual self-fulfilment and humanising society rather than
*"running society as an adjunct to the market,"* to use Polanyi's
expression, and turning ourselves into commodities on the labour market.
Thus anarchists agree with John Stuart Mill:

> *"I confess I am not charmed with an ideal of life held out by those
> who think that the normal state of human beings is that of struggling
> to get on; that the trampling, crushing, elbowing, and treading on
> each other's heels, which form the existing type of social life, are
> the most desirable lot of human kind, or anything but the disagreeable
> symptoms of one of the phases of industrial progress."* [**Collected
> Works**, vol. III, p. 754]

The aim of anarchism is far more than the end of inequality. Hence
Proudhon's comment that socialism's *"underlying dogma"* is that the
*"objective of socialism is the emancipation of the proletariat and the
eradication of poverty."* This emancipation would be achieved by ending
*"wage slavery"* via *"democratically organised workers' associations."*
[**No Gods, No Masters**, vol. 1, p. 57 and p. 62] Or, to use
Kropotkin's expression, *"well-being for all"* -- physical, mental,
emotional and ethical! Indeed, by concentrating on just poverty and
ignoring the emancipation of the proletariat, the real aims of socialism
are obscured:

> *"The 'right to well-being' means the possibility of living like human
> beings, and of bringing up children to be members of a society better
> than ours, whilst the 'right to work' only means the right to be a
> wage-slave, a drudge, ruled over and exploited by the middle class of
> the future. The right to well-being is the Social Revolution, the
> right to work means nothing but the Treadmill of Commercialism. It is
> high time for the worker to assert his right to the common
> inheritance, and to enter into possession of it."* [Kropotkin, **Op.
> Cit.**, p. 44]

So, while refusing to define exactly how an anarchist system will work,
we will explore the implications of how the anarchist principles and
ideals outlined above could be put into practice. Bear in mind that this
is just a possible framework for a system which has few historical
examples to draw upon. This means that we can only indicate the general
outlines of what an anarchist society could be like. Those seeking
blue-prints and exactness should look elsewhere. In all likelihood, the
framework we present will be modified and changed (even ignored) in
light of the real experiences and problems people will face when
creating a new society.

We should point out that there may be a tendency for some to compare
this framework with the **theory** of capitalism (i.e. perfectly
functioning "free" markets or quasi-perfect ones) as opposed to its
reality. A perfectly working capitalist system only exists in text books
and in the heads of ideologues who take the theory as reality. No system
is perfect, particularly capitalism, and to compare "perfect" text-book
capitalism with any real system is a pointless task. As we discussed in
depth in [section C](secCcon.html), capitalist economics does not even
describe the reality of capitalism so why think it would enlighten
discussion of post-capitalist systems? What hope does it have of
understanding post-capitalist systems which reject its proprietary
despotism and inequalities? As anarchists aim for a qualitative change
in our economic relationships, we can safely say that its economic
dynamics will reflect the specific forms it will develop rather than
those produced by a class-ridden hierarchical system like capitalism and
the a-historic individualistic abstractions invented to defend it!

So any attempt to apply the notions developed from theorising about (or,
more correctly, justifying and rationalising) capitalism to anarchism
will fail to capture the dynamics of a non-capitalist system. John Crump
stressed this point in his discussion of Japanese anarchism between the
World Wars:

> *"When considering the feasibility of the social system advocated by
> the pure anarchists, we need to be clear about the criteria against
> which it should be measured. It would, for example, be unreasonable to
> demand that it be assessed against such yardsticks of a capitalist
> economy as annual rate of growth, balance of trade and so forth . . .
> evaluating anarchist communism by means of the criteria which have
> been devised to measure capitalism's performance does not make sense .
> . . capitalism would be . . . baffled if it were demanded that it

> neither were they prepared to give priority to narrowly conceived
> economic expansion, to neglect individual liberty and communal
> solidarity, as capitalism regularly does."* [**Hatta Shuzo and Pure
> Anarchism in Interwar Japan**, pp. 191-3]

Finally, anarchists are well aware that transforming how an economy
works does not happen overnight. As discussed in [section
I.2.2](secI2.html#seci22), we have long rejected the idea of
instantaneous social transformation and argued that revolution will take
time to develop and change the legacy of centuries of class and
hierarchical society. This transformation and the resulting changes in
people and surroundings can only be achieved by the full participation
of all in overcoming the (many) problems a free society will face and
the new ways of relating to each other liberation implies. A free people
will find their own practical solutions to their problems, for *"there
will be all sorts of practical difficulties to overcome, but the
[libertarian socialist] system is simplicity itself compared with the
monster of centralised State control, which sets such an inhuman
distance between the worker and the administrator that there is room for
a thousand difficulties to intervene."* [Herbert Read, **Anarchy and
Order**, p. 49] Thus, for anarchists, the *"enthusiasm generated by the
revolution, the energies liberated, and the inventiveness stimulated by
it must be given full freedom and scope to find creative channels."*
[Alexander Berkman, **What is Anarchism?**, p. 223] As such, the ideas
within this section of our FAQ are merely suggestions, possibilities.

I.4.1 What is the point of economic activity in anarchy?
--------------------------------------------------------

The basic point of economic activity is an anarchist society is to
ensure, to use Kropotkin's expression, ***"well-being for all"***.
Rather than toil to make the rich richer, people in a free society would
work together to *"ensure to society as a whole its life and further
development."* Such an economy would be based upon *"giving society the
greatest amount of useful products with the least waste of human
energy"*, to meet *"the needs of mankind"*. [**The Conquest of Bread**,
p. 43, p. 144 and p. 175] Needless to say, today we must also add: with
the least disruption of nature.

In terms of needs, it should be stressed that these are not limited to
just material goods (important as they may be, particularly to those
currently living in poverty). Needs also extend to having meaningful
work which you control, pleasant and ecologically viable surroundings,
the ability to express oneself freely within and outwith work, and a
host of other things associated with the quality of life rather than
merely survival. Anarchism seeks to transform economic activity rather
than merely liberate it by self-management (important as that is).

Therefore, for anarchists, *"[r]eal wealth consists of things of utility
and beauty, in things that help create strong, beautiful bodies and
surroundings inspiring to live in."* Anarchism's *"goal is the freest
possible expression of all the latent powers of the individual"* and
this *"is only possible in a state of society where man [sec!] is free
to choose the mode of work, the conditions of work, and the freedom to
work. One whom making a table, the building of a house, or the tilling
of the soil is what the painting is to the artist and the discovery to
the scientist -- the result of inspiration, of intense longing, and deep
interest in work as a creative force."* [Emma Goldman, **Red Emma
Speaks**, p. 67 and p. 68]

So the point of economic activity in an anarchist society is to produce
as and when required and not, as under capitalism, to organise
production for the sake of production in order to make profits for the
few. Production, to use Kropotkin's words, is to become *"the mere
servant of consumption; it must mould itself on the wants of the
consumer, not dictate to him [or her] conditions."* [**Act For
Yourselves**, p. 57] This should **not** be taken to imply that
anarchism seeks production for the sake of production in order to meet
all the needs of all. Far from it, as such a regime would, to quote
Malatesta, involve *"employing **all** of one's strength in producing
things, because taken literally, this would mean working until one is
exhausted, which would mean that by maximising the satisfaction of human
needs we destroy humanity."* In other words, a free society would take
into account the wants of the producers (and the planet we live on) when
meeting the wants of consumers. Thus, there would be a balance sought.
*"What we would like,"* continued Malatesta, *"is for everybody to live
in the best possible way: so that everybody with a minimum amount of
effort will obtain maximum satisfaction."* [**At the Café**, p. 61]

So while the basic aim of economic activity in an anarchist society is,
obviously, producing wealth -- i.e., satisfying individual needs --
without enriching capitalists or other parasites in the process, it is
far more than that. Yes, an anarchist society will aim to create society
in which everyone will have a standard of living suitable for a fully
human life. Yes, it will aim to eliminate poverty, inequality,
individual want and social waste and squalor, but it aims for far more
than that. It aims to create free individuals who express their
individuality within and outwith "work." After all, what is the most
important thing that comes out of a workplace? Pro-capitalists may say
profits, others the finished commodity or good. In fact, the most
important thing that comes out of a workplace is the **worker.** What
happens to us in the workplace will have an impact on all aspects of our
life and so cannot be ignored.

To value "efficiency" above all else, as capitalism says it does (it, in
fact, values **profits** above all else and hinders developments like
workers' control which increase efficiency but harm power and profits),
is to deny our own humanity and individuality. Without an appreciation
for grace and beauty there is no pleasure in creating things and no
pleasure in having them. Our lives are made drearier rather than richer
by "progress." How can a person take pride in their work when skill and
care are considered luxuries (if not harmful to "efficiency" and, under
capitalism, the profits and power of the capitalist and manager)? We are
not machines. We have a need for craftspersonship and anarchism
recognises this and takes it into account in its vision of a free
society. This means that, in an anarchist society, economic activity is
the process by which we produce what is useful but, in addition, is also
beautiful (to use Oscar Wilde's words) in a way that empowers the
individual. We anarchists charge capitalism with wasting human energy
and time due to its irrational nature and workings, energy that could be
spent creating what is beautiful (both in terms of individualities and
products of labour). Under capitalism we are *"toiling to live, that we
may live to toil."* [William Morris, **Useful Work Versus Useless
Toil**, p. 37]

In addition, we must stress that the aim of economic activity within an
anarchist society is **not** to create equality of outcome -- i.e.
everyone getting exactly the same goods. As we noted in [section
A.2.5](secA2.html#seca25), such a "vision" of "equality" attributed to
socialists by pro-capitalists indicates more the poverty of imagination
and ethics of the critics of socialism than a true account of socialist
ideas. Anarchists, like other genuine socialists, support **social**
equality in order to maximise freedom, including the freedom to choose
between options to satisfy ones needs. To treat people equally, as
equals, means to respect their desires and interests, to acknowledge
their right to equal liberty. To make people consume the same as
everyone else does not respect the equality of all to develop ones
abilities as one sees fit. Socialism means equality of opportunity to
satisfy desires and interests, not the imposition of an abstract minimum
(or maximum) on unique individuals. To treat unique individuals equally
means to acknowledge that uniqueness, not to deny it.

Thus the **real** aim of economic activity within an anarchy is to
ensure *"that every human being should have the material and moral means
to develop his humanity."* [Michael Bakunin, **The Political Philosophy
of Bakunin**, p. 295] And you cannot develop your humanity if you cannot
express yourself freely. Needless to say, to treat unique people
"equally" (i.e. identically) is simply evil. You cannot, say, have a 70
year old woman do the same work in order to receive the same income as a
20 year old man. No, anarchists do not subscribe to such "equality,"
which is a product of the *"ethics of mathematics"* of capitalism and
**not** of anarchist ideals. Such a scheme is alien to a free society.
The equality anarchists desire is a social equality, based on control
over the decisions that affect you. The aim of anarchist economic
activity, therefore, is to provide the goods required for *"equal
freedom for all, an equality of conditions such as to allow everyone to
do as they wish."* [Errico Malatesta, **Errico Malatesta: His Life and
Ideas**, p. 49] Thus anarchists *"demand not natural but social equality
of individuals as the condition for justice and the foundations of
morality."* [Bakunin, **Op. Cit.**, p. 249]

Under capitalism, instead of humans controlling production, production
controls them. Anarchists want to change this and desire to create an
economic network which will allow the maximisation of an individual's
free time in order for them to express and develop their individuality
(while creating what is beautiful). So instead of aiming just to produce
because the economy will collapse if we did not, anarchists want to
ensure that we produce what is useful in a manner which liberates the
individual and empowers them in all aspects of their lives.

This desire means that anarchists reject the capitalist definition of
"efficiency." Anarchists would agree with Albert and Hahnel when they
argue that *"since people are conscious agents whose characteristics and
therefore preferences develop over time, to access long-term efficiency
we must access the impact of economic institutions on people's
development."* Capitalism, as we have explained before, is highly
inefficient in this light due to the effects of hierarchy and the
resulting marginalisation and disempowerment of the majority of society.
As Albert and Hahnel go on to note, *"self-management, solidarity, and
variety are all legitimate valuative criteria for judging economic
institutions . . . Asking whether particular institutions help people
attain self-management, variety, and solidarity is sensible."* [**The
Political Economy of Participatory Economics**, p. 9]

In other words, anarchists think that any economic activity in a free
society is to do useful things in such a way that gives those doing it
as much pleasure as possible. The point of such activity is to express
the individuality of those doing it, and for that to happen they must
control the work process itself. Only by self-management can work become
a means of empowering the individual and developing his or her powers.

In a nutshell, to use the words of William Morris, useful work will
replace useless toil in an anarchist society.

I.4.2 Why do anarchists desire to abolish work?
-----------------------------------------------

Anarchists desire to see humanity liberate itself from work. This may
come as a shock for many people and will do much to "prove" that
anarchism is essentially utopian. However, we think that such an
abolition is not only necessary, it is possible. This is because work as
we know it today is one of the major dangers to freedom we face.

If by freedom we mean self-government, then it is clear that being
subjected to hierarchy in the workplace subverts our abilities to think
and judge for ourselves. Like any skill, critical analysis and
independent thought have to be practised continually in order to remain
at their full potential. So a workplace environment with power
structures undermines these abilities. This was recognised by Adam Smith
who argued that the *"understandings of the greater part of men are
necessarily formed by their ordinary employments."* That being so, *"the
man whose life is spent in performing a few simple operations, of which
the effects too are, perhaps, always the same, or nearly the same, has
no occasion to extend his understanding . . . and generally becomes as
stupid and ignorant as it is possible for a human creature to be . . .
But in every improved and civilised society this is the state into which
the labouring poor, that is the great body of the people, must
necessarily fall, unless government takes pains to prevent it."* [quoted
by Noam Chomsky, **Year 501**, p. 18]

Smith's argument (usually ignored by those who claim to follow his
ideas) is backed up by extensive evidence. Different types of authority
structures and different technologies have different effects on those
who work within them. Carole Pateman notes that the evidence suggests
that *"[o]nly certain work situations were found to be conducive to the
development of the psychological characteristics"* suitable for freedom,
such as *"the feelings of personal confidence and efficacy that underlay
the sense of political efficacy."* [**Participation and Democratic
Theory**, p. 51] She quotes one expert who argues that within capitalist
companies based upon a highly rationalised work environment and
extensive division of labour, the worker has no control over the pace or
technique of his work, no room to exercise skill or leadership and so
they *"have practically no opportunity to solve problems and contribute
their own ideas."* The worker, according to a psychological study, is
*"resigned to his lot . . . more dependent than independent . . . he
lacks confidence in himself . . . he is humble . . . the most prevalent
feeling states . . . seem to be fear and anxiety."* [quoted by Pateman,
**Op. Cit.**, p. 51 and p. 52]

The evidence Pateman summarises shows that an individual's *"attitudes
will depend to a large degree on the authority structure of his [or her]
work environment"*, with workplaces which are more autocratic and with a
higher division of labour being worse for an individual's sense of
self-esteem, feelings of self-worth and autonomy. In workplaces where
*"the worker has a high degree of personal control over his [or her]
work . . . and a very large degree of freedom from external control"* or
is based on the *"collective responsibility of a crew of employees"* who
*"had control over the pace and method of getting the work done, and the
work crews were largely internally self-disciplining"* a different
social character is seen. [Pateman, **Op. Cit.**, pp. 52-3] This was
characterised by *"a strong sense of individualism and autonomy, and a
solid acceptance of citizenship in the large society"* and *"a highly
developed feeling of self-esteem and a sense of self-worth and is
therefore ready to participate in the social and political institutions
of the community."* Thus the *"nature of a man's work affects his social
character and personality"* and that an *"industrial environment tends
to breed a distinct social type."* [R. Blauner, quoted by Pateman, **Op.
Cit.**, p. 52]

Thus, to quote Bob Black (who notes that Smith's comments against the
division of labour are his *"critique of work"*), the capitalist
workplace turns us into *"stultified submissives"* and places us *"under
the sort of surveillance that ensures servility."* For this reason
anarchists desire, to use Bob Black's phrase, *"the abolition of work."*
[**The Abolition of Work and other essays**, p. 26, p. 22 and p. 19]

Work, in this context, does not mean any form of productive activity.
Far from it. Work (in the sense of doing necessary things or productive
activity) will always be with us. There is no getting away from it;
crops need to be grown, schools built, homes fixed, and so on. No, work
in this context means any form of labour in which the worker does not
control his or her own activity. In other words, **wage labour** in all
its many forms.

A society based upon hierarchical relations in production will result in
a society within which the typical worker uses few of their abilities,
exercise little or no control over their work because they are governed
by a boss during working hours. This has been proved to lower the
individual's self-esteem and feelings of self-worth, as would be
expected in any social relationship that denied self-government.
Capitalism is marked by an extreme division of labour, particularly
between mental and physical labour. It reduces the worker to a mere
machine operator, following the orders of his or her boss. Therefore, a
libertarian that does not support economic liberty (i.e.
self-management) is no libertarian at all.

Capitalism bases its rationale for itself on consumption and this
results in a viewpoint which minimises the importance of the time we
spend in productive activity. Anarchists consider that it is essential
for individual's to use and develop their unique attributes and
capacities in all walks of life, to maximise their powers. Therefore,
the idea that "work" should be ignored in favour of consumption is
totally mad. Productive activity is an important way of developing our
inner-powers and express ourselves; in other words, be creative.
Capitalism's emphasis on consumption shows the poverty of that system.
As Alexander Berkman argued:

> *"We do not live by bread alone. True, existence is not possible
> without opportunity to satisfy our physical needs. But the
> gratification of these by no means constitutes all of life. Our
> present system of disinheriting millions, made the belly the centre of
> the universe, so to speak. But in a sensible society . . . [t]he
> feelings of human sympathy, of justice and right would have a chance
> to develop, to be satisfied, to broaden and grow."* [**What is
> Anarchism?**, pp. 152-3]

Therefore, capitalism is based on a constant process of alienated
consumption, as workers try to find the happiness associated within
productive, creative, self-managed activity in a place it does not exist
-- on the shop shelves. This can partly explain the rise of both
mindless consumerism and the continuation of religions, as individuals
try to find meaning for their lives and happiness, a meaning and
happiness frustrated in wage labour and other hierarchies.

Capitalism's impoverishment of the individual's spirit is hardly
surprising. As William Godwin argued, *"[t]he spirit of oppression, the
spirit of servility, and the spirit of fraud, these are the immediate
growth of the established administration of property. They are alike
hostile to intellectual and moral improvement."* [**The Anarchist
Reader**, p. 131] Any system based on hierarchical relationships in work
will result in a deadening of the individual and in a willingness to
defer to economic masters. Which is why Anarchists desire to change this
and create a society based upon freedom in all aspects of life. Hence
anarchists desire to abolish work, simply because it restricts the
liberty and distorts the individuality of those who have to do it. To
quote Emma Goldman:

> *"Anarchism aims to strip labour of its deadening, dulling aspect, of
> its gloom and compulsion. It aims to make work an instrument of joy,
> of strength, of colour, of real harmony, so that the poorest sort of a
> man should find in work both recreation and hope."* [**Anarchism and
> Other Essays**, p. 61]

Anarchists do not think that by getting rid of work we will not have to
produce necessary goods. Far from it. An anarchist society *"doesn't
mean we have to stop doing things. It does mean creating a new way of
life based on play; in other words, a ludic revolution . . . a
collective adventure in generalised joy and freely interdependent
exuberance. Play isn't passive."* The aim is *"to abolish work and
replace it, insofar as it serves useful purposes, with a multitude of
new kinds of free activities. To abolish work requires going at it from
two directions, quantitative and qualitative."* In terms of the first,
*"we need to cut down massively the amount of working being done"*
(luckily, *"most work is useless or worse and we should simply get rid
of it"*). For the second, *"we have to take what useful work remains and
transform it into a pleasing variety of game-like and craft-like
pastimes, indistinguishable from other pleasurable pastimes, except that
the happen to yield useful end-products."* [Bob Black, **Op. Cit.**, p.
17 and p. 28]

This means that in an anarchist society every effort would be made to
reduce boring, unpleasant activity to a minimum and ensure that whatever
productive activity is required to be done is as pleasant as possible
and based upon voluntary labour. However, it is important to remember
Cornelius Castoriadis point: *"Socialist society will be able to reduce
the length of the working day, and will have to do so, but this will not
be the fundamental preoccupation. Its first task will be to . . .
transform the very nature of work. The problem is not to leave more and
more 'free' time to individuals -- which might well be **empty** time --
so that they may fill it at will with 'poetry' or the carving of wood.
The problem is to make all time a time of liberty and to allow concrete
freedom to find expression in creative activity."* Essentially, the
*"problem is to put poetry into work."* [**Political and Social
Writings**, vol. 2, p. 107]

This is why anarchists desire to abolish "work" (i.e., productive
activity not under control of the people doing it), to ensure that
whatever productive economic activity is required to be done is managed
by those who do it. In this way it can be liberated, transformed, and so
become a means of self-realisation and not a form of self-negation. In
other words, anarchists want to abolish work because *"[l]ife, the art
of living, has become a dull formula, flat and inert."* [Berkman, **Op.
Cit.**, p. 166] Anarchists want to bring the spontaneity and joy of life
back into productive activity and save humanity from the dead hand of
capital. Anarchists consider economic activity as an expression of the
human spirit, an expression of the innate human need to express
ourselves and to create. Capitalism distorts these needs and makes
economic activity a deadening experience by the division of labour and
hierarchy. We think that *"industry is not an end in itself, but should
only be a means to ensure to man his material subsistence and to make
accessible to him the blessings of a higher intellectual culture. Where
industry is everything and man is nothing begins the realm of a ruthless
economic despotism whose workings are no less disastrous than those of
any political despotism. The two mutually augment one another, and they
are fed from the same source."* [Rudolph Rocker,
**Anarcho-Syndicalism**, p. 2]

One last point on the abolition of work. May 1st -- International
Workers' Day -- was, as we discussed in [section
A.5.2](secA5.html#seca52), created to commemorate the Chicago Anarchist
Martyrs. Anarchists then, as now, think that it should be celebrated by
strike action and mass demonstrations. In other words, for anarchists,
International Workers' Day should be a non-work day! That sums up the
anarchist position to work nicely -- that the celebration of workers'
day should be based on the rejection of work.

The collection of articles in **Why Work? Arguments for the Leisure
Society** (edited by Vernon Richards) is a useful starting place for
libertarian socialist perspectives on work.

I.4.3 How do anarchists intend to abolish work?
-----------------------------------------------

Basically by workers' self-management of production and common ownership
of the means of production. It is hardly in the interests of those who
do the actual "work" to have bad working conditions, boring, repetitive
labour, and so on. Therefore, a key aspect of the liberation from work
is to create a self-managed society, *"a society in which everyone has
equal means to develop and that all are or can be at the same time
intellectual and manual workers, and the only differences remaining
between men [and women] are those which stem from the natural diversity
of aptitudes, and that all jobs, all functions, give an equal right to
the enjoyment of social possibilities."* [Errico Malatesta, **Anarchy**,
p. 42]

Essential to this task is decentralisation and the use of appropriate
technology. Decentralisation is important to ensure that those who do
work can determine how to liberate it. A decentralised system will
ensure that ordinary people can identify areas for technological
innovation and so understand the need to get rid of certain kinds of
work. Unless ordinary people understand and control the introduction of
technology, then they will never be fully aware of the benefits of
technology and resist advances which may be in their best interests to
introduce. This is the full meaning of appropriate technology, namely
the use of technology which those most affected feel to be best in a
given situation. Such technology may or may not be technologically
"advanced" but it will be of the kind which ordinary people can
understand and, most importantly, control.

The potential for rational use of technology can be seen from
capitalism. Under capitalism, technology is used to increase profits, to
expand the economy, not to liberate **all** individuals from useless
toil (it does, of course, liberate a few from such "activity"). As
economist Juliet B. Schor points out, productivity *"measures the goods
and services that result from each hour worked. When productivity rises,
a worker can either produce the current output in less time, or remain
at work the same number of hours and produce more."* With rising
productivity, we are presented with the possibility of more free time.
For example, since 1948 the level of productivity of the American worker
*"has more than doubled. In other words, we could now produce our 1948
standard of living . . . . in less than half the time it took that year.
We could actually have chosen the four-hour day. Or a working year of
six months."* [**The Overworked American**, p. 2]

And, remember, these figures include production in many areas of the
economy that would not exist in a free society -- state and capitalist
bureaucracy, weapons production for the military, property defence, the
finance sector, and so on. As Alexander Berkman argued, millions are
*"engaged in trade, . . . advertisers, and various other middlemen of
the present system"* along with the armed forces and *"the great numbers
employed in unnecessary and harmful occupations, such as building
warships, the manufacture of ammunition and other military equipment"*
would be *"released for useful work by a revolution."* [**What is
Anarchism**, pp. 224-5] So the working week will be reduced simply
because more people will be available for doing essential work.
Moreover, goods will be built to last and so much production will become
sensible and not governed by an insane desire to maximise profits at the
expense of everything else. In addition, this is not taking into account
the impact of a more just distribution of consumption in terms of living
standards and production, meaning that a standard of living produced by
working half the time would be far higher than that implied by Schor's
1948 baseline (not to mention the advances in technology since then
either!). In short, do not take the 1948 date as implying a literal
return to that period!

Moreover, a lower working week would see productivity rising. *"Thus,"*
as one economist summarises, *"when the hours of labour were reduced,
the better-rested workers were often able to produce as much or more in
the shorter hours than they had previously in longer hours."* Yet
*"competition between employers would make it unlikely that a working
day of optimal length would be established"* under capitalism. In
addition, *"more disposable time might better contribute to people's
well-being -- that is, to things such as trust, health, learning, family
life, self-reliance and citizenship"*. While this may reduce such
conventional economic measures as GDP, the fact is that such measures
are flawed. After all, *"an increase in GDP could represent a diminution
of free time accompanied by an increased output of goods and services
whose sole utility was either facilitating labour-market participation
or repairing some of the social damage that resulted from the stress of
overwork or neglect of non-market activity."* [Tom Walker, *"Why
Economists dislike a Lump of Labor"*, pp. 279-91, **Review of Social
Economy**, vol. 65, No. 3, p. 286, pp. 287-8 and p. 288]

All this suggests the level of production for useful goods with a
four-hour working day would be much higher than the 1948 level or, of
course, the working day could be made even shorter. As such, we can
easily combine a decent standard of living with a significant reduction
of the necessary working time required to produce it. Once we realise
that much work under capitalism exists to manage aspects of the profit
system or are produced as a result of that system and the damage it
does, we can see how a self-managed society can give us more time for
ourselves in addition to producing useful goods (rather than working
long and hard to produce surplus value for the few).

However, anarchists do not see it as simply a case of reducing the hours
of work will keeping the remaining work as it. That would be silly. We
aim to transform what useful productive activity is left. When
self-management becomes universal we will see the end of division of
labour as mental and physical work becomes unified and those who do the
work also manage it. This will allow *"the free exercise of **all** the
faculties of man"* both inside and outside "work." [Peter Kropotkin,
**The Conquest of Bread**, p. 148] The aim of such a development would
be to turn productive activity, as far as possible, into an enjoyable
experience. In the words of Murray Bookchin it is the **quality** and
**nature** of the work process that counts:

> *"If workers' councils and workers' management of production do not
> transform the work into a joyful activity, free time into a marvellous
> experience, and the workplace into a community, then they remain
> merely formal structures, in fact, **class** structures. They
> perpetuate the limitations of the proletariat as a product of
> bourgeois social conditions. Indeed, no movement that raises the
> demand for workers' councils can be regarded as revolutionary unless
> it tries to promote sweeping transformations in the environment of the
> work place."* [**Post-Scarcity Anarchism**, p. 88]

Work will become, primarily, the expression of a person's pleasure in
what they are doing and become like an art -- an expression of their
creativity and individuality. Work as an art will become expressed in
the workplace as well as the work process, with workplaces transformed
and integrated into the local community and environment (see [section
I.4.15](secI4.html#seci415)). This will obviously apply to work
conducted in the home as well, otherwise the *"revolution, intoxicated
with the beautiful words, Liberty, Equality, Solidarity, would not be a
revolution if it maintained slavery at home. Half [of] humanity
subjected to the slavery of the hearth would still have to rebel against
the other half."* [Kropotkin, **Op. Cit.**, p. 128]

In other words, anarchists desire *"to combine the best part (in fact,
the only good part) of work -- the production of use-values -- with the
best of play . . . its freedom and its fun, its voluntariness and its
intrinsic gratification"*. In short, the transformation of production
(creating *"what seems needful"*") into *"**productive play***". [Bob
Black, *"Smokestack Lightning"*, **Friendly Fire**, p. 48 and p. 49]

Workers' self-management of production (see [section
I.3.2](secI3.html#seci32)) would be the means of achieving this. Only
those subject to a specific mode of working can be in a position to
transform it and their workplace into something fit for free individuals
to create in. Only those who know a workplace which would only exist in
a hierarchical system like capitalism can be in a position to
decommission it safely and quickly. The very basis of free association
will ensure the abolition of work, as individuals will apply for "work"
they enjoy doing and so would be interested in reducing "work" they did
not want to do to a minimum. Therefore, an anarchist society would
abolish work by ensuring that those who do it actually control it.
*"Personal initiative will be encouraged and every tendency to
uniformity and centralisation combated."* [Kropotkin, quoted by Martin
Buber, **Paths in Utopia**, p. 42]

All this does not imply that anarchists think that individuals will not
seek to "specialise" in one form of productive activity rather than
another. Far from it, people in a free society will pick activities
which interest them as the main focal point of their means of
self-expression (after all, not everyone enjoys the same games and
pastimes so why expect the same of productive play?). *"It is evident,"*
noted Kropotkin, *"that all men and women cannot equally enjoy the
pursuit of scientific work. The variety of inclinations is such that
some will find more pleasure in science, some others in art, and others
again in some of the numberless branches of the production of wealth."*
This "division of work" is commonplace in humanity this natural desire
to do what interests you and what you are good at will be encouraged in
an anarchist society. As Kropotkin argued, anarchists *"fully recognise
the necessity of specialisation of knowledge, but we maintain that
specialisation must follow general education, and that general education
must be given in science and handicraft alike. To the division of
society into brain workers and manual workers we oppose the combination
of both kinds of activities . . . we advocate the **education
integrale** [integral education], or complete education, which means the
disappearance of that pernicious division."* Anarchists are, needless to
say, aware that training and study are required to qualify you to so
some tasks and a free society would ensure that individuals would
achieve the necessary recognised levels before undertaking them (by
means of, say, professional bodies who organise a certification
process). Kropotkin was aware, however, that both individuals and
society would benefit from a diversity of activities and a strong
general knowledge: *"But whatever the occupations preferred by everyone,
everyone will be the more useful in his [or her] branch if he [or she]
is in possession of a serious scientific knowledge. And, whosoever he
might be . . . he would be the gainer if he spent a part of his life in
the workshop or the farm (the workshop **and** the farm), if he were in
contact with humanity in its daily work, and had the satisfaction of
knowing that he himself discharges his duties as an unprivileged
producer of wealth."* [**Fields, Factories and Workshops Tomorrow**, p.
186, p. 172 and p. 186]

However, while specialisation would continue, the permanent division of
individuals into manual or brain workers would be eliminated.
Individuals will manage all aspects of the "work" required (for example,
engineers will also take part in self-managing their workplaces), a
variety of activities would be encouraged and the strict division of
labour of capitalism will be abolished. In other words, anarchists want
to replace the division of labour by the division of work. We must
stress that we are not playing with words here. John Crump presents a
good summary of the ideas of the Japanese anarchist Hatta Shuzo on this
difference:

> *"[We must] recognise the distinction which Hatta made between the
> 'division of labour' . . . and the 'division of work' . . . while
> Hatta believed that the division of labour . . . was the cause of
> class divisions and exploitation, he did not see anything sinister in
> the division of work . . . On the contrary, Hatta believed that the
> division of work was a benign and unavoidable feature of any
> productive process: 'it goes without saying that within society,
> whatever the kind of production, there has to be a division of work.'
> . . . [For] the dangers [of division of labour] to which Hatta [like
> other anarchists like Proudhon and Kropotkin] drew attention did not
> arise from a situation where, at any one time, different people were
> engaged in different productive activities . . . What did spell
> danger, however, was when, either individually or collectively, people
> permanently divided along occupational lines . . . and gave rise to

> or interest in other branches of production; and the need for a
> superior administrative organ to co-ordinate the various branches of
> production."* [**Hatta Shuzo and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan**,
> pp. 146-7]

As Kropotkin argued:

> *"while a **temporary** division of functions remains the surest
> guarantee of success in each separate undertaking, the **permanent**
> division is doomed to disappear, and to be substituted by a variety of
> pursuits -- intellectual, industrial, and agricultural --
> corresponding to the different capacities of the individual, as well
> as to the variety of capacities within every human aggregate."* [**Op.
> Cit.**, p. 26]

As an aside, supporters of capitalism argue that **integrated** labour
must be more inefficient than **divided** labour as capitalist firms
have not introduced it. This is false for numerous reasons.

Firstly, we have to put out the inhuman logic of the assertion. After
all, few would argue in favour of slavery if it were, in fact, **more**
productive than wage labour but such is the logical conclusion of this
argument. If someone did argue that the only reason slavery was not the
dominant mode of labour simply because it was inefficient we would
consider them as less than human. Simply put, it is a sick ideology
which happily sacrifices individuals for the sake of slightly more
products. Sadly, that is what many defenders of capitalism do,
ultimately, argue for.

Secondly, capitalist firms are not neutral structures but rather a
system of hierarchies, with entrenched interests and needs. Managers
will only introduce a work technique that maintains their power (and so
their profits). As we argue in [section J.5.12](secJ5.html#secj512),
while experiments in workers' participation see a rise in efficiency and
productivity, managers stop them simply because they recognise that
workers' control undercuts their power by empowering workers who then
can fight for a greater slice of the value they produce (not to mention
come to the conclusion that while the boss needs them to work, they
don't need to boss to manage them!). So the lack of integrated labour
under capitalism simply means that it does not empower management nor
secure their profits and power, **not** that it is less efficient.

Thirdly, the attempts by managers and bosses to introduce "flexibility"
by eliminating unions suggests that integration **is** more efficient.
After all, one of the major complains directed towards union contracts
are that they explicitly documented what workers could and could not do
(for example, union members would refuse to do work which was outside
their agreed job descriptions). This is usually classed as an example of
the evil of regulations. However, if we look at it from the viewpoint of
contract and division of labour, it exposes the inefficiency and
inflexibility of both as a means of co-operation. After all, what is
this refusal actually mean? It means that the worker refuses to do work
that is not specified in his or her contract! Their job description
indicates what they have been contracted to do and anything else has not
been agreed upon in advance. The contract specifies a clear, specified
and agreed division of labour in a workplace between worker and boss.

While being a wonderful example of a well-designed contract, managers
discovered that they could not operate their workplaces because of them.
Rather, they needed a general "do what you are told" contract (which of
course is hardly an example of contract reducing authority) and such a
contract **integrates** numerous work tasks into one. The managers
diatribe against union contracts suggests that production needs some
form of integrated labour to actually work (as well as showing the
hypocrisy of the labour contract under capitalism as labour
"flexibility" simply means labour "commodification" -- a machine does
not question what its used for, the ideal under capitalism is a similar
unquestioning nature for labour). The union job description indicates
that production needs the integration of labour while demanding a
division of work. As Cornelius Castoriadis argued:

> *"Modern production has destroyed many traditional professional
> qualifications. It has created automatic or semi-automatic machines.
> It has thereby itself demolished its own traditional framework for the
> industrial division of labour. It has given birth to a universal
> worker who is capable, after a relatively short apprenticeship, of
> using most machines. Once one gets beyond its class aspects, the
> 'posting' of workers to particular jobs in a big modern factory
> corresponds less and less to a genuine division of **labour** and more
> and more to a simple division of tasks. Workers are not allocated to
> given areas of the productive process and then riveted to them because
> their 'occupational skills' invariably correspond to the 'skills
> required' by management. They are placed there . . . just because a
> particular vacancy happened to exist."* [**Political and Economic
> Writings**, vol. 2, p. 117]

By replacing the division of labour with the division of work, a free
society will ensure that productive activity can be transformed into an
enjoyable task (or series of tasks). By integrating labour, all the
capacities of the producer can be expressed so eliminating a major
source of alienation and unhappiness in society. *"The main subject of
social economy,"* argued Kropotkin, is *"the **economy** of energy
required for the satisfaction of **human needs.**"* These needs
obviously expressed both the needs of the producers for empowering and
interesting work and their need for a healthy and balanced environment.
Thus Kropotkin discussed the *"advantages"* which could be *"derive[d]
from a combination of industrial pursuits with intensive agriculture,
and of brain work with manual work."* The *"greatest sum total of
well-being can be obtained when a variety of agricultural, industrial
and intellectual pursuits are combined in each community; and that man
[and woman] shows his best when he is in a position to apply his
usually-varied capacities to several pursuits in the farm, the workshop,
the factory, the study or the studio, instead of being riveted for life
to one of these pursuits only."* [**Op. Cit.**, pp. 17-8] This means
that *"[u]nder socialism, factories would have no reason to accept the
artificially rigid division of labour now prevailing. There will be
every reason to encourage a rotation of workers **between shops and
departments** and between production and office areas."* The *"residues
of capitalism's division of labour gradually will have to be
eliminated"* as *"socialist society cannot survive unless it demolishes
this division."* [Castoriadis, **Op. Cit.**, p. 117]

Anarchists think that a decentralised social system will allow "work" to
be abolished and economic activity humanised and made a means to an end
(namely producing useful things and liberated individuals). This would
be achieved by, as Rudolf Rocker puts it, the *"alliance of free groups
of men and women based on co-operative labour and a planned
administration of things in the interest of the community."* However, as
things are produced by people, it could be suggested that this implies a
*"planned administration of people"* (although few who suggest this
danger apply it to capitalist firms which are like mini-centrally
planned states). This objection is false simply because anarchism aims
*"to reconstruct the economic life of the peoples from the ground up and
build it up anew in the spirit of Socialism"* and, moreover, *"only the
producers themselves are fitted for this task, since they are the only
value-creating element in society out of which a new future can arise."*
Such a reconstructed economic life would be based on anarchist
principles, that is *"based on the principles of federalism, a free
combination from below upwards, putting the right of self-determination
of every member above everything else and recognising only the organic
agreement of all on the basis of like interests and common
convictions."* [**Anarcho-Syndicalism**, p. 72, p. 62 and p. 60]

In other words, those who produce also administer and so govern
themselves in free association (and it should be pointed out that any
group of individuals in association will make "plans" and "plan", the
important question is who does the planning and who does the work. Only
in anarchy are both functions united into the same people). The
*"planned administration of things"* would be done by the producers
**themselves,** in their independent groupings. This would likely take
the form (as we indicated in [section I.3](secI3.html)) of
confederations of syndicates who communicate information between
themselves and respond to changes in the production and distribution of
products by increasing or decreasing the required means of production in
a co-operative (i.e. *"planned"*) fashion. No "central planning" or
"central planners" governing the economy, just workers co-operating
together as equals (as Kropotkin argued, free socialism *"must result
from thousands of separate local actions, all directed towards the same
aim. It cannot be dictated by a central body: it must result from the
numberless local needs and wants."* [**Act for Yourselves**, p. 54]).

Now, any form of association requires agreement. Therefore, even a
society based on the communist-anarchist maxim *"from each according to
their ability, to each according to their need"* will need to make
agreements in order to ensure co-operative ventures succeed. In other
words, members of a co-operative commonwealth would have to make and
keep to their agreements between themselves. This means that the members
of a syndicate would agree joint starting and finishing times, require
notice if individuals want to change "jobs" and so on within and between
syndicates. Any joint effort requires some degree of co-operation and
agreement. Moreover, between syndicates, an agreement would be reached
(in all likelihood) that determined the minimum working hours required
by all members of society able to work. As Kropotkin argued, an
communist anarchist society would be based upon the such a minimum-hour
*"contract"* between its members:

> *"We undertake to give you the use of our houses, stores, streets,
> means of transport, schools, museums, etc., on condition that, from
> twenty to forty-five or fifty years of age, you consecrate four or
> five hours a day to some work recognised as necessary to existence.
> Choose yourself the producing group which you wish to join, or
> organise a new group, provided that it will undertake to produce
> necessaries. And as for the remainder of your time, combine together
> with whomsoever you like, for recreation, art, or science, according
> to the bent of your taste . . . Twelve or fifteen hundred hours of
> work a year . . . is all we ask of you. For that amount of work we
> guarantee to you the free use of all that these groups produce, or
> will produce."* [**The Conquest of Bread**, pp. 153-4]

With such work *"necessary to existence"* being recognised by
individuals and expressed by demand for labour from productive
syndicates. It is, of course, up to the individual to decide which work
he or she desires to perform from the positions available in the various
associations in existence. A union card could be the means by which work
hours would be recorded and access to the common wealth of society
ensured. And, of course, individuals and groups are free to work alone
and exchange the produce of their labour with others, including the
confederated syndicates, if they so desired. An anarchist society will
be as flexible as possible.

Therefore, we can imagine a social anarchist society being based on two
basic arrangements -- firstly, an agreed minimum working week of, say,
16 hours, in a syndicate of your choice, plus any amount of hours doing
"work" which you feel like doing -- for example, art, scientific
experimentation, DIY, playing music, composing, gardening and so on. How
that minimum working week was actually organised would vary between
workplace and commune, with work times, flexi-time, job rotation and so
on determined by each syndicate (for example, one syndicate may work 8
hours a day for 2 days, another 4 hours a day for 4 days, one may use
flexi-time, another more rigid starting and stopping times). Needless to
say, in response to consumption patterns, syndicates will have to expand
or reduce production and will have to attract volunteers to do the
necessary work as would syndicates whose work was considered dangerous
or unwanted. In such circumstances, volunteers could arrange doing a few
hours of such activity for more free time or it could be agreed that one
hour of such unwanted positions equals more hours in a more desired one
(see [section I.4.13](secI4.html#seci413) for more on this). Needless to
say, the aim of technological progress would be to eliminate unpleasant
and unwanted tasks and to reduce the basic working week more and more
until the very concept of necessary "work" and free time enjoyments is
abolished. Anarchists are convinced that the decentralisation of power
within a free society would unleash a wealth of innovation and ensure
that unpleasant tasks are minimised and fairly shared while required
productive activity is made as pleasant and enjoyable as possible.

It could be said that this sort of agreement is a restriction of liberty
because it is "man-made" (as opposed to the "natural law" of "supply and
demand"). This is a common defence of the non-capitalist market by
individualist anarchists against anarcho-communism, for example.
However, while in theory individualist-anarchists can claim that in
their vision of society, they don't care when, where, or how a person
earns a living, as long as they are not invasive about it the fact is
that any economy is based on interactions between individuals. The law
of "supply and demand" easily, and often, makes a mockery of the ideas
that individuals can work as long as they like - usually they end up
working as long as required by market forces (i.e. the actions of other
individuals, but turned into a force outwith their control, see [section
I.1.3](secI1.html#seci13)). This means that individuals do not work as
long as they like, but as long as they have to in order to survive.
Knowing that "market forces" is the cause of long hours of work hardly
makes them any nicer.

And it seems strange to the communist-anarchist that certain free
agreements made between equals can be considered authoritarian while
others are not. The individualist-anarchist argument that social
co-operation to reduce labour is "authoritarian" while agreements
between individuals on the market are not seems illogical to social
anarchists. They cannot see how it is better for individuals to be
pressured into working longer than they desire by "invisible hands" than
to come to an arrangement with others to manage their own affairs to
maximise their free time.

Therefore, free agreement between free and equal individuals is
considered the key to abolishing work, based upon decentralisation of
power and the use of appropriate technology.

I.4.4 What economic decision making criteria could be used in anarchy?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Firstly, it should be noted that anarchists do not have any set idea
about the answer to this question. Most anarchists are communists,
desiring to see the end of money, but that does not mean they want to
impose communism onto people. Far from it, communism can only be truly
libertarian if it is organised from the bottom up. So, anarchists would
agree with Kropotkin that it is a case of not *"determining in advance
what form of distribution the producers should accept in their different
groups -- whether the communist solution, or labour checks, or equal
salaries, or any other method"* while considering a given solution best
in their opinion. [**Anarchism**, p. 166] Free experimentation is a key
aspect of anarchism.

While certain anarchists have certain preferences on the social system
they want to live in and so argue for that, they are aware that
objective circumstances and social desires will determine what is
introduced during a revolution (for example, while Kropotkin was a
communist-anarchist and considered it essential that a revolution
proceed towards communism as quickly as possible, he was aware that it
was unlikely it would be introduced fully immediately -- see [section
I.2.2](secI2.html#seci22) for details). However, we will outline some
possible means of economic decision making criteria as this question is
an important one and so we will indicate what possible solutions exist
in different forms of anarchism.

In a mutualist or collectivist system, the answer is easy. Prices will
exist and be used as a means of making decisions (although, as Malatesta
suggested, such non-communist anarchies would *"seek a way to ensure
that money truly represents the useful work performed by its
possessors"* rather than, as today, *"the means for living on the labour
of others"* [**Errico Malatesta: His Life and Ideas**, p. 101 and p.
100]). Mutualism will be more market orientated than collectivism, with
collectivism being based on confederations of collectives to respond to
changes in demand (i.e. to determine investment decisions and ensure
that supply is kept in line with demand). Mutualism, with its system of
market based distribution around a network of co-operatives and mutual
banks, does not really need a further discussion as its basic operations
are the same as in any non-capitalist market system. Collectivism and
communism will have to be discussed in more detail. However, all systems
are based on workers' self-management and so the individuals directly
affected make the decisions concerning what to produce, when to do it,
and how to do it. In this way workers retain control of the product of
their labour. It is the social context of these decisions and what
criteria workers use to make their decisions that differ between
anarchist schools of thought.

Although collectivism promotes the greatest autonomy for worker
associations, it should not be confused with a market economy as
advocated by supporters of mutualism or Individualist anarchism. The
goods produced by the collectivised factories and workshops are
exchanged not according to highest price that can be wrung from
consumers, but according to their actual production costs. The
determination of these honest prices would be made by a *"Bank of
Exchange"* in each community (obviously an idea borrowed from Proudhon).
These Banks would represent the various producer confederations and
consumer/citizen groups in the community and would seek to negotiate
these "honest" prices (which would, in all likelihood, include "hidden"
costs like pollution). These agreements would be subject to ratification
by the assemblies of those involved.

As James Guillaume put it *"the value of the commodities having been
established in advance by a contractual agreement between the regional
co-operative federations and the various communes, who will also furnish
statistics to the Banks of Exchange. The Bank of Exchange will remit to
the producers negotiable vouchers representing the value of their
products; these vouchers will be accepted throughout the territory
included in the federation of communes."* These vouchers would be
related to hours worked, for example, and when used as a guide for
investment decisions could be supplemented with cost-benefit analysis of
the kind possibly used in a communist-anarchist society (see below).
Although this scheme bears a strong resemblance to Proudhonian
*"People's Banks,"* it should be noted that the Banks of Exchange, along
with a *"Communal Statistical Commission,"* are intended to have a
planning function as well to ensure that supply meets demand. This does
not imply a Stalinist-like command economy, but simple book keeping for
*"each Bank of Exchange makes sure in advance that these products are in
demand [in order to risk] nothing by immediately issuing payment
vouchers to the producers."* [*"On Building the New Social Order"*, pp.
356-79, **Bakunin on Anarchism**, p. 366 and p. 367] The workers
syndicates would still determine what orders to produce and each commune
would be free to choose its suppliers.

As will be discussed in more depth later (see [section
I.4.8](secI4.html#seci48)) information about consumption patterns will
be recorded and used by workers to inform their production and
investment decisions. In addition, we can imagine that production
syndicates would encourage communes as well as consumer groups and
co-operatives to participate in making these decisions. This would
ensure that produced goods reflect consumer needs. Moreover, as
conditions permit, the exchange functions of the communal "banks" would
(in all likelihood) be gradually replaced by the distribution of goods
in accordance with the needs of the consumers. In other words, most
supporters of collectivist anarchism see it as a temporary measure
before anarcho-communism could develop.

Communist anarchism would be similar to collectivism, i.e. a system of
confederations of collectives, communes and distribution centres
(Communal stores). However, in an anarcho-communist system, prices are
not used. How will economic decision making be done? One possible
solution is as follows:

> *"As to decisions involving choices of a general nature, such as what
> forms of energy to use, which of two or more materials to employ to
> produce a particular good, whether to build a new factory, there is a
> . . . technique . . . that could be [used] . . . 'cost-benefit

> simply to employ a technique to facilitate decision-making in
> particular concrete cases."* [Adam Buick and John Crump, **State
> Capitalism: The Wages System Under New Management**, pp. 138-139]

This points system would be the means by which producers and consumers
would be able to determine whether the use of a particular good is
efficient or not. Unlike prices, this cost-benefit analysis system would
ensure that production and consumption reflects social and ecological
costs, awareness and priorities. Moreover, this analysis would be a
**guide** to decision making and not a replacement of human decision
making and evaluation. As Lewis Mumford argued:

> *"it is plain that in the decision as to whether to build a bridge or

Obviously, today, we would include ecological issues as well as human
ones. Any decision making process which disregards the quality of work
or the effect on the human and natural environment is a deranged one.
However, this is how capitalism operates, with the market rewarding
capitalists and managers who introduce de-humanising and ecologically
harmful practices. Indeed, so biased against labour and the environment
is capitalism that many economists and pro-capitalists argue that
reducing "efficiency" by such social concerns (as expressed by the
passing laws related to labour rights and environmental protection) is
actually **harmful** to an economy, which is a total reversal of common
sense and human feelings (after all, surely the economy should satisfy
human needs and not sacrifice those needs to the economy?). The argument
is that consumption would suffer as resources (human and material) would
be diverted from more "efficient" productive activities and so reduce,
over all, our economic well-being. What this argument ignores is that
consumption does not exist in isolation from the rest of the economy.
What we want to consume is conditioned, in part, by the sort of person
we are and that is influenced by the kind of work we do, the kinds of
social relationships we have, whether we are happy with our work and
life, and so on. If our work is alienating and of low quality, then so
will our consumption decisions. If our work is subject to hierarchical
control and servile in nature then we cannot expect our consumption
decisions to be totally rational -- indeed they may become an attempt to
find happiness via shopping, a self-defeating activity as consumption
cannot solve a problem created in production. Thus rampant consumerism
may be the result of capitalist "efficiency" and so the objection
against socially aware production is question begging.

Of course, as well as absolute scarcity, prices under capitalism also
reflect relative scarcity (while in the long term, market prices tend
towards their production price plus a mark-up based on the degree of
monopoly in a market, in the short term prices can change as a result of
changes in supply and demand). How a communist society could take into
account such short term changes and communicate them through out the
economy is discussed in [section I.4.5](secI4.html#seci45). Moreover, it
is likely that they will factor in the desirability of the work
performed to indicate the potential waste in human time involved in
production (see [section I.4.13](secI4.html#seci413) for a discussion of
how this could be done). The logic behind this is simple, a resource
which people **like** to produce will be a better use of the scare
resource of an individual's time than one people hate producing. Another
key factor in making sensible decisions would be the relative scarcity
of a good. After all, it would make little sense when making a decision
to use a good which is in short supply over one which is much more
abundant. Thus, while the cost-benefit points system would show absolute
costs (number of hours work required, energy use, pollution, etc.) this
would be complemented by information about how scare a specific good is
and the desirability of the work required to produce it.

Therefore, a communist-anarchist society would be based around a network
of syndicates who communicate information between each other. Instead of
the price being communicated between workplaces as in capitalism, actual
physical data will be sent (the cost). This data is a summary of these
(negative) use values of the good (for example resources, labour time
and energy used to produce it, pollution details) as well as relative
scarcity. With this information a cost-benefit analysis will be
conducted to determine which good will be best to use in a given
situation based upon mutually agreed common values. These will be used
to inform the decision on which goods to use, with how well goods meet
the requirements of production (the positive use-value) being compared
to their impact in terms of labour, resource use, pollution and so forth
(the negative use-values) along with their relative availability.

The data for a given workplace could be compared to the industry as a
whole (as confederations of syndicates would gather and produce such
information -- see [section I.3.5](secI3.html#seci35)) in order to
determine whether a specific workplace will efficiently produce the
required goods (this system has the additional advantage of indicating
which workplaces require investment to bring them in line, or improve
upon, the industrial average in terms of working conditions, hours
worked and so on). In addition, common rules of thumb would possibly be
agreed, such as agreements not to use scarce materials unless there is
no alternative (either ones that use a lot of labour, energy and time to
produce or those whose demand is currently exceeding supply capacity).

Similarly, when ordering goods, the syndicate, commune or individual
involved will have to inform the syndicate why it is required in order
to allow the syndicate to determine if they desire to produce the good
and to enable them to prioritise the orders they receive. In this way,
resource use can be guided by social considerations and "unreasonable"
requests ignored (for example, if an individual states they "need" a
ship-builders syndicate to build a ship for their personal use, the
ship-builders may not "need" to build it and instead build ships for
communal use, freely available for all to use in turn -- see [section
I.4.6](secI4.html#seci46)). However, in almost all cases of individual
consumption, no such information will be needed as communal stores would
order consumer goods in bulk as they do now. Hence the economy would be
a vast network of co-operating individuals and workplaces and the
dispersed knowledge which exists within any society can be put to good
effect (**better** effect than under capitalism because it does not hide
social and ecological costs in the way market prices do and co-operation
will eliminate the business cycle and its resulting social problems).

Therefore, production units in a social anarchist society, by virtue of
their autonomy within association, are aware of what is socially useful
for them to produce and, by virtue of their links with communes, also
aware of the social (human and ecological) cost of the resources they
need to produce it. They can combine this knowledge, reflecting overall
social priorities, with their local knowledge of the detailed
circumstances of their workplaces and communities to decide how they can
best use their productive capacity. In this way the division of
knowledge within society can be used by the syndicates effectively as
well as overcoming the restrictions within knowledge communication
imposed by the price mechanism (see [section I.1.2](secI1.html#seci12))
and workplaces hierarchies within capitalism (see [section
I.1.1](secI1.html#seci11)).

Moreover, production units, by their association within confederations
ensure that there is effective communication between them. This results
in a process of negotiated co-ordination between equals (i.e. horizontal
links and agreements) for major investment decisions, thus bringing
together supply and demand and allowing the plans of the various units
to be co-ordinated. By this process of co-operation, production units
can reduce duplicating effort and so reduce the waste associated with
over-investment (and so the irrationalities of booms and slumps
associated with the price mechanism, which does not provide sufficient
information to allow workplaces to efficiently co-ordinate their plans).

When evaluating production methods we need to take into account as many
social and ecological costs as possible and these have to be evaluated.
Which costs will be taken into account, of course, be decided by those
involved, as will how important they are relative to each other (i.e.
how they are weighted). What factors to take into account and how to
weigh them in the decision making process will be evaluated and reviewed
regularly so to ensure that it reflects real costs and social concerns.
As communist-anarchists consider it important to encourage all to
participate in the decisions that affect their lives, it would be the
role of communal confederations to determine the relative points value
of given inputs and outputs. In this way, **all** individuals in a
community determine how their society develops, so ensuring that
economic activity is responsible to social needs and takes into account
the desires of everyone affected by production. In this way consumption
and production can be harmonised with the needs of individuals as
members of society and the environment they live in. The industrial
confederations would seek to ensure that this information is recorded
and communicated and (perhaps) formulating industry-wide averages to aid
decision-making by allowing syndicates and communes to compare specific
goods points to the typical value.

So which factors are to be used to inform decision-making would be
agreed and the information communicated between workplaces and communes
so that consumers of goods can evaluate their costs in terms of
ecological impact, use of resources and human labour. Any agreed values
for the Cost-Benefit analysis for inputs can be incorporated in the
information associated with the outputs. As such, a communist society
would seek to base decisions on more than one criteria, whether it is
profits or (say) labour. The reasons for this should be obvious, as one
criteria rarely allows sensible decisions. Of course, to some degree
people already do this under capitalism but market forces and inequality
limit this ability (people will tend to buy cheaper products if they
need to make ends meet) while both the price mechanism and the
self-interest of companies ensure information about costs are hidden
(for example, few companies publically acknowledge their externalities
and most spend vast sums on advertising to greenwash their products).

In order to process the information on costs communicated in a
libertarian communist economy accounting tools can be created (such as a
spreadsheet or computer programme). These could take the decided factors
as inputs and returns a cost benefit analysis of the choices available.
So while these algorithmic procedures and guidelines can, and indeed
should be, able to be calculated by hand, it is likely that computers
will be extensively used to take input data and process it into a
suitable format. Indeed, many capitalist companies have software which
records raw material inputs and finished product into databases and
spreadsheets. Such software could be the basis of a libertarian
communist decision making algorithm. Of course, currently such data is
submerged beneath money and does not take into account externalities and
the nature of the work involved (as would be the case in an anarchist
society). However, this does not limit their potential or deny that
communist use of such software can be used to inform decisions.

Therefore, the claim that communism cannot evaluate different production
methods due to lack of prices is inaccurate. Indeed, a look at the
actual capitalist market -- marked as it is by differences in bargaining
and market power, externalities and wage labour -- soon shows that the
claims that prices accurately reflect costs is simply not accurate.
However, it may be such that objective circumstances preclude the
immediate introduction of libertarian communism (as discussed in
[section I.2.2](secI2.html#seci22), many communist anarchists consider
this likely). As such, there could be a transitional period in which
elements of mutualism, collectivism and communism co-exist within a
specific economy. It can easily be seen how a mutualist economy (the
usual initial product of a social revolution) could evolve into a
collectivist and then communist one. The market generated prices could
initially be complemented by the non-market information decided upon
(for objective costs and the scarcity index) and, overtime, replaced by
this data as the main decision making criteria by syndicates and
communes.

One final point on this subject. What methods are used, which criteria
picked, which information is communicated and how it is processed, will
be the decision of a free people. This section was merely a suggestion
of one possibility of how a libertarian communist economy could make
informed decisions about production. It is not meant as a blue-print nor
is it set-in-stone.

I.4.5 What about *"supply and demand"*?
---------------------------------------

Anarchists do not ignore the facts of life, namely that at a given
moment there is so much a certain good produced and so much of it is
desired to be consumed or used. Neither do we deny that different
individuals have different interests and tastes. However, this is not
what is usually meant by *"supply and demand."* Often in general
economic debate, this formula is given a certain mythical quality which
ignores its underlying realities as well as some unwholesome
implications of the theory (for example, as discussed in [section
C.1.5](secC1.html#secc15) the market can very efficiently create famines
by exporting food to areas where there is demand for it). At the very
least, the *"the law of supply and demand"* is not the "most efficient"
means of distribution in an unequal society as decisions are skewed in
favour of the rich.

As far as *"supply and demand"* in terms of allocating scare resources
is concerned, anarchists are well aware of the need to create and
distribute necessary goods to those who require them. The question is,
in an anarchist society, how do you know that valuable labour and
materials are not being wasted? How do people judge which tools are most
appropriate? How do they decide among different materials if they all
meet the technical specifications? How important are some goods than
others? How important is cellophane compared to vacuum-cleaner bags and
so which one should be produced?

It is answers like this that the supporters of the market claim that
their system answers. For individualist and mutualist anarchists, their
non-capitalist market would indicate such information by differences
between market price and cost price and individuals and co-operatives
would react accordingly. For communist and collectivist anarchists, who
reject even non-capitalist markets, the answer is less simple. As
discussed in [section I.1.3](secI1.html#seci13), these anarchists argue
that although the market does answer such questions it does so in
irrational and dehumanising ways (while this is particularly the case
under capitalism, it cannot be assumed this will disappear in a
post-capitalist market). The question is: can collectivist and communist
anarchism answer such questions? Yes, they reply.

So collectivist and communist anarchists reject the market. This
rejection often implies, to some, central planning. As the market
socialist David Schweickart puts it, *"[i]f profit considerations do not
dictate resource usage and production techniques, then central direction
must do so. If profit is not the goal of a productive organisation, then
physical output (use values) must be."* [**Against Capitalism**, p. 86]
However, Schweickart is wrong. Horizontal links need not be market based
and co-operation between individuals and groups need not be
hierarchical. What is implied in this comment is that there is just two
ways to relate to others -- either by prostitution (purely by cash) or
by hierarchy (the way of the state, the army or capitalist workplace).
But people relate to each other in other ways, such as friendship, love,
solidarity, mutual aid and so on. Thus you can help or associate with
others without having to be ordered to do so or by being paid cash to do
so -- we do so all the time. You can work together because by so doing
you benefit yourself and the other person. This is the **real**
communist way, that of mutual aid and free agreement.

So Schweickart is ignoring the vast majority of relations in any
society. For example, love/attraction is a horizontal link between two
autonomous individuals and profit considerations do not enter into the
relationship. Thus anarchists argue that Schweickart's argument is
flawed as it fails to recognise that resource usage and production
techniques can be organised in terms of human need and free agreement
between economic actors, without profits or central command. This system
does not mean that we all have to love each other (an impossible wish).
Rather, it means that we recognise that by voluntarily co-operating as
equals we ensure that we remain free individuals and that we can gain
the advantages of sharing resources and work (for example, a reduced
working day and week, self-managed work in safe and hygienic working
conditions and a free selection of the product of a whole society). In
other words, a self-interest which exceeds the narrow and impoverished
egotism of capitalist society.

Thus free agreement and horizontal links are not limited to market
transactions -- they develop for numerous reasons and anarchists
recognise this. As George Barrett argued:

> 17-19]

To make productive decisions we need to know what others need and
information in order to evaluate the alternative options available to us
to satisfy that need. Therefore, it is a question of distributing
information between producers and consumers, information which the
market often hides (or actively blocks) or distorts due to inequalities
in resources (i.e. need does not count in the market, *"effective
demand"* does and this skews the market in favour of the wealthy). This
information network has partly been discussed in the [last
section](secI4.html#seci44) where a method of comparison between
different materials, techniques and resources based upon use value was
discussed. In addition, the need to indicate the current fluctuations in
stocks, production and consumption has also to be factored in when
making decisions.

To indicate the relative changes in scarcity of a given good it will be
necessary to calculate what could be termed its *"scarcity index."* This
would inform potential users of this good whether its demand is
outstripping its supply so that they may effectively adjust their
decisions in light of the decisions of others. This index could be, for
example, a percentage figure which indicates the relation of orders
placed for a good to the amount actually produced. For example, a good
which has a demand higher than its supply would have an index value of
101% or higher. This value would inform potential users to start looking
for substitutes for it or to economise on its use. Such a scarcity
figure would exist for each syndicate as well as (possibly) a
generalised figure for the industry as a whole on a regional,
"national", etc. level.

In this way, a specific good could be seen to be in high demand and so
only those producers who **really** required it would place orders for
it (so ensuring effective use of resources). Needless to say, stock
levels and other basic book-keeping techniques would be utilised in
order to ensure a suitable buffer level of a specific good existed. This
may result in some excess supply of goods being produced and used as
stock to handle unexpected changes in the aggregate demand for a good.
Such a buffer system would work on an individual workplace level and at
a communal level. Syndicates would obviously have their inventories,
stores of raw materials and finished goods "on the shelf" which can be
used to meet unexpected increases in demand. Communal stores, hospitals
and so on would have their stores of supplies in case of unexpected
disruptions in supply.

This is a common practice even in capitalism, with differences between
actual demand and expected demand being absorbed by unintended stock
changes. Firms today also have spare capacity in order to meet such
upsurges in demand. Such policies of maintaining stocks and spare
capacity will continue to the case under anarchism. It is assumed that
syndicates and their confederations will wish to adjust capacity if they
are aware of the need to do so. Hence, price changes in response to
changes in demand would not be necessary to provide the information that
such adjustments are required. This is because a *"change in demand
first becomes apparent as a change in the quantity being sold at
existing prices [or being consumed in a moneyless system] and is
therefore reflected in changes in stocks or orders. Such changes are
perfectly good indicators or signals that an imbalance between demand
and current output has developed. If a change in demand for its products
proved to be permanent, a production unit would find its stocks being
run down and its order book lengthening, or its stocks increasing and
orders falling . . . Price changes in response to changes in demand are
therefore not necessary for the purpose of providing information about
the need to adjust capacity."* [Pat Devine, **Democracy and Economic
Planning**, p. 242]

So syndicates, communes and their confederations will create buffer
stocks of goods to handle unforeseen changes in demand and supply. This
sort of inventory has also been used by capitalist countries like the
USA to prevent changes in market conditions for agricultural products
and other strategic raw materials producing wild spot-price movements
and inflation. Post-Keynesian economist Paul Davidson argued that the
stability of commodity prices this produced *"was an essential aspect of
the unprecedented prosperous economic growth of the world's economy"*
between 1945 and 1972. US President Nixon dismantled these buffer zone
programmes, resulting in *"violent commodity price fluctuations"* which
had serious negative economic effects. [**Controversies in
Post-Keynesian Economics**, p. 114 and p. 115] Again, an anarchist
society is likely to utilise this sort of buffer system to iron out
short-term changes in supply and demand. By reducing short-term
fluctuations of the supply of commodities, bad investment decisions
would be reduced as syndicates would not be mislead, as is the case
under capitalism, by market prices being too high or too low at the time
when the decisions where being made (as discussed in [section
I.1.5](secI1.html#seci15) such disequilibrium prices convey
misinformation which causes very substantial economic distortions).

This, combined with cost-benefit analysis described in [section
I.4.4](secI4.html#seci44), would allow information about changes within
a moneyless economy to rapidly spread throughout the whole system and
influence all decision makers without the great majority knowing
anything about the original causes of these changes. This would allow a
syndicate to ascertain which good used up least resources and therefore
left the most over for other uses (i.e., relative costs or scarcity) as
well as giving them information on what resources were used to create it
(i.e., the absolute costs involved) The relevant information is
communicated to all involved, without having to be ordered by an
"all-knowing" central body as in a Leninist centrally planned economy.
As argued in [section I.1.2](secI1.html#seci12), anarchists have long
realised that no centralised body could possibly be able to possess all
the information dispersed throughout the economy to organise production
and if such a body attempted to do so, the resulting bureaucracy would
effectively reduce and impoverish the amount of information available to
decision makers and so cause shortages and inefficiencies.

To get an idea how this system could work, let us take the example of a
change in the copper industry. Let us assume that a source of copper
unexpectedly fails or that the demand for copper increases. What would
happen?

First, the initial difference would be a diminishing of stocks of copper
which each syndicate maintains to take into account unexpected changes
in requests. This would help buffer out short lived, changes in supply
or requests. Second, naturally, there is an increase in demand for
copper for those syndicates which are producing it. This immediately
increases the **scarcity index** of those firms and their product. For
example, the index may rise from 95% (indicating a slight
over-production in respect to current demand) to 115% (indicating that
the demand for copper has risen in respect to the current level of
production). This change in the **scarcity index** (combined with
difficulties in finding copper producing syndicates which will accept
their orders) enters into the decision making algorithms of other
syndicates. This, in turn, results in changes in their plans. For
example, the syndicates can seek out other suppliers who have a lower
scarcity index or substitutes for copper may be used as they have become
a more efficient resource to use.

In this way, requests for copper products fall and soon only reflect
those requests that really need copper (i.e., do not have realistic
substitutes available for it). This would result in the demand falling
with respect to the current supply (as indicated by requests from other
syndicates and to maintain buffer stock levels). Thus a general message
has been sent across the economy that copper has become (relatively)
scare and syndicate plans have changed in light of this information. No
central planner made these decisions nor was money required to
facilitate them. We have a decentralised, non-market system based on the
free exchange of products between self-governing associations.

Looking at the wider picture, the question of how to response to this
change in supply/requests for copper presents itself. The copper
syndicate federation and cross-industry syndicate federations have
regular meetings and the question of the changes in the copper situation
present themselves and they must consider how to response to these
changes. Part of this is to determine whether this change is likely to
be short term or long term. A short term change (say caused by a mine
accident, for example) would not need new investments to be planned.
However, long term changes (say the new requests are due to a new
product being created by another syndicate or an existing mine becoming
exhausted) may need co-ordinated investment (we can expect syndicates to
make their own plans in light of changes, for example, by investing in
new machinery to produce copper more efficiently or to increase
production). If the expected changes of these plans approximately equal
the predicted long term changes, then the federation need not act.
However, if they do then investment in new copper mines or large scale
new investment across the industry may be required. The federation would
propose such plans.

Needless to say, the future can be guessed, it cannot be accurately
predicted. Thus there may be over-investment in certain industries as
expected changes do not materialise. However, unlike capitalism, this
would not result in an economic crisis (with over-investment within
capitalism, workplaces close due to lack of profits, regardless of
social need). All that would happen is that some of the goods produced
would not be used, some labour and resources would be wasted and the
syndicates would rationalise production, close down relatively
inefficient plant and concentrate production in the more efficient ones.
The sweeping economic crises of capitalism would be a thing of the past.

In summary, each syndicate receives its own orders and supplies and
sends its own produce out to specific consumers. Similarly, communal
distribution centres would order required goods from syndicates it
determines. In this way consumers can change to syndicates which respond
to their needs and so production units are aware of what it is socially
useful for them to produce as well as the social cost of the resources
they need to produce it. In this way a network of horizontal relations
spread across society, with co-ordination achieved by equality of
association and not the hierarchy of the corporate structure.

While anarchists are aware of the *"isolation paradox"* (see [section
B.6](secB6.html)) this does not mean that they think the commune should
make decisions **for** people on what they were to consume. That would
be a prison. No, all anarchists agree that is up to the individual to
determine their own needs and for the collectives they join to determine
social requirements like parks, infrastructure improvements and so on.
However, social anarchists think that it would be beneficial to discuss
the framework around which these decisions would be made. This would
mean, for example, that communes would agree to produce eco-friendly
products, reduce waste and generally make decisions enriched by social
interaction. Individuals would still decide which sort goods they
desire, based on what the collectives produce but these goods would be
based on a socially agreed agenda. In this way waste, pollution and
other *"externalities"* of atomised consumption could be reduced. For
example, while it is rational for individuals to drive a car to work,
collectively this results in massive **irrationality** (for example,
traffic jams, pollution, illness, unpleasant social infrastructures). A
sane society would discuss the problems associated with car use and
would agree to produce a fully integrated public transport network which
would reduce pollution, stress, illness, and so on.

Therefore, while anarchists recognise individual tastes and desires,
they are also aware of the social impact of them and so try to create a
social environment where individuals can enrich their personal decisions
with the input of other people's ideas.

On a related subject, it is obvious that different syndicates would
produce slightly different goods, so ensuring that people have a choice.
It is doubtful that the current waste implied in multiple products from
different companies (sometimes the same multi-national corporation!) all
doing the same job would be continued in an anarchist society. However,
production will be *"variations on a theme"* in order to ensure consumer
choice and to allow the producers to know what features consumers
prefer. It would be impossible to sit down beforehand and make a list of
what features a good should have -- that assumes perfect knowledge and
that technology is fairly constant. Both these assumptions are of
limited use in real life. Therefore, co-operatives would produce goods
with different features and production would change to meet the demand
these differences suggest (for example, factory A produces a new CD
player, and consumption patterns indicate that this is popular and so
the rest of the factories convert). This is in addition to R&D
experiments and test populations. In this way consumer choice would be
maintained, and enhanced as people would be able to influence the
decisions of the syndicates as producers (in some cases) and through
syndicate/commune dialogue.

Finally, it would be churlish, but essential, to note that capitalism
only equates supply and demand in the fantasy world of neo-classical
economics. Any **real** capitalist economy, as we discussed in [section
I.1.5](secI1.html#seci15) is marked by uncertainty and a tendency to
over-produce in the response to the higher profits caused by previously
under-producing goods, with resulting periods of crisis in which falling
effective demand sees a corresponding fall in supply. Not to the mention
the awkward fact that real needs (demand) are not met simply because
people are too poor to pay for the goods (i.e., no effective demand). As
such, to suggest that only non-market systems have a problem ensuring
demand and supply meet is mistaken.

To conclude, anarchists do not ignore *"supply and demand."* Instead,
they recognise the limitations of the capitalist version of this truism
and point out that capitalism is based on **effective** demand which has
no necessary basis with efficient use of resources. Instead of the
market, social anarchists advocate a system based on horizontal links
between producers which effectively communicates information across
society about the relative changes in supply and demand which reflect
actual needs of society and not bank balances. The investment response
to changes in supply and demand will be discussed in [section
I.4.8](secI4.html#seci48) while [section I.4.13](secI4.html#seci413)
will discuss the allocation of work tasks.

I.4.6 Surely anarchist-communism would just lead to demand exceeding supply?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

While non-communist forms of anarchism relate consumption to work done,
so automatically relating demand to production, this is not the case in
communist-anarchism. In that system, distribution is according to need,
not deed. Given this, it is a common objection that libertarian
communism would lead to people wasting resources by taking more than
they need.

Kropotkin, for example, stated that *"free communism . . . places the
product reaped or manufactured at the disposal of all, leaving to each
the liberty to consume them as he pleases in his own home."* [**The
Place of Anarchism in the Evolution of Socialist Thought**, p. 7] But,
some argue, what if an individual says they "need" a luxury house or a
personal yacht? Simply put, workers may not "need" to produce it. As Tom
Brown put it, *"such things are the product of social labour . . . Under
syndicalism . . . it is improbable that any greedy, selfish person would
be able to kid a shipyard full of workers to build him a ship all for
his own hoggish self. There would be steam luxury yachts, but they would
be enjoyed in common."* [**Syndicalism**, p. 51]

Therefore, communist-anarchists are not blind to the fact that free
access to products is based upon the actual work of real individuals --
"society" provides nothing, individuals working together do. This is
reflected in the classic statement of communism: *"From each according
to their ability, to each according to their needs."* This must be
considered as a whole as those producing have needs and those receiving
have abilities. The needs of both consumer **and** producer have to be
taken into account, and this suggests that those producing have to feel
the need to do so. This means that if no syndicate or individual desires
to produce a specific order then this order can be classed as an
"unreasonable" demand -- "unreasonable" in this context meaning that no
one freely agrees to produce it. Of course, individuals may agree to
barter services in order to get what they want produced if they
**really** want something but such acts in no way undermines a communist
society.

This also applies to the demand for goods which are scare and, as a
result, require substantial labour and resources to produce. In such
circumstances, the producers (either as a specific syndicate or in their
confederations) would refuse to supply such a "need" or communes and
their confederations would suggest that this would be waste of
resources. Ultimately, a free society would seek to avoid the
irrationalities of capitalism where the drive for profits results in
production for the sake of production and consumption for the sake of
consumption and the many work longer and harder to meet the demands of a
(wealthy) few. A free people would evaluate the pros and cons of any
activity before doing it. As Malatesta put it:

> *"[A] communist society . . . is not, obviously, about an absolute
> right to satisfy **all** of one's needs, because needs are infinite .
> . . so their satisfaction is always limited by productive capacity;
> nor would it be useful or just that the community in order to satisfy
> excessive needs, otherwise called caprices, of a few individuals,
> should undertake work, out of proportion to the utility being produced
> . . . What we would like is for everybody to live in the best possible
> way: so that everybody with a minimum amount of effort will obtain
> maximum satisfaction."* [**At the Café**, pp. 60-1]

Communist-anarchists recognise that production, like consumption, must
be based on freedom. However, it has been argued that free access would
lead to waste as people take more than they would if they had to pay for
it. This objection is not as serious as it first appears. There are
plenty of examples within current society to indicate that free access
will not lead to abuses. Let us take a few examples. In public libraries
people are free to sit and read books all day but few, if any, actually
do so. Neither do people always take the maximum number of books out at
a time. No, they use the library as they need to and feel no need to
maximise their use of the institution. Some people never use the
library, although it is free. In the case of water supplies, it is clear
that people do not leave taps on all day because water is often supplied
freely or for a fixed charge. Similarly with pavements, people do not
walk everywhere because to do so is free. In such cases individuals use
the resource as and when they need to. Equally, vegetarians do not start
eating meat when they visit their friend's parties just because the
buffet is free.

We can expect similar results as other resources become freely
available. In effect, this argument makes as much sense as arguing that
individuals will travel to stops **beyond** their destination if public
transport is based on a fixed charge! Obviously only an idiot would
travel further than required in order to get "value for money." However,
for many the world seems to be made up of such fools. Perhaps it would
be advisable for such critics to hand out political leaflets in the
street. Even though the leaflets are free, crowds rarely form around the
person handing them out demanding as many copies of the leaflet as
possible. Rather, those interested in what the leaflets have to say take
them, the rest ignore them. If free access automatically resulted in
people taking more than they need then critics of free communism would
be puzzled by the lack of demand for what they were handing out!

Part of the problem is that capitalist economics has invented a
fictional type of person, **Homo Economicus,** whose wants are
limitless: an individual who always wants more and so whose needs could
only satisfied if resources were limitless too. Needless to say, such an
individual has never existed. In reality, wants are not limitless --
people have diverse tastes and rarely want everything available nor want
more of a good than that which satisfies their need.

Communist Anarchists also argue that we cannot judge people's buying
habits under capitalism with their actions in a free society. After all,
advertising does not exist to meet people's needs but rather to create
needs by making people insecure about themselves. Simply put,
advertising does not amplify existing needs or sell the goods and
services that people already want. Advertising would not need to stoop
to the level of manipulative adverts that create false personalities for
products and provide solutions for problems that the advertisers
themselves create if this were the case. Crude it may be, but
advertising is based on the creation of insecurities, preying on fears
and obscuring rational thought. In an alienated society in which people
are subject to hierarchical controls, feelings of insecurity and lack of
control and influence would be natural. It is these fears that
advertising multiples -- if you cannot have real freedom, then at least
you can buy something new. Advertising is the key means of making people
unhappy with what they have and who they are. It is naive to claim that
advertising has no effect on the psyche of the receiver or that the
market merely responds to the populace and makes no attempt to shape
their thoughts. If advertising did not work, firms would not spend so
much money on it! Advertising creates insecurities about such
matter-of-course things and so generates irrational urges to buy which
would not exist in a libertarian communist society.

However, there is a deeper point to be made here about consumerism.
Capitalism is based on hierarchy, not liberty. This leads to a weakening
of individuality as well as a lose of self-identity and sense of
community. Both these senses are a deep human need and consumerism is
often a means by which people overcome their alienation from their
selves and others (religion, ideology and drugs are other means of
escape). Therefore the consumption within capitalism reflects **its**
values, not some abstract "human nature." As such, because a firm or
industry is making a profit satisfying "needs" within capitalism, it
does not follow that people in a free society would have similar wants
(i.e., "demand" often does not exist independently of the surrounding
society). As Bob Black argues:

> *"what we want, what we are capable of wanting is relative to the
> forms of social organisation. People 'want' fast food because they
> have to hurry back to work, because processed supermarket food doesn't
> taste much better anyway, because the nuclear family (for the
> dwindling minority who have even that to go home to) is too small and
> too stressed to sustain much festivity in cooking and eating -- and so
> forth. It is only people who can't get what they want who resign
> themselves to want more of what they can get. Since we cannot be
> friends and lovers, we wail for more candy."* [**Friendly Fire"**, p.
> 57]

Therefore, most anarchists think that consumerism is a product of a
hierarchical society within which people are alienated from themselves
and the means by which they can make themselves **really** happy (i.e.
meaningful relationships, liberty, self-managed productive activity, and
so on). Consumerism is a means of filling the spiritual hole capitalism
creates within us by denying our freedom and violating equality. This
means that capitalism produces individuals who define themselves by what
they have, not who they are. This leads to consumption for the sake of
consumption, as people try to make themselves happy by consuming more
commodities. But, as Erich Fromm pointed out, this cannot work for long
and only leads to even more insecurity (and so even more consumption):

> *"**If I am what I have and if what I have is lost, who then am I?**
> Nobody but a defeated, deflated, pathetic testimony to a wrong way of
> living. Because I **can** lose what I have, I am necessarily
> constantly worried that I **shall** lose what I have."* [**To Have Or
> To Be**, p. 111]

Such insecurity easily makes consumerism seem a "natural" way of life
and so make communism seem impossible. However, rampant consumerism is
far more a product of lack of meaningful freedom within an alienated
society than a "natural law" of human existence. In a society that
encouraged and protected individuality by non-hierarchical social
relationships and organisations, individuals would have a strong sense
of self and so be less inclined to mindlessly consume. As Fromm put it:
*"If **I am what I am** and not what I have, nobody can deprive me of or
threaten my security and my sense of identity. My centre is within
myself."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 112] Such self-centred individuals do not
have to consume endlessly to build a sense of security or happiness
within themselves.

In other words, the well-developed individuality that an anarchist
society would develop would have less need to consume than the average
person in a capitalist one. This is not to suggest that life will be
bare and without luxuries in an anarchist society, far from it. A
society based on the free expression of individuality could be nothing
but rich in wealth and diverse in goods and experiences. What we are
arguing here is that an anarchist-communist society would not have to
fear rampant consumerism making demand outstrip supply constantly and
always precisely because freedom will result in a non-alienated society
of well developed individuals.

It should not be forgotten that communism has two conditions,
distribution according to need **and** production according to ability.
If the latter condition is not met, if someone does not contribute to
the goods available in the libertarian communist society, then the
former condition is not likely to be tolerated and they would be asked
to leave so reducing demand for goods. The freedom to associate means
being free **not** to associate. Thus a free communist society would see
goods being supplied as well as demanded. As Malatesta argued:

> *"Basic to the anarchist system, before communism or any other forms
> of social conviviality is the principle of the free compact; the rule
> of integral communism -- 'from each according to his [or her] ability,
> to each according to his [or her] need' -- applies only to those who
> accept it, including naturally the conditions which make it
> practicable."* [quoted by Camillo Berneri, *"The Problem of Work"*,
> pp. 59-82, **Why Work?**, Vernon Richards (ed.), p. 74]

So, as Malatesta suggested, it should be noted that communist-anarchists
are well aware that it is likely that free access to all goods and
services cannot be done immediately (see [section
H.2.5](secH2.html#sech25) for details). As Alexander Berkman summarised,
*"when the social revolution attains the stage where it can produce
sufficient for all, then is adopted the Anarchist principle of 'to each
according to his [or her] needs' . . . But until it is reached, the
system of equal sharing . . . is imperative as the only just method. It
goes without saying, of course, that special consideration must be given
to the sick and the old, to children, and to women during and after
pregnancy."* [**What is Anarchism?**, p. 216] Another possibility was
suggested by James Guillaume who argued that as long as a product was
*"in short supply it will to a certain extent have to be rationed. And
the easiest way to do this would be to **sell** these scare products"*
but as production grows then *"it will not be necessary to ration
consumption. The practice of selling, which was adopted as a sort of
deterrent to immoderate consumption, will be abolished"* and goods
*"will be distribute[d] . . . in accordance with the needs of the
consumers."* [*"On Building the New Social Order"*, pp. 356-79,
**Bakunin on Anarchism**, p. 368] Other possibilities may include
communes deciding that certain scare goods are only available to those
who do the unpleasant work (such as collecting the rubbish) or that
people have equal access but the actual goods are shared and used for
short periods of time (as is currently the case with public libraries).
As Situationist Ken Knabb suggests after usefully discussing *"just some
of the possibilities"*: *"Experimenting with different methods, people
will find out for themselves what forms of ownership, exchange and
reckoning are necessary."* [**Public Secrets**, p. 73]

Whether or not full communism **can** be introduced instantly is a moot
point amongst collectivist and communist anarchists, although most would
like to see society develop towards a communist goal eventually. Of
course, for people used to capitalism this may sound totally utopian.
Possibly it is. However, as Oscar Wilde said, a map of the world without
Utopia on it is not worth having. One thing is sure, if the developments
we have outlined above fail to appear and attempts at communism fail due
to waste and demand exceeding supply then a free society would make the
necessary decisions and introduce some means of limiting supply (such
as, for example, labour notes, equal wages, and so on). Rest assured,
though, *"the difficulty will be solved and obstacles in the shape of
making necessary changes in the detailed working of the system of
production and its relation to consumption, will vanish before the
ingenuity of the myriad minds vitally concerned in overcoming them."*
[Charlotte M. Wilson, **Anarchist Essays**, p. 21]

I.4.7 What will stop producers ignoring consumers?
--------------------------------------------------

It is often claimed that without a market producers would ignore the
needs of consumers. Without the threat (and fear) of unemployment and
destitution and the promise of higher profits, producers would turn out
shoddy goods. The holders of this argument point to the example of the
Soviet Union which was notorious for terrible goods and a lack of
consumer commodities.

Capitalism, in comparison to the old Soviet block, does, to some degree,
make the producers accountable to the consumers. If the producer ignores
the desires of the consumer then they will loose business to those who
do not and be forced, perhaps, out of business (large companies, of
course, due to their resources can hold out far longer than smaller
ones). Thus we have the carrot (profits) and the stick (fear of poverty)
-- although, of course, the carrot can be used as a stick against the
consumer (no profit, no sale, no matter how much the consumer may need
it). Ignoring the obvious objection to this analogy (namely we are human
beings, **not** donkeys!) it does have contain an important point. What
will ensure that consumer needs are meet in an anarchist society?

In an Individualist or Mutualist anarchist system, as it is based on a
market, producers would be subject to market forces and so have to meet
consumers needs. Collectivist-anarchism meets consumer needs in a
similar way, as producers would be accountable to consumers by the
process of buying and selling between co-operatives. As James Guillaume
put it, the workers associations would *"deposit their unconsumed
commodities in the facilities provided by the [communal] Bank of
Exchange . . . The Bank of Exchange would remit to the producers
negotiable **vouchers** representing the value of their products"* (this
value *"having been established in advance by a contractual agreement
between the regional co-operative federations and the various
communes"*). [*"On Building the New Social Order"*, pp. 356-79,
**Bakunin on Anarchism**, pp. 366] If the goods are not in demand then
the producer associations would not be able to sell the product of their
labour to the Bank of Exchange (or directly to other syndicates or
communes) and so they would adjust their output accordingly. Of course,
there are problems with these systems due to their basis in the market
(as discussed in [section I.1.3](secI1.html#seci13)), although these
problems were recognised by Proudhon who argued for an agro-industrial
federation to protect self-management from the negative effects of
market forces (as noted in [section I.3.5](secI3.html#seci35)).

While mutualist and collectivist anarchists can argue that producers
would respond to consumer needs otherwise they would not get an income,
communist-anarchists (as they seek a moneyless society) cannot argue
their system would reward producers in this way. So what mechanism
exists to ensure that *"the wants of all"* are, in fact, met? How does
anarcho-communism ensure that production becomes *"the mere servant of
consumption"* and *"mould itself on the wants of the consumer, not
dictate to him conditions"*? [Peter Kropotkin, **Act for Yourselves**,
p. 57] Libertarian communists argue that in a **free** communist society
consumers' needs would be met. This is because of the decentralised and
federal nature of such a society.

So what is the mechanism which makes producers accountable to consumers
in a libertarian communist society? Firstly, communes would practice
their power of ***"exit"*** in the distributive network. If a syndicate
was producing sub-standard goods or refusing to change their output in
the face of changing consumer needs, then the communal stores would turn
to those syndicates which **were** producing the goods desired. The
original syndicates would then be producing for their own stocks, a
pointless task and one few, if any, would do. After all, people
generally desire their work to have meaning, to be useful. To just work,
producing something no-one wanted would be such a demoralising task that
few, if any, sane people would do it (under capitalism people put up
with spirit destroying work as some income is better than none, such an
"incentive" would not exist in a free society).

As can be seen, ***"exit"*** would still exist in libertarian communism.
However, it could be argued that unresponsive or inefficient syndicates
would still exist, exploiting the rest of society by producing rubbish
(or goods which are of less than average quality) and consuming the
products of other people's labour, confident that without the fear of
poverty and unemployment they can continue to do this indefinitely.
Without the market, it is argued, some form of bureaucracy would be
required (or develop) which would have the power to punish such
syndicates. Thus the state would continue in "libertarian" communism,
with the "higher" bodies using coercion against the lower ones to ensure
they meet consumer needs or produced enough.

While, at first glance, this appears to be a possible problem on closer
inspection it is flawed. This is because anarchism is based not only on
***"exit"*** but also ***"voice"***. Unlike capitalism, libertarian
communism is based on association and communication. Each syndicate and
commune is in free agreement and confederation with all the others.
Thus, is a specific syndicate was producing bad goods or not pulling its
weight, then those in contact with them would soon realise this. First,
those unhappy with a syndicate's work would appeal to them directly to
get their act together. If this did not work, then they would notify
their disapproval by refusing to associate with them in the future (i.e.
they would use their power of ***"exit"*** as well as refusing to
provide the syndicate with any goods **it** requires). They would also
let society as a whole know (via the media) as well as contacting
consumer groups and co-operatives and the relevant producer and communal
confederations which they and the other syndicate are members of, who
would, in turn, inform their members of the problems (the relevant
confederations could include local and regional communal confederations,
the general cross-industry confederation, its own industrial/communal
confederation and the confederation of the syndicate not pulling its
weight). In today's society, a similar process of "word of mouth"
warnings and recommendations goes on, along with consumer groups and
media. Our suggestions here are an extension of this common practice
(that this process exists suggests that the price mechanism does not, in
fact, provide consumers with all the relevant information they need to
make decisions, but this is an aside).

If the syndicate in question, after a certain number of complaints had
been lodged against it, still did not change its ways, then it would
suffer non-violent direct action. This would involve the boycotting of
the syndicate and (perhaps) its local commune (such as denying it
products and investment), so resulting in the syndicate being excluded
from the benefits of association. The syndicate would face the fact that
no one else wanted to associate with it and suffer a drop in the goods
coming its way, including consumption products for its members. In
effect, a similar process would occur to that of a firm under capitalism
that looses its customers and so its income. However, we doubt that a
free society would subject any person to the evils of destitution or
starvation (as capitalism does). Rather, a bare minimum of goods
required for survival would still be available.

In the unlikely event this general boycott did not result in a change of
heart, then two options are left available. These are either the
break-up of the syndicate and the finding of its members new work places
or the giving/selling of the syndicate to its current users (i.e. to
exclude them from the society they obviously do not want to be part
off). The decision of which option to go for would depend on the
importance of the workplace in question and the desires of the
syndicates' members. If the syndicate refused to disband, then option
two would be the most logical choice (unless the syndicate controlled a
scare resource). The second option would, perhaps, be best as this would
drive home the benefits of association as the expelled syndicate would
have to survive on its own, subject to survival by selling the product
of its labour and would soon return to the fold.

Kropotkin argued in these terms over 100 years ago:

> *"When a railway company, federated with other companies, fails to
> fulfil its engagements, when its trains are late and goods lie
> neglected at the stations, the other companies threaten to cancel the
> contract, and that threat usually suffices.*

> *"It is generally believed . . . that commerce only keeps to its
> engagements from fear of lawsuits. Nothing of the sort; nine times in
> ten the trader who has not kept his word will not appear before a
> judge . . . the sole fact of having driven a creditor to bring a

> *"This being so, why should means that are used today among . . .
> traders in the trade, and railway companies in the organisation of
> transport, not be made use of in a society based on voluntary work?"*
> [**The Conquest of Bread**, p. 153]

Thus, to ensure producer accountability of production to consumption, no
bureaucratic body is required in libertarian communism (or any other
form of anarchism). Rather, communication and direct action by those
affected by unresponsive producers would be an effective and efficient
means of ensuring the accountability of production to consumption.

I.4.8 What about investment decisions?
--------------------------------------

Obviously, a given society needs to take into account changes in
consumption and so invest in new means of production. An anarchist
society is no different. As Guild Socialist G.D.H Cole points out, *"it
is essential at all times, and in accordance with considerations which
vary from time to time, for a community to preserve a balance between
production for ultimate use and production for use in further
production. And this balance is a matter which ought to be determined by
and on behalf of the whole community."* [**Guild Socialism Restated**,
p. 144]

How this balance is determined varies according to the school of
anarchist thought considered. All agree, however, that such an important
task should be under effective community control.

The mutualists see the solution to the problems of investment as
creating a system of mutual banks, which reduce interest rates to zero.
This would be achieved *"[b]y the organisation of credit, on the
principle of reciprocity or mutualism . . . In such an organisation
credit is raised to the dignity of a social function, managed by the
community; and, as society never speculates upon its members, it will
lend its credit . . . at the actual cost of transaction."* [Charles A.
Dana, **Proudhon and his *"Bank of the People"***, p. 36] Loans would be
allocated to projects which the mutual banks considered likely to
succeed and repay the original loan. In this way, the increase in the
money supply implied by these acts of credit providing does not generate
inflation for money is **not** created wantonly but rather is aimed at
projects which are considered likely to **increase** the supply of goods
and services in the economy (see [section G.3.6](secG3.html#secg36)).
Another key source of investment would be internal funds (i.e., retained
savings) as is the case with co-operatives today: *"Worker-managers
finance their new investments partly out of internal funds and partly
from external loans . . . Entrepreneurial activity of worker-managers .
. . generates profits and losses, i.e., higher or lower income per
worker."* [Branko Horvat, *"The Theory of the Worker-Managed Firm
Revisited"*, pp. 9-25, **Journal of Comparative Economics**, vol. 10,
no. 1, p. 21] As discussed in [section I.1.1](secI1.html#seci11),
eliminating the stock market will not harm investment (almost all
investment funds are from other sources) and will remove an important
negative influence in economic activity.

Collectivist and communist anarchists recognise that credit is based on
human activity, which is represented as money. As Cole pointed out, the
*"understanding of this point [on investment] depends on a clear
appreciation of the fact that all real additions to capital take the
form of directing a part of the productive power of labour and using
certain materials not for the manufacture of products and the rendering
of services incidental to such manufacture for purposes of purposes of
further production."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 143] So collectivist and
communist anarchists agree with their Mutualist cousins when they state
that *"[a]ll credit presupposes labour, and, if labour were to cease,
credit would be impossible"* and that the *"legitimate source of
credit"* was *"the labouring classes"* who *"ought to control it"* and
for *"whose benefit [it should] be used"*. [Dana, **Op. Cit.**, p. 35]

Therefore, in collectivism, investment funds would exist for syndicates,
communes and their in community (*"People's"*) banks. These would be
used to store depreciation funds and as well as other funds agreed to by
the syndicates for investment projects (for example, confederations of
syndicates may agree to allocate a certain percentage of their labour
notes to a common account in order to have the necessary funds available
for major investment projects). Similarly, individual syndicates and
communes would also create a store of funds for their own investment
projects. Moreover, the confederations of syndicates to which these
*"People's Banks"* would be linked would also have a defined role in
investment decisions to ensure that production meets demand by being the
forum which decides which investment plans should be given funding
(this, we stress, is hardly "central planning" as capitalist firms also
plan future investments to meet expected demand). In this, collectivist
anarchism is like mutualism and so we would also expect interest-free
credit being arranged to facilitate investment.

In a communist-anarchist society, things would be slightly different as
this would not have the labour notes used in mutualism and collectivism.
This means that the productive syndicates would agree that a certain
part of their total output and activity will be directed to investment
projects. In effect, each syndicate is able to draw upon the resources
approved of by the co-operative commonwealth in the form of an agreed
claim on the labour power of society (investment *"is essentially an
allocation of material and labour, and fundamentally, an allocation of
human productive power."* [Cole, **Op. Cit.**, pp. 144-5]). In this way,
mutual aid ensures a suitable pool of resources for the future from
which all benefit.

It should be remembered that savings are not required before credit can
be issued. Under capitalism, for example, banks regularly issue credit
in excess of their actual reserves of cash (if they did not then, one,
they would not be very good capitalists and, two, the economy would
grind to a halt). Nor does the interest rate reflect a preference for
future goods (as discussed in [section C.2.6](secC2.html#secc26)
interest rates reflect market power, the degree of monopoly in the
credit industry, the social and class position of individuals and a host
of other factors). Moreover, a developed economy replaces a process in
time with a process in space. In peasant and tribal societies,
individuals usually did have to spend time and energy making their own
tools (the hunter had to stop hunting in order to create a new improved
bow or spear). However, with a reasonably developed division of work
then different people produce the tools others use and can do so at the
same time as the others produce. If workers producing investment goods
had to wait until sufficient savings had been gathered before starting
work then it is doubtful that any developed economy could function. Thus
the notion that "investment" needs saving is somewhat inappropriate, as
different workplaces produce consumption goods and others produce
investment goods. The issue becomes one of ensuring that enough people
and resources go towards both activities.

How would this work? Obviously investment decisions have implications
for society as a whole. The implementation of these decisions require
the use of **existing** capacity and so must be the responsibility of
the appropriate level of the confederation in question. Investment
decisions taken at levels above the production unit become effective in
the form of demand for the current output of the syndicates which have
the capacity to produce the goods required. This would require each
syndicate to *"prepare a budget, showing its estimate of requirements
both of goods or services for immediate use, and of extensions and
improvements."* [Cole, **Op. Cit.**, p. 145] These budgets and
investment projects would be discussed at the appropriate level of the
confederation (in this, communist-anarchism would be similar to
collectivist anarchism).

The confederation of syndicates/communes would be the ideal forum to
discuss (communicate) the various investment plans required -- and to
allocate scarce resources between different ends. This would involve,
possibly, dividing investment into two groups -- necessary and optional
-- and using statistical techniques to consider the impact of an
investment decision (for example, the use of input-output tables could
be used to see if a given investment decision in, say, the steel
industry would require investment in energy production). In this way
social needs **and** social costs would be taken into account and ensure
that investment decisions are not taken in isolation from one another,
so causing bottle-necks and insufficient production due to lack of
inputs from other industries.

Necessary investments are those which have been agreed upon by the
appropriate confederation. It means that resources and productive
capacity are prioritised towards them, as indicated in the agreed
investment project. It will not be required to determine precisely
**which** syndicates will provide the necessary goods for a given
investment project, just that it has priority over other requests. Under
capitalism, when a bank gives a company credit, it rarely asks exactly
which companies will be contracted with when the money is spent but,
rather, it gives the company the power to command the labour of other
workers by supplying them with credit/money. Similarly in an
anarcho-communist society, except that the other workers have agreed to
supply their labour for the project in question by designating it a
***"necessary investment"***. This means when a request arrives at a
syndicate for a ***"necessary investment"*** a syndicate must try and
meet it (i.e. it must place the request into its production schedule
before *"optional"* requests, assuming that it has the capacity to meet
it). A list of necessary investment projects, including what they
require and if they have been ordered, will be available to all
syndicates to ensure such a request is a real one.

Optional investment is simply investment projects which have not been
agreed to by a confederation. This means that when a syndicate or
commune places orders with a syndicate they may not be met or take
longer to arrive. The project may go ahead, but it depends on whether
the syndicate or commune can find workers willing to do that work. This
would be applicable for small scale investment decisions or those which
other communes/syndicates do not think of as essential.

This we have two inter-related investment strategies. A
communist-anarchist society would prioritise certain forms of investment
by the use of ***"necessary"*** and ***"optional"*** investment
projects. This socialisation of investment will allow a free society to
ensure that social needs are meet while maintaining a decentralised and
dynamic economy. Major projects to meet social needs will be organised
effectively, but with diversity for minor projects. The tasks of
ensuring investment production, making orders for specific goods and so
forth, would be as decentralised as other aspects of a free economy and
so anarchism *"proposes . . . [t]hat usufruct of instruments of
production -- land included -- should be free to all workers, or groups
of workers"*, that *"workers should group themselves, and arrange their
work as their reason and inclination prompt"* and that *"the necessary
connections between the various industries . . . should be managed on
the same voluntary principle."* [Charlotte M. Wilson, **Anarchist
Essays**, p. 21]

As for when investment is needed, it is clear that this will be based on
the changes in demand for goods in both collectivist and communist
anarchism. As Guilliaume put it: *"By means of statistics gathered from
all the communes in a region, it will be possible to scientifically
balance production and consumption. In line with these statistics, it
will also be possible to add more help in industries where production is
insufficient and reduce the number of men where there is a surplus of
production."* [*"On Building the New Social Order"*, pp. 356-79,
**Bakunin on Anarchism**, p. 370] Obviously, investment in branches of
production with a high demand would be essential and this would be
easily seen from the statistics generated by the collectives and
communes. Tom Brown made this obvious point:

> *"Goods, as now, will be produced in greater variety, for workers like
> producing different kinds, and new models, of goods. Now if some goods
> are unpopular, they will be left on the shelves . . . Of other goods
> more popular, the shops will be emptied. Surely it is obvious that the
> [shop] assistant will decrease his order of the unpopular line and
> increase his order of the popular."* [**Syndicalism**, p. 55]

As a rule of thumb, syndicates that produce investment goods would be
inclined to supply other syndicates who are experiencing excess demand
before others, all other things being equal. Because of such guidelines
and communication between producers, investment would go to those
industries that actually required them. In other words, customer choice
(as indicated by individuals choosing between the output of different
syndicates) would generate information that is relevant to investment
decisions.

As production would be decentralised as far as it is sensible and
rational to do so, each locality/region would be able to understand its
own requirements and apply them as it sees fit. This means that
large-scale planning would not be conducted (assuming that it could work
in practice, of course) simply because it would not be needed. This,
combined with an extensive communications network, would ensure that
investment not only did not duplicate unused plant within the economy
but that investments take into account the specific problems and
opportunities each locality has. Of course, collectives would experiment
with new lines and technology as well as existing lines and so invest in
new technologies and products. As occurs under capitalism, extensive
consumer testing would occur before dedicating major investment
decisions to new products.

In addition, investment decisions would also require information which
showed the different outcomes of different options. By this we simply
mean an analysis of how different investment projects relate to each
other in terms of inputs and outputs, compared to the existing
techniques. This would be in the form of cost-benefit analysis (as
outlined in [section I.4.4](secI4.html#seci44)) and would show when it
would make economic, social and ecological sense to switch industrial
techniques to more efficient and/or more empowering and/or more
ecologically sound methods. Such an evaluation would indicate levels of
inputs and compare them to the likely outputs. For example, if a new
production technique reduced the number of hours worked in total
(comparing the hours worked to produce the machinery with that reduced
in using it) as well as reducing waste products for a similar output,
then such a technique would be implemented.

Similarly with communities. A commune will obviously have to decide upon
and plan civic investment (e.g. new parks, housing and so forth). They
will also have the deciding say in industrial developments in their area
as it would be unfair for syndicate to just decide to build a cement
factory next to a housing co-operative if they did not want it. There is
a case for arguing that the local commune will decide on investment
decisions for syndicates in its area (for example, a syndicate may
produce X plans which will be discussed in the local commune and one
plan finalised from the debate). Regional decisions (for example, a new
hospital) could be decided at the appropriate level, with information
fed from the health syndicate and consumer co-operatives. The actual
location for investment decisions will be worked out by those involved.
However, local syndicates must be the focal point for developing new
products and investment plans in order to encourage innovation.

Therefore, under anarchism no capital market is required to determine
whether investment is required and what form it would take. The work
that apologists for capitalism claim currently is done by the stock
market can be replaced by co-operation and communication between
workplaces in a decentralised, confederated network. The relative needs
of different consumers of a product can be evaluated by the producers
and an informed decision reached on where it would best be used. Without
private property, housing, schools, hospitals, workplaces and so on will
no longer be cramped into the smallest space possible. Instead, they
will be built within a "green" environment. This means that human
constructions will be placed within a natural setting and no longer
stand apart from nature. In this way human life can be enriched and the
evils of cramping as many humans and things into a small a space as is
"economical" can be overcome.

Only by taking investment decisions away from "experts" and placing it
in the hands of ordinary people will current generations be able to
invest according to their, and future generations', benefit. It is
hardly in our best interests to have a system whose aim is to make the
wealthy even wealthier and on whose whims are dependent the lives of
millions of people.

I.4.9 Should technological advance be seen as anti-anarchistic?
---------------------------------------------------------------

Not necessarily. This is because technology can allow us to "do more
with less," technological progress can improve standards of living for
all people, and technologies can be used to increase personal freedom:
medical technology, for instance, can free people from the scourges of
pain, illness, and a "naturally" short life span; technology can be used
to free labour from mundane chores associated with production; advanced
communications technology can enhance our ability to freely associate.
The list is endless. So the vast majority of anarchists agree with
Kropotkin's comment that the *"development of [the industrial] technique
at last gives man [sic!] the opportunity to free himself from slavish
toil."* [**Ethics**, p. 2]

For example, increased productivity under capitalism usually leads to
further exploitation and domination, displaced workers, economic crisis,
etc. However, it does not have to so in an anarchist world. By way of
example, consider a commune in which 5 people desire to be bakers (or 5
people are needed to work the communal bakery) and 20 hours of
production per person, per week is spent on baking bread. Now, what
happens if the introduction of automation, **as desired, planned and
organised by the workers themselves**, reduces the amount of labour
required for bread production to 15 person-hours per week? Clearly, no
one stands to lose -- even if someone's work is "displaced" that person
will continue to receive the same access to the means of life as before
-- and they might even gain. This last is due to the fact that 5
person-hours have been freed up from the task of bread production, and
those person-hours may now be used elsewhere or converted to leisure,
either way increasing each person's standard of living.

Obviously, this happy outcome derives not only from the technology used,
but also (and critically) from its use in an equitable economic and
social system: in the end, there is no reason why the use of technology
cannot be used to empower people and increase their freedom!

Of course technology can be used for oppressive ends. Human knowledge,
like all things, can be used to increase freedom or to decrease it, to
promote inequality or reduce it, to aid the worker or to subjugate them,
and so on. Technology, as we argued in [section D.10](secD10.html),
cannot be considered in isolation from the society it is created and
used in. Most anarchists are aware that, to quote expert David Noble,
*"Capital invested in machines that would re-enforce the system of
domination [within the capitalist workplace], and this decision to
invest, which might in the long run render the chosen technology
economical, was not itself an economical decision but a political one,
with cultural sanction."* [**Progress Without People**, p. 6] In a
hierarchical society, technology will be introduced that serves the
interests of the powerful and helps marginalise and disempower the
majority (*"technology is political,"* to use Noble's expression). It
does not evolve in isolation from human beings and the social
relationships and power structures between them.

It is for these reasons that anarchists have held a wide range of
opinions concerning the relationship between human knowledge and
anarchism. Some, such as Peter Kropotkin, were themselves scientists and
saw great potential for the use of advanced technology to expand human
freedom. Others have held technology at arm's length, concerned about
its oppressive uses, and a few have rejected science and technology
completely. All of these are, of course, possible anarchist positions.
But most anarchists support Kropotkin's viewpoint, but with a healthy
dose of practical Luddism when viewing how technology is (ab)used in
capitalism (*"The worker will only respect machinery **in the day** when
it becomes his friend, shortening his work, rather than as **today,**
his enemy, taking away jobs, killing workers."* [Emile Pouget quoted by
David Noble, **Op. Cit.**, p. 15]). Vernon Richards stated the obvious:

> *"We maintain that the term 'productivity' has meaning, or is socially
> important, only when all production serves a public need . . .*

> *"Productivity has meaning if it results both in a raising of living
> standards and an increase of leisure for all.*

> *"'Productivity' in the society we live in, because it is not a means

> only alternative, which, in broad terms, is that the producers of
> wealth must control it for the benefit of all."* [**Why Work?**,
> Vernon Richards (ed.), p. 206]

This means that in an anarchist society, technology would have to be
transformed and/or developed which empowered those who used it, so
reducing any oppressive aspects associated with it. As Kropotkin argued,
we are (potentially) in a good position, because *"[f]or the first time
in the history of civilisation, mankind has reached a point where the
means of satisfying its needs are in excess of the needs themselves. To
impose, therefore, as hitherto been done, the curse of misery and
degradation upon vast divisions of mankind, in order to secure
well-being and further development for the few, is needed no more:
well-being can be secured for all, without placing on anyone the burden
of oppressive, degrading toil and humanity can at last build its entire
social life on the basis of justice."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 2] The question
is, for most anarchists, how can we humanise and modify this technology
and make it socially and individually liberatory, rather than destroying
it (where applicable, of course, certain forms of technology and
industry will be eliminated due to their inherently destructive nature).

For Kropotkin, like most anarchists, the way to humanise technology and
industry was for *"the workers [to] lay hands on factories, houses and
banks"* and so *"present production would be completely revolutionised
by this simple fact."* This would be the start of a process which would
**integrate** industry and agriculture, as it was *"essential that
work-shops, foundries and factories develop within the reach of the
fields."* [**The Conquest of Bread**, p. 190] Such a process would
obviously involve the transformation of both the structure and
technology of capitalism rather than its simple and unthinking
application. As discussed in [section A.3.9](secA3.html#seca39), while a
few anarchists do seek to eliminate all forms of technology, most would
agree with Bakunin when he argued that *"to destroy . . . all the
instruments of labour . . . would be to condemn all humanity -- which is
infinity too numerous today to exist . . . on the simple gifts of nature
. . . -- to . . . death by starvation."* His solution to the question of
technology was, like Kropotkin's, to place it at the service of those
who use it, to create *"the intimate and complete union of capital and
labour"* so that it would *"not . . . remain concentrated in the hands
of a separate, exploiting class."* Only this could *"smash the tyranny
of capital."* [**The Basic Bakunin**, pp. 90-1] So most anarchists seek
to transform rather then eliminate technology and to do that we need to
be in possession of the means of production before we can decide what to
keep, what to change and what to throw away as inhuman. In other words,
it is not enough to get rid of the boss, although this is a necessary
first step!

Anarchists of all types recognise the importance of critically
evaluating technology, industry and so on. The first step of any
revolution will be the seizing of the means of production. The second
**immediate** step will be the start of their radical transformation by
those who use them and are affected by them (i.e. communities, those who
use the products they produce and so on). Few, if any, anarchists seek
to maintain the current industrial set-up or apply, unchanged,
capitalist technology. We doubt that many of the workers who use that
technology and work in industry will leave either unchanged. Rather,
they will seek to liberate the technology they use from the influences
of capitalism, just as they liberated themselves.

This will, of course, involve the shutting down (perhaps instantly or
over a period of time) of many branches of industry and the abandonment
of such technology which cannot be transformed into something more
suitable for use by free individuals. And, of course, many workplaces
will be transformed to produce new goods required to meet the needs of
the revolutionary people or close due to necessity as a social
revolution will disrupt the market for their goods -- such as producers
of luxury export goods or suppliers of repressive equipment for state
security forces. Altogether, a social revolution implies the
transformation of technology and industry, just as it implies the
transformation of society.

This process of transforming work can be seen from the Spanish
Revolution. Immediately after taking over the means of production, the
Spanish workers started to transform it. They eliminated unsafe and
unhygienic working conditions and workplaces and created new workplaces
based on safe and hygienic working conditions. Working practices were
transformed as those who did the work (and so understood it) managed it.
Many workplaces were transformed to create products required by the war
effort (such as weapons, ammunition, tanks and so on) and to produce
consumer goods to meet the needs of the local population as the normal
sources of such goods, as Kropotkin predicted, were unavailable due to
economic disruption and isolation. Needless to say, these were only the
beginnings of the process but they clearly point the way any libertarian
social revolution would progress, namely the total transformation of
work, industry and technology. Technological change would develop along
new lines, ones which will take into account human and ecological needs
rather the power and profits of a minority.

Explicit in anarchism is the believe that capitalist and statist methods
cannot be used for socialist and libertarian ends. In our struggle for
workers' and community self-management is the awareness that workplaces
are not merely sites of production -- they are also sites of
**re**production, the reproduction of certain social relationships based
on specific relations of authority between those who give orders and
those who take them. The battle to democratise the workplace, to place
the collective initiative of the direct producers at the centre of any
productive activity, is clearly a battle to transform the workplace, the
nature of work and, by necessity, technology as well. As Kropotkin
argued:

> *"revolution is more than a mere change of the prevailing political
> system. It implies the awakening of human intelligence, the increasing
> of the inventive spirit tenfold, a hundredfold; it is the dawn of a
> new science . . . It is a revolution in the minds of men, as deep, and
> deeper still, than in their institutions . . . the sole fact of having
> laid hands on middle-class property will imply the necessity of
> completely re-organising the whole of economic life in the workplaces,
> the dockyards, the factories."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 192]

And some think that industry and technology will remain unchanged by
such a process and that workers will continue doing the same sort of
work, in the same way, using the same methods!

For Kropotkin *"all production has taken a wrong direction, as it is not
carried on with a view to securing well-being for all"* under
capitalism. [**Op. Cit.**, p. 101] Well-being for all obviously includes
those who do the producing and so covers the structure of industry and
the technological processes used. Similarly, well-being also includes a
person's environment and surroundings and so technology and industry
must be evaluated on an ecological basis. Technological progress in an
anarchist society, needless to say, will have to take into account these
factors as well as others people think are relevant, otherwise the ideal
of *"well-being for all"* is rejected (see [section
I.4.15](secI4.html#seci415) for a discussion of what the workplace of
the future could look like).

So, technology always partakes of and expresses the basic values of the
social system in which it is embedded. If you have a system (capitalism)
that alienates everything, it will naturally produce alienated forms of
technology and it will orient those technologies so as to reinforce
itself. Capitalists will select technology which re-enforces their power
and profits and skew technological change in that direction rather than
in those which empower individuals and make the workplace more
egalitarian.

All this suggests that technological progress is not neutral but
dependent on who makes the decisions. As David Noble argues,
*"[t]echnological determinism, the view that machines make history
rather than people, is not correct . . . If social changes now upon us
seem necessary, it is because they follow not from any disembodied
technological logic, but form a social logic."* Technology conforms to
*"the interests of power"* but as *"technological process is a social
process"* then *"it is, like all social processes, marked by conflict
and struggle, and the outcome, therefore, is always ultimately
indeterminate."* Viewing technological development *"as a social process
rather than as an autonomous, transcendent, and deterministic force can
be liberating . . . because it opens up a realm of freedom too long
denied. It restores people once again to their proper role as subjects
of the story, rather than mere pawns of technology . . . And
technological development itself, now seen as a social construct,
becomes a new variable rather than a first cause, consisting of a range
of possibilities and promising a multiplicity of futures."* [**Forces of
Production**, pp. 324-5]

This does not mean that we have to reject all technology and industry
because it has been shaped by, or developed within, class society.
Certain technologies are, of course, so insanely dangerous that they
will no doubt be brought to a prompt halt in any sane society.
Similarly, certain forms of technology and industrial process will be
impossible to transform as they are inherently designed for oppressive
ends. Many other industries which produce absurd, obsolete or
superfluous commodities will, of course, cease automatically with the
disappearance of their commercial or social rationales. But many
technologies, however they may presently be misused, have few if any
inherent drawbacks. They could be easily adapted to other uses. When
people free themselves from domination, they will have no trouble
rejecting those technologies that are harmful while adapting others to
beneficial uses.

Change society and the technology introduced and utilised will likewise
change. By viewing technological progress as a new variable, dependent
on those who make the decisions and the type of society they live in,
allows us to see that technological development is not inherently
anti-anarchist. A non-oppressive, non-exploitative, ecological society
will develop non-oppressive, non-exploitative, ecological technology
just as capitalism has developed technology which facilitates
exploitation, oppression and environmental destruction. Thus an
anarchist questions technology: The best technology? Best for whom? Best
for what? Best according to what criteria, what visions, according to
whose criteria and whose visions?

Needless to say, different communities and different regions would
choose different priorities and different lifestyles. As the CNT's
Zaragoza resolution on libertarian communism made clear, *"those
communes which reject industrialisation . . . may agree upon a different
model of co-existence."* Using the example of *"naturists and nudists,"*
it argued that they *"will be entitled to an autonomous administration
released from the general commitments"* agreed by the communes and their
federations and *"their delegates to congresses of the . . .
Confederation of Autonomous Libertarian Communes will be empowered to
enter into economic contacts with other agricultural and industrial
Communes."* [quoted by Jose Peirats, **The CNT in the Spanish
Revolution**, vol. 1, p. 106]

For most anarchists, though, technological advancement is important in a
free society in order to maximise the free time available for everyone
and replace mindless toil with meaningful work. The means of doing so is
the use of **appropriate** technology (and **not** the worship of
technology as such). Only by critically evaluating technology and
introducing such forms which empower, are understandable and are
controllable by individuals and communities as well as minimising
ecological distribution can this be achieved. Only this critical
approach to technology can do justice to the power of the human mind and
reflect the creative powers which developed the technology in the first
place. Unquestioning acceptance of technological progress is just as bad
as being unquestioningly anti-technology.

I.4.10 What would be the advantage of a wide basis of surplus distribution?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

We noted earlier (in [section I.3.1](secI3.html#seci31)) that
competition between syndicates could lead to *"co-operative egotism"*
(to use Kropotkin's term) and that to eliminate this problem, the basis
of collectivisation needs to be widened so that production is based on
need and, as a result, surpluses are distributed society-wide. The
advantage of a wide surplus distribution is that it allows all to have a
decent life and stop market forces making people work harder and longer
to survive in the economy (see [section I.1.3](secI1.html#seci13)). The
consolidation of syndicates that would otherwise compete will, it is
hoped, lead to a more efficient allocation of resources and technical
improvements so allowing the transformation of work and reduction of the
time we need to spend in production. We will back up this claim with
illustrations from the Spanish Revolution as well as from today's
system.

Collectivisation in Catalonia embraced not only major industries like
municipal transportation and utilities, but smaller establishments as
well: small factories, artisan workshops, service and repair shops, etc.
Augustin Souchy describes the process as follows:

> *"The artisans and small workshop owners, together with their
> employees and apprentices, often joined the union of their trade. By
> consolidating their efforts and pooling their resources on a fraternal
> basis, the shops were able to undertake very big projects and provide
> services on a much wider scale . . . The collectivisation of the
> hairdressing shops provides an excellent example of how the transition
> of a small-scale manufacturing and service industry from capitalism to
> socialism was achieved . . .*

> *"Before July 19th, 1936 [the date of the Revolution], there were
> 1,100 hairdressing parlours in Barcelona, most of them owned by poor
> wretches living from hand to mouth. The shops were often dirty and
> ill-maintained. The 5,000 hairdressing assistants were among the most
> poorly paid workers . . . Both owners and assistants therefore
> voluntarily decided to socialise all their shops.*

> *"How was this done? All the shops simply joined the union. At a
> general meeting they decided to shut down all the unprofitable shops.
> The 1,100 shops were reduced to 235 establishments, a saving of
> 135,000 pesetas per month in rent, lighting, and taxes. The remaining
> 235 shops were modernised and elegantly outfitted. From the money
> saved, wages were increased by 40%. Everyone having the right to work
> and everyone received the same wages. The former owners were not
> adversely affected by socialisation. They were employed at a steady
> income. All worked together under equal conditions and equal pay. The
> distinction between employers and employees was obliterated and they
> were transformed into a working community of equals -- socialism from
> the bottom up."* [**The Anarchist Collectives**, Sam Dolgoff (ed.),
> pp. 93-94]

The collectives, as well as improving working conditions, also ensured
access to other goods and services which market forces had previously
denied working class people. Across Republican Spain collectives in
towns and villages organised health care. For example, in the village of
Magdalena de Pulpis housing *"was free and completely socialised, as was
medical care . . . Medicines, supplies, transfer to hospitals in
Barcelona or Castellon, surgery, services of specialists -- all was paid
for by the collective."* This was also done for education, with
collectives forming and running schools, colleges and universities. For
example, Regional Peasant Federation of Levant saw each collective
organise *"one or two free schools for the children"* and *"almost wiped
out illiteracy"* (over 70% of rural Spain was literate before the Civil
War). It also organised a *"University of Moncada"* which *"gave courses
in animal husbandry, poultry raising. animal breeding, agriculture, tree
science, etc."* [Gaston Leval, **Op. Cit.**, p. 156 and p. 125]

These examples, social anarchists argue, show that co-operation ensures
that resources are efficiently allocated and waste is minimised by
cutting down needless competition. It also ensures that necessary goods
and services which meet vital areas for human well-being and development
are available for all rather than the few. Rather than reduce choice,
such co-operation increased it by making such things available to all
(and as consumers have choices in which syndicate to consume from as
well as having direct communication between consumer co-operatives and
productive units, there is little danger that rationalisation in
production will hurt the interests of the consumer).

Another way in which wide distribution of surplus can be advantageous is
in Research and Development (R&D). By creating a fund for research and
development which is independent of the fortunes of individual
syndicates, society as a whole can be improved by access to useful new
technologies and processes. Therefore, in a libertarian socialist
society, people (both within the workplace and in communities) are
likely to decide to allocate significant amounts of resources for basic
research from the available social output. This is because the results
of this research would be freely available to all and so would aid
everyone in the long term. In addition, because workers directly control
their workplace and the local community effectively "owns" it, all
affected would have an interest in exploring research which would reduce
labour, pollution, waste and so on or increase output with little or no
social impact.

It should also be mentioned here that research would be pursued more and
more as people take an increased interest in both their own work and
education. As people become liberated from the grind of everyday life,
they will explore possibilities as their interests take them and so
research will take place on many levels within society - in the
workplace, in the community, in education and so on.

This means that research and innovation would be in the direct interests
of everyone involved and that all would have the means to do it. Under
capitalism, this is not the case. Most research is conducted in order to
get an edge in the market by increasing productivity or expanding
production into new (previously unwanted) areas. Any increased
productivity often leads to unemployment, deskilling and other negative
effects for those involved. Libertarian socialism will not face this
problem. Moreover, it should be stressed that basic research is not
something which free-market capitalism does well. As Doug Henwood notes,
basic science research *"is heavily funded by the public sector and
non-profit institutions like universities."* The internet and computer,
for example, were both projects for the Pentagon and *"the government
picked up the basic R&D tab for decades, when neither Wall Street nor
private industry showed any interest. In fact, capital only became
interested when the start-up costs had all been borne by the public
sector and there were finally profits to be made . . . good American
individualists don't like to talk about the public sector, since their
hero is the plucky entrepreneur."* [**After the New Economy**, p. 196
and p. 6] The rise of such systems across the world indicates that basic
research often needs public support in order to be done. Even such a
leading neo-classical economist as Kenneth Arrow had to admit in the
1960s that market forces are insufficient:

> *"basic research, the output of which is only used as an informational
> input into other inventive activities, is especially unlikely to be
> rewarded. In fact, it is likely to be of commercial value to the firm
> undertaking it only if other firms are prevented from using the
> information. But such restriction reduces the efficiency of inventive
> activity in general, and will therefore reduce its quantity also."*
> [quoted by David Schweickart, **Against capitalism**, p. 132]

Nothing has changed since. Would modern society have produced so many
innovations if it had not been for the Pentagon system, the space race
and so on? Take the Internet, for example -- it is unlikely that this
would have got off the ground if it had not been for public funding.
Needless to say, of course, much of this technology has been developed
for evil reasons and purposes and would be in need of drastic change
(or, in many some, abolition) before it could be used in a libertarian
society. However, the fact remains that it is unlikely that a pure
market based system could have generated most of the technology we take
for granted. As Noam Chomsky argues:

The free market can also have a negative impact on innovation. This is
because, in order to please shareholders with higher share prices,
companies may reduce funds available for real investment as well as R&D
which would also depress growth and employment in the long term. What
shareholders might condemn as "uneconomic" (investment projects and R&D)
can, and does, make society as a whole better off. However, these gains
are over the long term and, within capitalism, it is short-term gains
which count. Higher share prices in the here and now are essential in
order to survive and so see the long-run.

A socialised economy with a wide-scale sharing of surpluses and
resources could easily allocate resources for R&D, long term investment,
innovation and so on. Via the use of mutual banks or confederations of
syndicates and communes, resources could be allocated which take into
account the importance of long-term priorities, as well as social costs,
which are not taken into account (indeed, are beneficial to ignore)
under capitalism. Rather than penalise long term investment and research
and development, a socialised economy would ensure that adequate
resources are available, something which would benefit everyone in
society in some way.

If we look at vocational training and education, a wide basis of surplus
distribution would aid this no end. Under free market capitalism,
vocational training suffers for profit seeking firms will not incur
costs that will be enjoyed by others. This means that firms will be
reluctant to spend money on training if they fear that the trained
workers will soon be poached by other firms which can offer more money
because they had not incurred the cost of providing training. As a
result few firms will provide the required training as they could not be
sure that the trained workers will not leave for their competitors (and,
of course, a trained work force also, due to their skill, have more
workplace power and are less replaceable). So as well as technological
developments, a wide basis of surplus distribution would help improve
the skills and knowledge of the members of a community. As Keynesian
economist Michael Stewart points out, *"[t]here are both theoretical and
empirical reasons to suppose that market forces under-provide research
and development expenditures, as well as both education and training."*
[**Keynes in the 1990s**, p. 77]

By socialising training via confederations of workplaces, syndicates
could increase productivity via increasing the skill levels of their
members. Higher skill levels will also tend to increase innovation and
enjoyment at "work" when combined with workers' self-management. This is
because an educated workforce in control of their own time will be
unlikely to tolerate mundane, boring, machine-like work and seek ways to
eliminate it, improve the working environment and increase productivity
to give them more free time.

In addition to work conducted by syndicates, education establishments,
communes and so on, it would be essential to provide resources for
individuals and small groups to pursue "pet projects." Of course,
syndicates and confederations will have their own research institutions
but the innovatory role of the interested "amateur" cannot be
over-rated. As Kropotkin argued:

> *"What is needed to promote the spirit of innovation is . . . the
> awakening of thought, the boldness of conception, which our entire
> education causes to languish; it is the spreading of a scientific
> education, which would increase the numbers of inquirers a
> hundred-fold; it is faith that humanity is going to take a step
> forward, because it is enthusiasm, the hope of doing good, that has
> inspired all the great inventors. The Social Revolution alone can give
> this impulse to thought, this boldness, this knowledge, this
> conviction of working for all.*

> *"Then we shall have vast institutes . . . immense industrial
> laboratories open to all inquirers, where men will be able to work out
> their dreams, after having acquitted themselves of their duty towards
> society; . . . where they will make their experiments; where they will
> find other comrades, experts in other branches of industry, likewise
> coming to study some difficult problem, and therefore able to help and
> enlighten each other -- the encounter of their ideas and experiences
> causing the longed-for solution to be found."* [**The Conquest of
> Bread**, p. 117]

The example of free software (operating systems, programming languages,
specific packages and code) today show the potential this. Thus
socialisation would aid innovation and scientific development by
providing the necessary resources (including free time) for such work.
Moreover, it would also provide the community spirit required to push
the boundaries of science forward. As John O'Neil argues:

> *"There is, in a competitive market economy, a disincentive to
> communicate information. The market encourages secrecy, which is
> inimical to openness in science. It presupposes a view of property in
> which the owner has rights to exclude others. In the sphere of
> science, such rights of exclusion place limits on the communication of
> information and theories which are incompatible with the growth of
> knowledge . . . science tends to grow when communication is open. . .
> [In addition a] necessary condition for the acceptability of a theory
> or experimental result is that it pass the public, critical scrutiny
> of competent scientific judges. A private theory or result is one that
> is shielded from the criteria of scientific acceptability."* [**The
> Market**, p. 153]

Today inventors often *"carefully hide their inventions from each other,
as they are hampered by patents and Capitalism -- that bane of present
society, that stumbling-block in the path of intellectual and moral
progress."* In a free society, socialisation would ensure that inventors
will be able to build upon the knowledge of everyone, including past
generations. Rather than hide knowledge from others, in case they get a
competitive advantage, knowledge would be shared, enriching all involved
as well as the rest of society. Thus the *"spreading of a scientific
education, which would increase the number of inquirers"*, *"faith that
humanity is going to take a step forward"* and the *"enthusiasm, the
hope of doing good, that has inspired all the great inventors"* will be
maximised and innovation increased. [Kropotkin, **Op. Cit.**, p. 117 and
pp. 116-7]

Social anarchists would also suggest that socialisation would produce
more benefits by looking at existing societies. The evidence from the
UK, USA, Australia, New Zealand and China shows that privatisations of
nationalised industries associated with neo-liberalism failed in its
stated aims of cheaper and better services while more than succeeding in
their unstated aim of redistributing wealth upwards (for details see
**In Government we Trust: Market Failure and the delusions of
privatisation** by Warrick Funnell, Robert Jupe and Jane Andrew). The
examples of railway and utility privatisation, the energy crisis in
California (with companies like Enron reaping huge speculative profits
while consumers faced blackouts) and the Sydney water treatment scandal
in Australia are sadly all too typical. Ironically, in the UK after 30
years of Thatcherite policies (first under the Tories and then New
Labour) the readers of the right-wing press who supported it are
subjected to article after article complaining about *"Rip off Britain"*
and yet more increases in the prices charged for privatised utilities,
services and goods. This, it must be stressed, if not to suggest that
anarchists aim for nationalisation (we do not, we aim for socialisation
and workers' self-management) but rather to indicate that privatising
resources does not benefit the majority of people in a given society.

It should also be noted that more unequal societies are bad for almost
everyone within them. Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett in their book
**The Spirit Level: Why More Equal Societies Almost Always Do Better**
show that almost every modern social and environmental problem
(including ill-health, lack of community life, violence, drugs, obesity,
mental illness, long working hours, big prison populations) is more
likely to occur in an unequal society than a more equal one. Based on
thirty years of research, it shows that inequality, as anarchists have
long argued, is bad for us. As such, socialisation of wealth would
benefit us all.

Lastly, there is the issue of those who cannot work and the general
provision of public goods. With a wide distribution to surplus, communal
hospitals, schools, universities and so on can be created. The simple
fact is that any society has members who cannot (indeed, should not)
work unless they want to, such as the young, the old and the sick. In an
Individualist Anarchist society, there is no real provision for these
individuals unless someone (a family member, friend or charity) provides
them with the money required for hospital fees and so on. For most
anarchists, such a situation seems far too much like the system we are
currently fighting against to be appealing. As such, social anarchists
argue that everyone deserves an education, health care and so on as a
right and so be able live a fully human life as a right, rather than a
privilege to be paid for. A communal basis for distribution would ensure
that every member of the commune can receive such things automatically,
as and when required. The removal of the worry that, for example,
privatised health care produces can be seen as a benefit of
socialisation which cannot be reflected in, say, GDP or similar economic
measures (not to mention the ethical statement it makes).

Significantly, though, non-privatised system of health care are more
efficient. Competition as well as denying people treatment also leads to
inefficiencies as prices are inflated to pay for advertising,
competition related administration costs, paying dividends to
share-holders and so on. This drives up the cost for those lucky enough
to be covered, not to mention the stress produced by the constant fear
of losing insurance or being denying payment due to the insurance
company deciding against the patient and their doctor. For example, in
1993, Canada's health plans devoted 0.9% of spending to overhead,
compared to U.S. figures of 3.2% for Medicare and 12% for private
insurers. In addition, when Canada adopted its publicly financed system
in 1971, it and the U.S. both spent just over 7% of GDP on health care.
By 1990, the U.S. was up to 12.3%, verses Canada's 9%. Since then costs
have continued to rise and rise, making health-care reform of key
interest to the public who are suffering under it (assuming they are
lucky enough to have private insurance, of course).

The madness of private health-care shows the benefits of a society-wide
distribution of surpluses. Competition harms health-care provision and,
as a result, people. According to Alfie Kohn:

> *"More hospitals and clinics are being run by for-profit corporations;
> many institutions, forced to battle for 'customers,' seem to value a
> skilled director of marketing more highly than a skilled caregiver. As
> in any other economic sector, the race for profits translates into

> sick than rich . . . The result: hospital costs are actually
> **higher** in areas where there is more competition for patients."*
> [**No Contest**, p. 240]

American Liberal Robert Kuttner concurs:

In 1993, the US paid 13.4% of its GDP towards health care, compared to
10% for Canada, 8.6% for Sweden and Germany, 6.6% for Britain and 6.8%
for Japan. Only 40% of the US population was covered by public health
care and over 35 million people, 14% of the population, went without
health insurance for all of 1991, and about twice that many were
uninsured for some period during the year. In terms of health
indicators, the US people are not getting value for money. Life
expectancy is higher in Canada, Sweden, Germany, Japan and Britain. The
USA has the highest levels of infant mortality and is last in basic
health indicators as well as having fewer doctors per 1,000 people than
the OECD average. All in all, the US system is miles begin the universal
systems of other countries.

Of course, it will be argued that the USA is not a pure "free market"
and so comparisons are pointless. However, it seems strange that the
more competitive system, the more privatised system, is less efficient
and less fair than the universal systems. It also seems strange that
defenders of competition happily use examples from "actually existing"
capitalism to illustrate their politics but reject negative examples as
being a product of an "impure" system. They want to have their cake and
eat it to.

Significantly, we should note that the use of surplus for communal
services (such as hospitals and education) can be seen from the Spanish
Revolution. Many collectives funded new hospitals and colleges for their
members, providing hundreds of thousands with services they could never
have afforded by their own labour. This is a classic example of
co-operation helping the co-operators achieve far more than they could
by their own isolated activities. This libertarian health system was run
and how other public services would be organised in a free society are
discussed in [section I.5.12](secI5.html#seci512).

So we can generalise from our experiences of different kinds of
capitalism. If you want to live in a society of well-educated people,
working today as equals in pleasant surroundings with more than ample
leisure time to pursue their own projects and activities, then a wide
sharing of the social surplus is required. Otherwise, you could live in
a society where people work long and hard to survive on the market,
without the time or opportunity for education and leisure, and be bossed
about for most of their waking hours to enrich the wealthy few so that
they can live a life of leisure (which, in turn, will inspire you to be
work harder in spite of the fact that such high inequality produces low
social mobility). The first society, according to some, would be one of
self-sacrificing altruism and "collectivism" while the latter is,
apparently, one based on "individualism" and self-interest...

I.4.11 If socialism eliminates the profit motive, won't performance suffer?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Firstly, just to be totally clear, by the profit motive we mean money
profit. As anarchists consider co-operation to be in our self-interest
-- i.e. we will "profit" from it in the widest sense possible -- we are
**not** dismissing the fact people usually act to improve their own
situation. However, money profit is a **very** narrow form of
"self-interest," indeed so narrow as to be positively harmful to the
individual in many ways (in terms of personal development, interpersonal
relationships, economic and social well-being, and so on). In other
words, do not take our discussion here on the "profit motive" to imply a
denial of self-interest, quite the reverse. Anarchists simply reject the
*"narrow concept of life which consist[s] in thinking that **profits**
are the only leading motive of human society."* [Peter Kropotkin,
**Fields, Factories and Workshops Tomorrow**, p. 25]

Secondly, we cannot hope to deal fully with the harmful effects of
competition and the profit motive. For more information, we recommend
Alfie Kohn's **No Contest: The Case Against Competition** and **Punished
by Rewards: The Trouble with Gold Stars, Incentive Plans, A's, Praise
and Other Bribes**. He documents the extensive evidence accumulated that
disproves the "common sense" of capitalism that competition and profits
are the best way to organise a society.

According to Kohn, a growing body of psychological research suggests
that rewards can lower performance levels, especially when the
performance involves creativity. His books summarise the related series
of studies shows which show that intrinsic interest in a task -- the
sense that something is worth doing for its own sake -- typically
declines when someone is rewarded for doing it. Much of the research on
creativity and motivation has been performed by Theresa Amabile,
associate professor of psychology at Brandeis University and she has
found consistently that those were promised rewards did the least
creative work. Thus *"rewards killed creativity, and this was true
regardless of the type of task, the type of reward, the timing of the
reward or the age of the people involved."* [**Punished by Rewards**, p.
45] Such research casts doubt on the claim that financial reward is the
only effective way -- or even the best way -- to motivate people. They
challenge the behaviourist assumption that any activity is more likely
to occur or be better in terms of outcome if it is rewarded.

These findings re-enforce the findings of other scientific fields.
Biology, social psychology, ethnology and anthropology all present
evidence that support co-operation as the natural basis for human
interaction. For example, ethnological studies indicate that virtually
all indigenous cultures operate on the basis of highly co-operative
relationships and anthropologists have presented evidence to show that
the predominant force driving early human evolution was co-operative
social interaction, leading to the capacity of hominids to develop
culture. This is even sinking into capitalism, with industrial
psychology now promoting "worker participation" and team functioning
because it is decisively more productive than hierarchical management.
More importantly, the evidence shows that co-operative workplaces are
more productive than those organised on other principles. All other
things equal, producers' co-operatives will be more efficient than
capitalist or state enterprises, on average. Co-operatives can often
achieve higher productivity even when their equipment and conditions are
worse. Furthermore, the better the organisation approximates the
co-operative ideal, the better the productivity.

All this is unsurprising to social anarchists (and it should make
individualist anarchists reconsider their position). Peter Kropotkin
argued that, *"[i]f we . . . ask Nature: 'Who are the fittest: those who
are continually at war with each other, or those who support one
another?' we at once see that those animals which acquire habits of
mutual aid are undoubtedly the fittest. They have more chances to
survive, and they attain, in their respective classes, the highest
development of intelligence and bodily organisation."* [**Mutual Aid**,
p. 24]

It should be noted that, as one biologist points out, *"Kropotkin's
ideas, though unorthodox, were scientifically respectable, and indeed
the contention that mutual aid can be a means of increasing fitness had
become a standard part of modern sociobiology."* [Douglas H. Boucher,
*"The Idea of Mutualism, Past and Future"*, pp. 1-28, **The Biology of
Mutualism: Biology and Evolution**, Douglas H. Boucher (ed.), p. 17]
Frans de Waal (a leading primatologist) and Jessica C. Flack argue that
Kropotkin is part of a wider tradition *"in which the view has been that
animals assist each other precisely because by doing so they achieve
long term, collective benefits of greater value than the short term
benefits derived from straightforward competition."* They summarise that
the *"basic tenet of [Kropotkin's] ideas was on the mark. Almost seventy
years later, in an article entitled 'The Evolution of Reciprocal
Altruism', [Robert] Trivers refined the concepts Kropotkin advanced and
explained how co-operation and, more importantly, a system of
reciprocity (called 'reciprocal altruism' by Trivers) could have
evolved."* [*"'Any Animal Whatever': Darwinian Building Blocks of
Morality in Monkeys and Apes"*, pp. 1-29, **Journal of Consciousness
Studies**, Vol. 7, No. 1-2, p. 4]

So modern research has reinforced Kropotkin's argument. This applies to
both human and non-human animals. For the former, the evidence is strong
that we have intrinsic abilities and needs to co-operate as well as an
intrinsic senses of fairness and ethics. This suggests that co-operation
is part of "human nature" and so studies which show that such behaviour
is more productive than competition should come as no surprise -- and
the evidence is impressive. As noted, Alfie Kohn is also the author of
**No Contest: The Case Against Competition** and he spent seven years
reviewing more than 400 research studies dealing with competition and
co-operation. According to Kohn, there are three principle consequences
of competition:

Firstly, it has a negative effect on productivity and excellence. This
is due to increased anxiety, inefficiency (as compared to co-operative
sharing of resources and knowledge), and the undermining of inner
motivation. Competition shifts the focus to victory over others, and
away from intrinsic motivators such as curiosity, interest, excellence,
and social interaction. Studies show that co-operative behaviour, by
contrast, consistently produces good performance -- a finding which
holds true under a wide range of subject variables. Interestingly, the
positive benefits of co-operation become more significant as tasks
become more complex, or where greater creativity and problem-solving
ability is required.

Secondly, competition lowers self-esteem and hampers the development of
sound, self-directed individuals. A strong sense of self is difficult to
attain when self-evaluation is dependent on seeing how we measure up to
others. On the other hand, those whose identity is formed in relation to
how they contribute to group efforts generally possess greater
self-confidence and higher self-esteem.

Thirdly, competition undermines human relationships. Humans are social
beings; we best express our humanness in interaction with others. By
creating winners and losers, competition is destructive to human unity
and prevents close social feeling.

Social Anarchists have long argued these points. In the competitive
mode, people work at cross purposes, or purely for (material) personal
gain. This leads to an impoverishment of society as well as hierarchy,
with a lack of communal relations that result in an impoverishment of
all the individuals involved (mentally, spiritually, ethically and,
ultimately, materially). This not only leads to a weakening of
individuality and social disruption, but also to economic inefficiency
as energy is wasted in class conflict and invested in building bigger
and better cages to protect the haves from the have-nots. Instead of
creating useful things, human activity is spent in useless toil
reproducing an injustice and authoritarian system.

All in all, the results of competition (as documented by a host of
scientific disciplines) show its poverty as well as indicating that
co-operation is the means by which the fittest survive.

Moreover, the notion that material rewards result in better work is
simply not true. Basing itself on simple behaviourist psychology, such
arguments fail to meet the test of long-term success (and, in fact, can
be counter-productive). Indeed, it means treating human beings as little
better that pets or other animals (Kohn argues that it is *"not an
accident that the theory behind 'Do this and you'll get that' derives
from work with other species, or that behaviour management is frequently
described in words better suited to animals."*) In other words, it *"is
by its very nature dehumanising."* Rather than simply being motivated by
outside stimuli like mindless robots, people are not passive. We are
*"beings who possess natural curiosity about ourselves and our
environment, who search for and overcome challenges, who try and master
skills and attain competence, and who seek new levels of complexity in
what we learn and do . . . in general we act on the environment as much
as we are acted on by it, and we do not do so simply in order to receive
a reward."* [**Punished by Rewards**, p. 24 and p. 25]

Kohn presents extensive evidence to back upon his case that rewards harm
activity and individuals. We cannot do justice to it here so we will
present a few examples. One study with college students showed that
those paid to work on a puzzle *"spent less time on it than those who
hadn't been paid"* when they were given a choice of whether to work on
it or not. *"It appeared that working for a reward made people less
interested in the task."* Another study with children showed that
*"extrinsic rewards reduce intrinsic motivation."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 70
and p. 71] Scores of other studies confirmed this. This is because a
reward is effectively saying that a given activity is not worth doing
for its own sake -- and why would anyone wish to do something they have
to be bribed to do?

In the workplace, a similar process goes on. Kohn presents extensive
evidence to show that extrinsic motivation also fails even there.
Indeed, he argues that *"economists have it wrong if they think of work
as a 'disutility' -- something unpleasant we must do in order to be able
to buy what we need, merely a means to an end."* Kohn stresses that *"to
assume that money is what drives people is to adopt an impoverished
understanding of human motivation."* Moreover, *"the risk of **any**
incentive or pay-for-performance system is that it will make people less
interested in their work and therefore less likely to approach it with
enthusiasm and a commitment to excellence. Furthermore, **the more
closely we tie compensation (or other rewards) to performance, the most
damage we do.**"* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 131, p. 134 and p. 140]

Kohn argues that the idea that humans will only work for profit or
rewards *"can be fairly described as dehumanising"* if *"the capacity
for responsible action, the natural love of learning, and the desire to
do good work are already part of who we are."* Also, it is *"a way of
trying to control people"* and so to *"anyone who is troubled by a model
of human relationships founded principally on the idea of one person
controlling another must ponder whether rewards are as innocuous as they
are sometimes made out to be"*. So *"there is no getting around the fact
that 'the basic purpose of merit pay is manipulative.' One observer more
bluntly characterises incentives as 'demeaning' since the message they
really convey is, 'Please big daddy boss and you will receive the
rewards that the boss deems appropriate.'"* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 26]

Given that much work is controlled by others and can be a hateful
experience under capitalism does not mean that it has to be that way.
Clearly, even under wage slavery most workers can and do find work
interesting and seek to do it well -- not because of possible rewards or
punishment but because we seek meaning in our activities and try and do
them well. Given that research shows that reward orientated work
structures harm productivity and excellence, social anarchists have more
than just hope to base their ideas. Such research confirms Kropotkin's
comments:

> *"Wage-work is serf-work; it cannot, it must not, produce all it could
> produce. And it is high time to disbelieve the legend which presents

For these reasons, social anarchists are confident that the elimination
of the profit motive within the context of self-management will not harm
productivity and creativity, but rather **enhance** them (within an
authoritarian system in which workers enhance the power and income of
bureaucrats, we can expect different results). With the control of their
own work and workplaces ensured, all working people can express their
abilities to the full. This will see an explosion of creativity and
initiative, not a reduction.

I.4.12 Won't there be a tendency for capitalist enterprise to reappear?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a common right-wing "libertarian" objection. Robert Nozick, for
example, imagined the following scenario:

> *"small factories would spring up in a socialist society, unless
> forbidden. I melt some of my personal possessions and build a machine
> out of the material. I offer you and others a philosophy lecture once
> a week in exchange for yet other things, and so on . . . some persons
> might even want to leave their jobs in socialist industry and work
> full time in this private sector . . . [This is] how private property
> even in means of production would occur in a socialist society . . .
> [and so] the socialist society will have to forbid capitalist acts
> between consenting adults."* [**Anarchy, State and Utopia**, pp.
> 162-3]

There are numerous flawed assumptions in this argument and we will
discuss them here. The key flaws are the confusion of exchange with
capitalism and the typically impoverished propertarian vision that
freedom is, essentially, the freedom to sell your liberty, to become a
wage slave and so unfree. Looking at history, we can say that both these
assumptions are wrong. Firstly, while markets and exchange have existed
for thousands of years capitalism has not. Wage-labour is a relatively
recent development and has been the dominant mode of production for, at
best, a couple of hundred years. Secondly, few people (when given the
choice) have freely become wage-slaves. Just as the children of slaves
often viewed slavery as the "natural" order, so do current workers. Yet,
as with chattel slavery, substantial state coercion was required to
achieve such a "natural" system.

As discussed in [section F.8](secF8.html), actually existing capitalism
was **not** created by Nozick's process -- it required substantial state
intervention to separate workers from the means of production they used
and to ensure, eventually, that the situation in which they sold their
liberty to the property owner was considered "natural." Without that
coercion, people do **not** seek to sell their liberty to others. Murray
Bookchin summarised the historical record by noting that in *"every
precapitalist society, countervailing forces . . . existed to restrict
the market economy. No less significantly, many precapitalist societies
raised what they thought were insuperable obstacles to the penetration
of the State into social life."* He pointed to *"the power of village
communities to resist the invasion of trade and despotic political forms
into society's abiding communal substrate."* [**The Ecology of
Freedom**, pp. 207-8] Anarchist anthropologist David Graeber notes that
in the ancient Mediterranean world *"[w]hile one does periodically run
into evidence of arrangements which to the modern eye look like
wage-labour contracts, on closer examination they almost always actually
turn out to be contracts to rent slaves . . . Free men and women thus
avoided anything remotely like wage-labour, seeing it as a matter,
effectively, of slavery, renting themselves out."* This means that wage
labour *"(as opposed to, say, receiving fees for professional services)
involves a degree of subordination: a labourer has to be to some degree
at the command of his or her employer. This is exactly why, through most
of history, free men and women tended to avoid wage-labour, and why, for
most of history, capitalism . . . never emerged."* [**Possibilities**,
p. 92]

Thus while the idea that people will happily become wage slaves may be
somewhat common place today (particularly with supporters of capitalism)
the evidence of history is that people, given a choice, will prefer
self-employment and **resist** wage labour (often to the death). As E.
P. Thompson noted, for workers at the end of the 18th and beginning of
the 19th centuries, the *"gap in status between a 'servant,' a hired
wage-labourer subject to the orders and discipline of the master, and an
artisan, who might 'come and go' as he pleased, was wide enough for men
to shed blood rather than allow themselves to be pushed from one side to
the other. And, in the value system of the community, those who resisted
degradation were in the right."* [**The Making of the English Working
Class**, p. 599] Over one hundred years later, the rural working class
of Aragon showed the same dislike of wage slavery. After Communist
troops destroyed their self-managed collectives, the *"[d]ispossessed
peasants, intransigent collectivists, refused to work in a system of
private property, and were even less willing to rent out their labour."*
[Jose Peirats, **Anarchists in the Spanish Revolution**, p. 258] The
rural economy collapsed as the former collectivists refused to be the
servants of the few.

People who have tasted freedom are unlikely to go back to oppression.
Therefore, any perception that people will become wage-slaves through
choice in a free society is based on the assumption what people accept
through necessity under capitalism will pass over, without change, into
a free one. This assumption is unfounded and anarchists expect that once
people struggle for freedom and taste the pleasures of freedom they will
not freely accept a degradation back to having a master -- and as
history shows, we have some evidence to support our argument. It seems a
strangely debased perspective on freedom to ponder whether people will
be "free" to alienate their freedom -- it is a bit like proclaiming it a
restriction of freedom to *"forbid"* owning slaves (and, as noted in
[section F.2.2](secF2.html#secf22), Nozick did support voluntary slave
contracts).

So anarchists think Nozick's vision of unfreedom developing from freedom
is unlikely. As anarcho-syndicalist Jeff Stein points out *"the only
reason workers want to be employed by capitalists is because they have
no other means for making a living, no access to the means of production
other than by selling themselves. For a capitalist sector to exist there
must be some form of private ownership of productive resources, and a
scarcity of alternatives. The workers must be in a condition of economic
desperation for them to be willing to give up an equal voice in the
management of their daily affairs and accept a boss."* [*"Market
Anarchism? Caveat Emptor!"*, **Libertarian Labour Review**, no. 13]

In an anarchist society, there is no need for anyone to *"forbid"*
capitalist acts. All people have to do is **refrain** from helping
would-be capitalists set up monopolies of productive assets. This is
because, as we have noted in [section B.3.2](secB3.html#secb32),
capitalism cannot exist without some form of state to protect such
monopolies. In a libertarian-socialist society, of course, there would
be no state to begin with, and so there would be no question of it
"refraining" people from doing anything, including protecting would-be
capitalists' monopolies of the means of production. In other words,
would-be capitalists would face stiff competition for workers in an
anarchist society. This is because self-managed workplaces would be able
to offer workers more benefits (such as self-government, better working
conditions, etc.) than the would-be capitalist ones. The would-be
capitalists would have to offer not only excellent wages and conditions
but also, in all likelihood, workers' control and hire-purchase on
capital used. The chances of making a profit once the various monopolies
associated with capitalism are abolished are slim.

Thus the would-be capitalist would *"not [be] able to obtain assistance
or people to exploit"* and *"would find none because nobody, having a
right to the means of production and being free to work on his own or as
an equal with others in the large organisations of production would want
to be exploited by a small employer"*. [Malatesta, **Errico Malatesta:
His Life and Ideas**, pp. 102-103] So where would the capitalist wannabe
find people to work for him? As Kropotkin argued:

> *"Everywhere you will find that the wealth of the wealthy springs from
> the poverty of the poor. That is why an anarchist society need not
> fear the advent of a [millionaire] who would settle in its midst. If
> every member of the community knows that after a few hours of
> productive toil he [or she] will have a right to all the pleasures
> that civilisation procures, and to those deeper sources of enjoyment
> which art and science offer to all who seek them, he [or she] will not
> sell his strength . . . No one will volunteer to work for the
> enrichment of your [millionaire]."* [**Conquest of Bread**, p. 61]

However, let us suppose there is a self-employed inventor, Ferguson, who
comes up with a new innovation without the help of the socialised
sector. Would anarchists steal his idea? Not at all. The syndicates,
which by hypothesis have been organised by people who believe in giving
producers the full value of their product, would pay Ferguson an
equitable amount for his idea, which would then become common across
society. However, if he refused to sell his invention and instead tried
to claim a patent monopoly on it in order to gather a group of wage
slaves to exploit, no one would agree to work for him unless they got
the full control over both the product of their labour and the labour
process itself. And, assuming that he did find someone willing to work
for him (and so be governed by him), the would-be capitalist would have
to provide such excellent conditions and pay such good wages as to
reduce his profits to near zero. Moreover, he would have to face workers
whose neighbours would be encouraging them to form a union and strike
for even **better** conditions and pay, including workers' control and
so on. Such a militant workforce would be the last thing a capitalist
would desire. In addition, we would imagine they would also refuse to
work for someone unless they also got the capital they used at the end
of their contract (i.e. a system of "hire-purchase" on the means of
production used). In other words, by removing the statist supports of
capitalism, would-be capitalists would find it hard to "compete" with
the co-operative sector and would not be in a position to exploit
others' labour.

With a system of communal production (in social anarchism) and mutual
banks (in individualist anarchism), **usury** -- i.e. charging a use-fee
for a monopolised item, of which patents are an instance -- would no
longer be possible and the inventor would be like any other worker,
exchanging the product of his or her labour. As Benjamin Tucker argued,
*"the patent monopoly . . . consists in protecting inventors and authors
against competition for a period of time long enough for them to extort
from the people a reward enormously in excess of the labour measure of
their services -- in other words, in giving certain people a right of
property for a term of years in laws and facts of nature, and the power
to extract tribute from others for the use of this natural wealth, which
should be open to all. The abolition of this monopoly would fill its
beneficiaries with a wholesome fear of competition which should cause
them to be satisfied with pay for their services equal to that which
other labourers get for theirs, and secure it by placing their products
and works on the market at the outset at prices so low that their lines
of business would be no more tempting to competitors than any other
lines."* [**The Anarchist Reader**, pp. 150-1]

So, if someone has labour to sell then they deserve a free society to do
it in -- as Tucker once pointed out. Such an environment would make the
numbers seeking employment so low as to ensure that the rate of
exploitation would be zero. Little wonder that, when faced with a
self-employed, artisan workforce, capitalists have continually turned to
the state to create the "correct" market forces. So without statism to
back up various class-based monopolies of capitalist privilege,
capitalism would not have become dominant.

It should also be noted that Nozick makes a serious error in his case.
He assumes that the "use rights" associated with an anarchist (i.e.
socialist) society are identical to the "property rights" of a
capitalist one. This is **not** the case, and so his argument is
weakened and loses its force. Simply put, there is no such thing as an
absolute or *"natural"* law of property. As John Stuart Mill pointed
out, *"powers of exclusive use and control are very various, and differ
greatly in different countries and in different states of society."*
Therefore, Nozick slips an ideological ringer into his example by
erroneously interpreting socialism (or any other society for that
matter) as specifying a distribution of capitalist property rights along
with the wealth. As Mill argued: *"One of the mistakes oftenest
committed, and which are the sources of the greatest practical errors in
human affairs, is that of supposing that the same name always stands for
the same aggregation of ideas. No word has been subject of more of this
kind of misunderstanding that the word property."* [*"Chapters on
Socialism,"* **Principles of Political Economy**, p. 432]

In other words, Nozick assumes that in **all** societies capitalist
property rights are distributed along with consumption **and**
production goods. As Cheyney C. Ryan comments *"[d]ifferent conceptions
of justice differ not only in how they would apportion society's
holdings but in what rights individuals have over their holdings once
they have been apportioned."* [*"Property Rights and Individual
Liberty"*, pp. 323-43, **Reading Nozick**, Jeffrey Paul (Ed.), p. 331]
This means that when goods are distributed in a libertarian socialist
society the people who receive or take them have specific (use) rights
to them. As long as an individual remained a member of a commune and
abided by the rules they helped create in that commune then they would
have full use of the resources of that commune and could use their
possessions as they saw fit (even *"melt them down"* to create a new
machine, or whatever). If they used those goods to create an enterprise
to employ (i.e., exploit and oppress) others then they have, in effect,
announced their withdrawal from civilised society and, as a result,
would be denied the benefits of co-operation. They would, in effect,
place themselves in the same situation as someone who does not wish to
join a syndicate (see [section I.3.7](secI3.html#seci37)). If an
individual did desire to use resources to employ wage labour then they
would have effectively removed themselves from *"socialist society"* and
so that society would bar them from using **its** resources (i.e. they
would have to buy access to all the resources they currently took for
granted).

Would this be a restriction of freedom? While it may be considered so by
the impoverished definitions of capitalism, it is not. In fact, it
mirrors the situation within capitalism as what possessions someone
holds are **not** his or her property (in the capitalist sense) any more
than a company car is currently the property of the employee under
capitalism. While the employee can use the car outside of work, they
lack the "freedom" to sell it or melt it down and turn it into machines.
Such lack of **absolute** "ownership" in a free society does not reduce
liberty any more than in this case.

This point highlights another flaw in Nozick's argument. If his argument
were true, then it applies equally to capitalist society. For 40 hours
plus a week, workers are employed by a boss. In that time they are given
resources to use and they are most definitely **not** allowed to melt
down these resources to create a machine or use the resources they have
been given access to further their own plans. This can apply equally to
rented accommodation as well, for example when landlords ban working
from home or selling off the furniture that is provided. Thus,
ironically, *"capitalist society will have to forbid capitalist acts
between consenting adults"* -- and does so all the time.

Moreover, it must be stressed that as well as banning capitalist acts
between consenting adults, capitalism involves the continual banning of
socialist acts between consenting adults. For example, if workers agree
to form a union, then the boss can fire them. If they decide to control
their own work, the boss can fire them for not obeying orders. Thus
capitalism forbids such elemental freedoms as association and speech --
at least for the majority, for the wage slaves. Why would people seek
such "freedom" in a free society?

Of course, Nozick's reply to this point would be that the individual's
involved have "consented" to these rules when they signed their
contract. Yet the same can be said of an anarchist society -- it is
freely joined and freely left. To join a communist-anarchist society it
would simply be a case of agreeing to "exchange" the product of ones
labour freely with the other members of that society and not to create
oppressive or exploitation social relationships within it. If this is
"authoritarian" then so is capitalism -- and we must stress that at
least anarchist associations are based on self-management and so the
individuals involved have an equal say in the obligations they live
under.

Notice also that Nozick confused exchange with capitalism (*"I offer you
a lecture once a week in exchange for other things"*). This is a telling
mistake by someone who claims to be an expert on capitalism, because the
defining feature of capitalism is not exchange (which obviously took
place long before capitalism existed) but labour contracts involving
wage labour. Nozick's example is merely a direct labour contract between
the producer and the consumer. It does not involve wage labour, what
makes capitalism capitalism. It is only this latter type of transaction
that libertarian socialism prevents -- and not by "forbidding" it but
simply by refusing to maintain the conditions necessary for it to occur,
i.e. protection of capitalist property.

In addition, we must note that Nozick also confused *"private property
in the means of production"* with capitalism. Liberation socialism can
be easily compatible with *"private property in the means of
production"* when that *"private property"* is limited to what a
self-employed worker uses rather than capitalistic property (see
[section G.2.1](secG2.html#secg21)). Nozick, in other words, confused
pre-capitalist forms of production with capitalist ones (see [section
G.1.2](secG1.html#secg12)). Thus possession of the means of production
by people outside of the free commune is perfectly acceptable to social
anarchists (see [section I.6.2](secI6.html#seci62)).

Thus an anarchist society would have a flexible approach to Nozick's
(flawed) argument. Individuals, in their free time, could *"exchange"*
their time and possessions as they saw fit. These are **not**
*"capitalist acts"* regardless of Nozick's claims. However, the moment
an individual employs wage labour then, by this act, they have broken
their agreements with their fellows and, therefore, no longer part of
*"socialist society."* This would involve them no longer having access
to the benefits of communal life and to communal possessions. They have,
in effect, placed themselves outside of their community and must fair
for themselves. After all, if they desire to create *"private property"*
(in the capitalist sense) then they have no right of access to communal
possessions without paying for that right. For those who become wage
slaves, a socialist society would, probably, be less strict. As Bakunin
argued:

> *"Since the freedom of every individual is inalienable, society shall
> never allow any individual whatsoever legally to alienate his [or her]
> freedom or engage upon any contract with another on any footing but
> the utmost equality and reciprocity. It shall not, however, have the
> power to disbar a man or woman so devoid of any sense of personal
> dignity as to contract a relationship of voluntary servitude with
> another individual, but it will consider them as living off private
> charity and therefore unfit to enjoy political rights **throughout the
> duration of that servitude.**"* [**Michael Bakunin: Selected
> Writings**, pp. 68-9]

Lastly, we must also note that Nozick also ignored the fact that
acquisition **must** come before transfer, meaning that before
"consenting" capitalist acts occur, individual ones must precede it. As
argued in [section B.3.4](secB3.html#secb34), Nozick provided no
convincing arguments why natural resources held in common can be
appropriated by individuals. This means that his defence of transferring
absolute capitalist property rights in goods is without foundations.
Moreover, his argument in favour of such appropriations ignore that
liberties are very definitely restricted by private property (and it
should be keep in mind that the destruction of commonly held resources,
such as village commons, was imposed by the state -- see [section
F.8.3](secF8.html#secf83)). As pointed out in [section F.2](secF2.html),
right-wing "libertarians" would better be termed *"Propertarians"* (why
is liberty according a primary importance when arguing against socialism
but not when private property restricts liberty?). As Cheyney C. Ryan
points out, Nozick *"invoke[s] personal liberty as the decisive ground
for rejecting patterned principles of justice [such as socialism] and
restrictions on the ownership of capital . . . [b]ut where the rights of
private property admittedly restrict the liberties of the average
person, he seems perfectly happy to **trade off** such liberties against
material gain for society as a whole."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 339] This can
be seen by his lack of comment on how capitalism forbids socialist acts
between consenting adults, not to mention quite a few numerous
capitalist acts for good measure.

Thus Nozick's acquisition of resources is based on the would-be
capitalist stealing communally owned resources and barring others from
using them. This obviously would restrict the liberty of those who
currently used them and so be hotly opposed by members of a community.
As Murray Bookchin noted, a free society is based on *"the practice of
**usufruct**, the freedom of individuals in a community to appropriate
resources merely by virtue of the fact that they are using them. Such
resources belong to the user as long as they are being used."* [**The
Ecology of Freedom**, p. 116] As the would-be capitalist is not actually
using the machines they have created, they would be in constant worry
that their wage-slaves would simply expropriate them -- with the full
backing of the local commune and its federations.

So, to conclude, this question involves some strange logic (and many
question begging assumptions) and ultimately fails in its attempt to
prove libertarian socialism must *"forbid capitalistic acts between
individuals."* In addition, Nozick cannot support the creation of
private property out of communal property in the first place. It also
undermines capitalism because that system must forbid socialistic acts
by and between individuals. Thus Nozick's society would forbid squatting
unused property or trespassing on private property as well as, say, the
formation of unions against the wishes of the property owner (who is
sovereign over their property and those who use it) or the use of
workplace resources to meet the needs of the producer rather than the
owner. As such, Nozick exposes how capitalism's hierarchical nature
means that capitalist society *"forbids socialist acts between
consenting adults."*

I.4.13 Who will do the dirty or unpleasant work?
------------------------------------------------

This problem affects every society, including capitalism of course.
Under capitalism, this problem is "solved" by ensuring that such jobs
are done by those at the bottom of the social pile. In other words, it
does not really solve the problem at all -- it just ensures that some
people are subject to this work the bulk of their working lives. Most
anarchists reject this flawed solution in favour of something better,
one that shares the good with the bad and so ensure everyone's life is
better. How this would be done depends on the kind of libertarian
community you are a member of.

Obviously, few would argue against the idea that individuals will
voluntarily work at things they enjoyed doing. However there are some
jobs that few, if any, would enjoy (for example, collecting rubbish,
processing sewage, dangerous work, etc.). So how would an anarchist
society deal with it?

It is obvious that not all "jobs" are equal in interest or enjoyment. It
is sometimes argued that people would start to join or form syndicates
which are involved in more fun activities. By this process excess
workers would be found in the more enjoyable "jobs" while the boring and
dangerous ones would suffer from a scarcity of willing workers. Hence,
so the argument goes, a socialist society would have to force people to
do certain jobs and that requires a state. Obviously, this argument
ignores the fact that under capitalism usually it is the boring,
dangerous work which is the least well paid with the worse working
conditions. In addition, this argument ignores the fact that under
workers self-management boring, dangerous work would be minimised and
transformed as much as possible. Only under capitalist hierarchy are
people in no position to improve the quality of their work and working
environment. As George Barrett argued:

> *"Now things are so strangely organised at present that it is just the
> dirty and disagreeable work that men will do cheaply, and consequently
> there is no great rush to invent machines to take their place. In a
> free society, on the other hand, it is clear that the disagreeable
> work will be one of the first things that machinery will be called
> upon to eliminate. It is quite fair to argue, therefore, that the
> disagreeable work will, to a large extent, disappear in a state of
> anarchism."* [**Objections to Anarchism**, p. 361]

Moreover, most anarchists would think that the argument that there would
be a flood of workers taking up "easy" work placements is abstract and
ignores the dynamics of a real society. While many individuals would try
to create new productive syndicates in order to express themselves in
innovative work outwith the existing research and development going on
within existing syndicates, the idea that the majority of individuals
would leave their current work at a drop of a hat is crazy. A workplace
is a community and part of a community and people would value the links
they have with their fellow workers. As such they would be aware of the
impacts of their decisions on both themselves and society as a whole.
So, while we would expect a turnover of workers between syndicates, the
mass transfers claimed in this argument are unlikely. Most workers who
did want to try their hand at new work would apply for work places at
syndicates that required new people, not create their own ones. Because
of this, work transfers would be moderate and easily handled.

However, the possibility of mass desertions does exist and so must be
addressed. So how would a libertarian socialist society deal with a
majority of its workers deciding to all do interesting work, leaving the
boring and/or dangerous work undone? It, of course, depends on the type
of anarchism in question and each offers alternative ways to ensure that
individual preferences for certain types of work matches the
requirements of social demand for labour.

Under individualist anarchism and mutualism, those who desired a certain
form of work done would reach an agreement with workers or a
co-operative and pay them to do the work in question. Within a
co-operative, as Proudhon argued, a person's *"education, instruction,
and apprenticeship should . . . be so directed that, while permitting
him to do his share of unpleasant and disagreeable tasks, they may also
give variety of work and knowledge, and may assure him . . . an
encyclopaedic attitude and a sufficient income."* [**General Idea of the
Revolution**, p. 222] In terms of unpleasant tasks for other people (for
example, collecting and processing a community's rubbish) then
individuals would form co-operatives which would have to find their
place on the market and this would ensure that such work was done as
they would contract with others to provide the appropriate services.
However, this could lead to some people doing unpleasant work all the
time and so is hardly a solution. As in capitalism, we may see some
people doing terrible work because it is better than no work at all.
This is a solution few anarchists would support.

In a collectivist or communist anarchist society, such an outcome would
be avoided as far as possible. Noam Chomsky points to two possible
alternatives, one *"in which the undesired work, after the best efforts
to make it meaningful, is shared"* and another one *"where the undesired
work receives high extra pay, so that individuals voluntarily choose to
do it."* Such schemes are *"consistent with . . . anarchist principles"*
unlike the current situation where *"the undesired work is given to
wage-slaves."* [**Radical Priorities**, p. 220] Another way, somewhat
complementary to these two, would be to take a leaf from *"peasant
attitudes toward labour"* and their *"most striking feature"*, the
extent *"to which any kind of communal toil, however onerous, can be
transformed by the workers themselves into festive occasions that serve
to reinforce community ties."* [**The Ecology of Freedom**, p. 342]

It would be easy to imagine a free community sharing such tasks as
fairly as possible between a community's members by, for example,
allocating a few days a month to all fit members of a community to do
work which no one volunteers to do. This would soon ensure that it would
be done, particularly if it were part of a festival or before a party.
In this way, every one shares in the unpleasant as well as pleasant
tasks (and, of course, minimises the time any one individual has to
spend on it). Or, for tasks which are very popular, individuals would
also have to do unpleasant tasks as well. In this way, popular and
unpopular tasks could balance each other out. Or such tasks could be
rotated randomly by lottery. The possibilities are many and,
undoubtedly, a free people will try many different ones in different
areas.

Another possible solution could be to follow the ideas of Josiah Warren
and take into account the undesirability of the work when considering
the level of labour notes received or communal hours worked. In other
words, in a collectivist society the individuals who do unpleasant work
may be "rewarded" (along with social esteem) with a slightly higher pay
-- the number of labour notes, for example, for such work would be a
multiple of the standard amount, the actual figure being related to how
much supply exceeds demand (in a communist society, a similar solution
could be possible, with the number of necessary hours required by an
individual being reduced by an amount that corresponds to the
undesirability of the work involved). The actual levels of "reward"
would be determined by agreements between the syndicates. For example,
if a given type of work has 50% more people wanting to do it than
actually required, then the labour value for one hours work in this
industry would correspondingly be less than one hour. If fewer people
applied than required, then the labour value would increase, as would
holiday time, etc. For "work" placements in which supply exceeded
demand, it would be easy to arrange a work share scheme to ensure that
most people get a chance to do that kind of work (along with such
methods as increasing the value of an hour's labour, reducing holiday
allocations and such like).

In this way, "supply and demand" for workers would soon approximate each
other. In addition, a collectivist society would be better placed than
the current system to ensure work-sharing and other methods to spread
unpleasant and pleasant tasks equally around society due to its organs
of self-management and the rising social awareness via participation and
debate within those organs.

A communist-anarchist society's solution would be similar to the
collectivist one. There would still be basic agreements between its
members for work done and so for work placements with excess supply of
workers the amount of hours necessary to meet the agreed minimum would
correspondingly increase. For example, an industry with 100% excess
supply of volunteers would see its minimum requirement increase from
(say) 20 hours a week to 30 hours. An industry with less applicants than
required would see the number of required hours decrease, plus increases
in holiday time and so on. As G.D.H. Cole argued in respect of this

By these methods a balance between industrial sectors would be achieved
as individuals would balance their desire for interesting work with
their desires for free time. Over time, by using the power of
appropriate technology, even such time keeping would be minimised or
even got eliminated as society developed freely. Until such time as it
can be automated away, a free society will have to encourage people to
volunteer for "work" placements they do not particularly want to do by
these and other methods.

It will be clear what is considered unpleasant work in any society --
few people (if any) will volunteer to do it. As in any advanced society,
communities and syndicates who required extra help would inform others
of their need by the various form of media that existed. In addition, it
would be likely that each community would have a *"division of
activity"* syndicate whose work would be to distribute information about
these posts and to which members of a community would go to discover
what placements existed for the line of "work" they were interested in.
So we have a means by which syndicates and communes can ask for new
associates and the means by which individuals can discover these
placements. Obviously, some tasks will still require qualifications and
that will be taken into account when syndicates and communes "advertise"
for help.

And it is important to remember that the means of production required by
new syndicates do not fall from the sky. Other members of society will
have to work to produce the required goods. Therefore it is likely that
the syndicates and communes would agree that only a certain (maximum)
percentage of production would be allocated to start-up syndicates (as
opposed to increasing the resources of existing confederations). Such a
figure would obviously be revised periodically in order to take into
account changing circumstances. Members of the community who decide to
form syndicates for new productive tasks or syndicates which do the same
work but are independent of existing confederations would have to get
the agreement of other workers to supply them with the necessary means
of production (just as today they have to get the agreement of a bank to
receive the necessary credit to start a new business). By budgeting the
amounts available, a free society can ensure that individual desires for
specific kinds of work can be matched with the requirements of society
for useful production.

And we must point out (just to make sure we are not misunderstood) that
there will be no group of "planners" deciding which applications for
resources get accepted. Instead, individuals and associations would
apply to different production units for resources, whose workers in turn
decide whether to produce the goods requested. If it is within the
syndicate's agreed budget then it is likely that they will produce the
required materials. In this way, a communist-anarchist society will
ensure the maximum amount of economic freedom to start new syndicates
and join existing ones plus ensure that social production does not
suffer in the process.

Of course, no system is perfect -- we are sure that not everyone will be
able to do the work they enjoy the most (this is also the case under
capitalism, we may add). In an anarchist society every method of
ensuring that individuals pursue the work they are interested in would
be investigated. If a possible solution can be found, we are sure that
it will. What a free society would make sure of was that neither the
capitalist market redeveloped (which ensures that the majority are
marginalised into wage slavery) or a state socialist *"labour army"*
type allocation process developed (which would ensure that free
socialism did not remain free or socialist for long).

In this manner, anarchism will be able to ensure the principle of
voluntary labour and free association as well as making sure that
unpleasant and unwanted "work" is done. Moreover, most anarchists are
sure that in a free society such requirements to encourage people to
volunteer for unpleasant work will disappear over time as feelings of
mutual aid and solidarity become more and more common place. Indeed, it
is likely that people will gain respect for doing jobs that others might
find unpleasant and so it might become "glamorous" to do such activity.
Showing off to friends can be a powerful stimulus in doing any activity.
So anarchists would agree with Albert and Hahnel when they say that:

> *"In a society that makes every effort to depreciate the esteem that
> derives from anything other than conspicuous consumption, it is not
> surprising that great income differentials are seen as necessary to
> induce effort. But to assume that only conspicuous consumption can
> motivate people because under capitalism we have strained to make it

> people wealth is generally coveted only as a **means** of attaining
> other ends such as economic security, comfort, social esteem, respect,
> status, or power."* [**The Political Economy of Participatory
> Economics**, p. 52]

We should note here that the education syndicates would obviously take
into account the trends in "work" placement requirements when deciding
upon the structure of their classes. In this way, education would
respond to the needs of society as well as the needs of the individual
(as would any productive syndicate).

I.4.14 What about the person who will not work?
-----------------------------------------------

Anarchism is based on voluntary labour. If people do not desire to work
then they cannot (must not) be forced to by means of physical coercion.
This makes some wonder what happens if someone refuses to work in a
libertarian society.

In terms of a mutualist or collectivist anarchy, this question is easy
to answer for goods are distributed according to work done and so if
people do not work then they are left dependent on the charity of those
who do (exceptions for the young, old and ill would apply, of course).

So this question is directed towards communist-anarchists, with many
people arguing that communism is impossible because people simply would
not work unless they get paid. This ignores the many people who do
volunteer work (often in addition to their "real jobs"). It also ignores
those who spend their time contributing to projects they are interested
in (such as fan journals) which would be considered work in other
contexts. A classic example of this is the internet, particularly
webpages like Wikipedia and software projects like php. Then there is
the activity of the pro-capitalists themselves, often fanatical
anti-communists (which they almost always equate to Stalinism), who
spend their free time working on wikipedia, newsgroups, webpages and
journals explaining how communism could not work because people would
never voluntarily contribute to society! It is one of the great ironies
of life that those who hate communism the most often, by their actions,
prove its viability.

So, communist-anarchists argue, in a society based on self-managed work
in pleasant surroundings and a reduction of the working week to a
minimum, there would be few people who refuse to do any kind of
productive activity. The question arises of what to do with those (a
small minority, to be sure) who refuse to work.

On this question there is some disagreement. Some anarchists argue that
the lazy should not be deprived of the means of life. Social pressure,
they argue, would ensure those who take from, but do not contribute, to
the community to listen to their conscience and start producing for the
community that supports them. If this did not happen, then the person
who refused to contribute would be asked to leave (freedom of
association means the freedom **not** to associate). As Kropotkin
argued;

> *"First of all, is it not evident that if a society, founded on the
> principle of free work, were really menaced by loafers, it could
> protect itself without the authoritarian organisation we have
> nowadays, and without having recourse to wagedom [i.e., payment by
> deeds]?*

> *"Let us take a group of volunteers, combining for some particular
> enterprise. Having its success at heart, they all work with a will,
> save one of the associates, who is frequently absent from his post . .
> . some day the comrade who imperils their enterprise will be told:
> 'Friend, we should like to work with you; but as you are often absent
> from your post, and you do your work negligently, we must part. Go and
> find other comrades who will put up with your indifference!'*

> *"This is so natural that it is practised everywhere, even nowadays,
> in all industries . . . [I]f [a worker] does his work badly, if he
> hinders his comrades by his laziness or other defects, if he is
> quarrelsome, there is an end of it; he is compelled to leave the
> workshop.*

> *"Authoritarians pretend that it is the almighty employer and his
> overseers who maintain regularity and quality of work in factories. In
> reality . . . it is the factory itself, the workmen [and women] who
> see to the good quality of the work."* [**The Conquest of Bread**, pp.
> 152-3]

Most anarchists agree with Camillo Berneri when he argued that anarchism
should be based upon *"no compulsion to work, but no duty towards those
who do not want to work."* [*"The Problem of Work"*, pp. 59-82, **Why
Work?**, Vernon Richards (ed.), p. 74] This means that an anarchist
society will not continue to feed, clothe, house someone who can produce
but refuses to. Anarchists have had enough of the wealthy under
capitalism consuming but not producing and do not see why they should
support a new group of parasites after the revolution.

Obviously, there is a difference between not wanting to work and being
unable to work. The sick, children, the old, pregnant women and so on
will be looked after in libertarian communism. As child rearing would be
considered "work" along with other more obviously economic tasks,
mothers and fathers will not have to leave their children unattended and
work to make ends meet. Instead, consideration will be given to the
needs of both parents and children as well as the creation of community
nurseries and child care centres.

We have to stress here that an anarchist society will not deny anyone
the means of life. This would violate the voluntary labour which is at
the heart of all schools of anarchism. Unlike capitalism, the means of
life will not be monopolised by any group -- including the commune. This
means that someone who does not wish to join a commune or who does not
pull their weight within a commune and are expelled or choose to leave
will have access to the means of making a living.

We stated that we stress this fact as many supporters of capitalism seem
to be unable to understand this point (or prefer to ignore it and so
misrepresent the anarchist position). In an anarchist society, no one
will be forced to join a commune simply because they do not have access
to the means of production and/or land required to work alone. Unlike
capitalism, where access to these essentials of life is dependent on
buying access to them from the capitalist class (and so, effectively,
denied to the vast majority), an anarchist society will ensure that all
have access and have a real choice between living in a commune and
working independently. This access is based on the fundamental
difference between possession and property -- the commune possesses as
much land as it needs, as do non-members. The resources used by them are
subject to the usual possession rationale -- they possess it only as
long as they use it and cannot bar others using it if they do not (i.e.,
it is not property).

Thus an anarchist commune remains a voluntary association and ensures
the end of all forms of domination. The member of the commune has the
choice of working as part of a community, giving according to their
abilities and taking according to their needs (or some other means of
organising production and consumption such as equal income or receiving
labour notes, and so on), or working independently and so free of
communal benefits as well as any commitments (bar those associated with
using communal resources such as roads and so on).

So, in most, if not all, anarchist communities, individuals have two
options, either they can join a commune and work together as equals, or
they can work as an individual or independent co-operative and exchange
the product of their labour with others. If an individual joins a
commune and does not carry their weight, even after their fellow workers
ask them to, then that person will possibly be expelled and given enough
land, tools or means of production to work alone. Of course, if a person
is depressed, run down or otherwise finding it hard to join in communal
responsibilities then their friends and fellow workers would do
everything in their power to help and be flexible in their approach to
the problem. What method a community would use would depend on what
people in that community thought was best.

However, most social anarchists think that the problem of people trying
not to work would be a very minor one in a free society. This is because
productive activity is part of human life and an essential way to
express oneself. With work being voluntary and self-managed, it will
become like current day hobbies and many people work harder at their
hobbies than they do at "real" work (this FAQ can be considered as an
example of this!). How long this takes to organise fully is, of course,
unknown but one of the most important tasks of a free society will be to
ensure work is transformed and the burden of what remains is shared in
order to reduce toil to a minimum.

It is the nature of employment under capitalism, the hierarchical nature
of its workplace, that makes it "work" instead of pleasure. Work need
not be a part of the day that we wish would end. It is **not** work that
people hate. Rather it is **over**-work, in unpleasant circumstances and
under the control of others that people hate. Reduce the hours of
labour, improve the working conditions and place the work under
self-management and work will stop being a hated thing. All these will
help ensure that only an idiot would desire to work alone for, as
Malatesta argued, the *"individual who wished to supply his own material
needs by working alone would be the slave of his labours."* [**The
Anarchist Revolution**, p. 15]

So, enlightened self-interest would secure the voluntary labour and
egalitarian distribution anarchists favour in the vast majority of the
population. The parasitism associated with capitalism would be a thing
of the past. Thus the problem of the "lazy" person fails to understand
the nature of humanity nor the revolutionising effects of freedom on the
nature and content of work.

I.4.15 What will the workplace of tomorrow look like?
-----------------------------------------------------

Given the anarchist desire to liberate the artist in all of us, we can
easily imagine that a free society would totally transform the working
environment. No longer would workers be indifferent to their workplaces,
but they would express themselves in transforming them into pleasant
places, integrated into both the life of the local community and into
the local environment. After all, *"no movement that raises the demand
for workers' councils can be regarded as revolutionary unless it tries
to promote sweeping transformations in the environment of the work
place."* [Murray Bookchin, **Post-Scarcity Anarchism**, p. 88]

A glimpse of the future workplace can been seen from the actual class
struggle. In the 40 day sit-down strike at Fisher Body plant \#1 in
Flint, Michigan in 1936, *"there was a community of two thousand
strikers . . . Committees organised recreation, information, classes, a
postal service, sanitation . . . There were classes in parliamentary
procedure, public speaking, history of the labour movement. Graduate
students at the University of Michigan gave courses in journalism and
creative writing."* [Howard Zinn, **A People's History of the United
States**, p. 391] In the same year, during the Spanish Revolution,
collectivised workplaces also created libraries and education facilities
as well as funding schools, health care and other social necessities (a
practice, we must note, that had started before the revolution when
anarchist unions had funded schools, social centres, libraries and so
on).

The future workplace would be expanded to include education and classes
in individual development. This follows Proudhon's suggestion made
during the 1848 revolution that we should *"[o]rganise association, and
by the same token, every workshop becoming a school, every worker
becomes a master, every student an apprentice."* [**No Gods, No
Masters**, vol. 1, pp. 62-3] This means that in a free society
*"Workers' associations have a very important role to play . . . Linked
to the system of public education, they will become both centres of
production and centres and for education . . . The working masses will
be in daily contact with the youthful army of agricultural and
industrial workers. Labour and study, which have for so long and so
foolishly been kept apart, will finally emerge side by side in their
natural state of union. Instead of being confined to narrow, specialised
fields, vocational education will include a variety of different types
of work which, taken as a whole, will insure that each student becomes
an all-round worker."* [Proudhon, **Selected Writings of Pierre-Joseph
Proudhon**, p. 87]

This would allow work to become part of a wider community, drawing in
people from different areas to share their knowledge and learn new
insights and ideas. In addition, children would have part of their
school studies with workplaces, getting them aware of the practicalities
of many different forms of work and so allowing them to make informed
decisions in what sort of activity they would be interested in pursuing
when they were older.

Obviously, a workplace managed by its workers would also take care to
make the working environment as pleasant as possible. No more "sick
building syndrome" or unhealthy and stressful work areas for *"can we
doubt that work will become a pleasure and a relaxation in a society of
equals, in which 'hands' will not be compelled to sell themselves to
toil, and to accept work under any conditions Repugnant tasks will
disappear, because it is evident that these unhealthy conditions are
harmful to society as a whole. Slaves can submit to them, but free men
[and women] will create new conditions, and their work will be pleasant
and infinitely more productive."* [Kropotkin, **The Conquest of Bread**,
p. 123] Workplaces would be designed to maximise space and allow
individual expression within them. We can imagine such places surrounded
by gardens and allotments which were tended by workers themselves,
giving a pleasant surrounding to the workplace. There would, in effect,
be a break down of the city/rural divide -- workplaces would be placed
next to fields and integrated into the surroundings:

> *"Have the factory and the workshop at the gates of your fields and
> gardens, and work in them. Not those large establishments, of course,
> in which huge masses of metals have to be dealt with and which are
> better placed at certain spots indicated by Nature, but the countless
> variety of workshops and factories which are required to satisfy the
> infinite diversity of tastes among civilised men [and women] . . .
> factories and workshops which men, women and children will not be
> driven by hunger, but will be attracted by the desire of finding an
> activity suited to their tastes, and where, aided by the motor and the
> machine, they will choose the branch of activity which best suits
> their inclinations."* [Kropotkin, **Fields, Factories and Workshops
> Tomorrow**, p. 197]

This vision of rural and urban integration is just part of the future
anarchists see for the workplace. As Kropotkin argued, *"[w]e proclaim
**integration**. . . a society of integrated, combined labour. A society
where each individual is a producer of both manual and intellectual
work; where each able-bodied human being is a worker, and where each
worker works both in the field and the industrial workshop; where every
aggregation of individuals, large enough to dispose of a certain variety
of natural resources -- it may be a nation, or rather a region --
produces and itself consumes most of its own agricultural and
manufactured produce."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 26]

The future workplace would be an expression of the desires of those who
worked there. It would be based around a pleasant working environment,
within gardens and with extensive library, resources for education
classes and other leisure activities. All this, and more, will be
possible in a society based upon self-realisation and self-expression
and one in which individuality is not crushed by authority and
capitalism. To quote Kropotkin, the future workplace would be *"airy and
hygienic, and consequently economical, factories in which human life is
of more account than machinery and the making of extra profits."* [**Op.
Cit.**, p. 197] For, obviously, *"if most of the workshops we know are
foul and unhealthy, it is because the workers are of no account in the
organisation of factories"*. [**The Conquest of Bread**, p. 121]

*"So in brief,"* argued William Morris, *"our buildings will be
beautiful with their own beauty of simplicity as workshops"* and
*"besides the mere workshops, our factory will have other buildings
which may carry ornament further than that, for it will need
dinning-hall, library, school, places for study of different kinds, and
other such structures."* [**A Factory as It Might Be**, p. 9] This is
possible and is only held back by capitalism which denounces such
visions of freedom as "uneconomic." Yet such claims ignore the
distribution of income in class society:

> *"Impossible I hear an anti-Socialist say. My friend, please to
> remember that most factories sustain today large and handsome gardens,
> and not seldom parks . . . **only** the said gardens, etc. are twenty
> miles away from the factory, **out of the smoke,** and are kept up for
> **one member of the factory only,** the sleeping partner to wit."*
> [Morris, **Op. Cit.**, pp. 7-8]

Pleasant working conditions based upon the self-management of work can
produce a workplace within which economic "efficiency" can be achieved
without disrupting and destroying individuality and the environment
(also see [section I.4.9](secI4.html#seci49) for a fuller discussion of
anarchism and technology).

I.4.16 Won't a libertarian communist society be inefficient?
------------------------------------------------------------

It is often argued that anarcho-communism and other forms of non-market
libertarian-socialism would promote inefficiency and unproductive work.
The basis of this argument is that without market forces to discipline
workers and the profit motive to reward them, workers would have no
incentive to work in a way which minimises time or resources. The net
effect of this would be inefficient use of recourses, particularly an
individual's time.

This is a valid point in some ways; for example, a society can
(potentially) benefit from increasing productivity as the less time and
resources it takes to produce a certain good, the more of both it gains
for other activities (although, of course, in a class society the
benefits of increased productivity generally accrue to, first and
foremost, those at the top and, for the rest, the "other activities"
mean more work). Indeed, for an individual, a decent society depends on
people having time available for them to do what they want, to develop
themselves in whatever way they want, to enjoy themselves. In addition,
doing more with less can have a positive environment impact as well. It
is for these reasons that an anarchist society would be interested in
promoting efficiency and productiveness during production.

A free society will undoubtedly create new criteria for what counts as
an efficient use of resources and time. What passes for "efficient" use
capitalism often means what is efficient in increasing the power and
profits of the few, without regard to the wasteful use of individual
time, energy and potential as well as environmental and social costs.
Such a narrow criteria for decision making or evaluating efficient
production will not exist in an anarchist society (see our discussion of
the irrational nature of the price mechanism in [section
I.1.2](secI1.html#seci12), for example). When we use the term efficiency
we mean the dictionary definition of efficiency (i.e. reducing waste,
maximising use of resources) rather than what the capitalist market
distorts this into (i.e. what creates most profits for the boss).

While capitalism has turned improvements in productivity as a means of
increasing work, enriching the few and generally proletarianising the
working class, a free society would take a different approach to the
problem. As argued in [section I.4.3](secI4.html#seci43), a
communist-anarchist society would be based upon the principle of *"**for
some much per day** (in money today, in labour tomorrow) **you are
entitled to satisfy -- luxury excepted -- this or the other of your
wants**."* [Peter Kropotkin, **Small Communal Experiments and why the
fail**, p. 8] Building upon this, we can imagine a situation where the
average output for a given industry in a given amount of time is used to
encourage efficiency and productivity. If a given syndicate can produce
this average output with at least average quality in less time than the
agreed average/minimum (and without causing ecological or social
externalities, of course) then the members of that syndicate can and
should have that time off.

This would be a powerful incentive to innovate, improve productivity,
introduce new machinery and processes as well as work efficiently
without reintroducing the profit motive and material inequality. With
the possibility of having more time available for themselves and their
own projects, people involved in productive activities would have a
strong interest in being efficient. Of course, if the work in question
is something they enjoy then any increases in efficiency would
**enhance** what makes their work enjoyable and not eliminate it.

Rewarding efficiency with free time would also be an important means to
ensure efficient use of resources as well as a means of reducing time
spent in productive activity which was considered as boring or otherwise
undesirable. The incentive of getting unpleasant tasks over with as
quickly as possible would ensure that the tasks were done efficiently
and that innovation was directed towards them. Moreover, when it came to
major investment decisions, a syndicate would be more likely to get
others to agree to its plans if the syndicate had a reputation of
excellence. This, again, would encourage efficiency as people would know
that they could gain resources for their communities and workplaces
(i.e. themselves) more easily if their work is efficient and reliable.
This would be a key means of encouraging efficient and effective use of
resources.

Similarly, an inefficient or wasteful syndicate would have negative
reactions from their fellow workers. As we argued in [section
I.4.7](secI4.html#seci47), a libertarian communist economy would be
based on free association. If a syndicate or community got a reputation
for being inefficient with resources then others would not associate
with them (i.e. they would not supply them with materials, or place them
at the end of the queue when deciding which production requests to
supply, and so on). As with a syndicate which produced shoddy goods, the
inefficient syndicate would also face the judgement of its peers. This
will produce an environment which will encourage efficient use of
resources and time.

All these factors, the possibility of increased free time, the respect
and resources gained for an efficient and excellent work and the
possibility of a lack of co-operation with others for inefficient use of
resources, would ensure that an anarchist-communist or
anarchist-collectivist society would have no need to fear inefficiency.
Indeed, by placing the benefits of increased efficiency into the hands
of those who do the work, efficiency will no doubt increase.

With self-management, we can soon see time and resources being used
efficiently and productively simply because those doing the work would
have a direct and real interest in it. Rather than alienate their
liberty, as under capitalism, they would apply their creativity and
minds to transforming their productive activity in such a way as to make
it enjoyable and not a waste of their time.

Little wonder Kropotkin argued that modern knowledge could be applied to
a society in which people, *"with the work of their own hands and
intelligence, and by the aid of the machinery already invented and to be
invented, should themselves create all imaginable riches. Technics and
science will not be lagging behind if production takes such a direction.
Guided by observation, analysis and experiment, they will answer all
possible demands. They will reduce the time required for producing
wealth to any desired amount, so as to leave to everyone as much leisure
as he or she may ask for . . . they guarantee . . . the happiness that
can be found in the full and varied exercise of the different capacities
of the human being, in work that need not be overwork."* [**Fields,
Factories and Workshops Tomorrow**, pp. 198-9]
