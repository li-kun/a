A.2 What does anarchism stand for?
==================================

These words by Percy Bysshe Shelley gives an idea of what anarchism
stands for in practice and what ideals drive it:

***The man \
 Of virtuous soul commands not, nor obeys:\
 Power, like a desolating pestilence,\
 Pollutes whate'er it touches, and obedience,\
 Bane of all genius, virtue, freedom, truth,\
 Makes slaves of men, and, of the human frame,\
 A mechanised automaton.\
***

As Shelley's lines suggest, anarchists place a high priority on liberty,
desiring it both for themselves and others. They also consider
individuality -- that which makes one a unique person -- to be a most
important aspect of humanity. They recognise, however, that
individuality does not exist in a vacuum but is a **social** phenomenon.
Outside of society, individuality is impossible, since one needs other
people in order to develop, expand, and grow.

Moreover, between individual and social development there is a
reciprocal effect: individuals grow within and are shaped by a
particular society, while at the same time they help shape and change
aspects of that society (as well as themselves and other individuals) by
their actions and thoughts. A society not based on free individuals,
their hopes, dreams and ideas would be hollow and dead. Thus, *"the
making of a human being. . . is a collective process, a process in which
both community and the individual **participate**."* [Murray Bookchin,
**The Modern Crisis**, p. 79] Consequently, any political theory which
bases itself purely on the social or the individual is false.

In order for individuality to develop to the fullest possible extent,
anarchists consider it essential to create a society based on three
principles: **liberty**, **equality** and **solidarity**. These
principles are shared by all anarchists. Thus we find, the
communist-anarchist Peter Kropotkin talking about a revolution inspired
by *"the beautiful words, Liberty, Equality and Solidarity."* [**The
Conquest of Bread**, p. 128] Individualist-anarchist Benjamin Tucker
wrote of a similar vision, arguing that anarchism *"insists on Socialism
. . . on true Socialism, Anarchistic Socialism: the prevalance on earth
of Liberty, Equality, and Solidarity."* [**Instead of a Book**, p. 363]
All three principles are interdependent.

Liberty is essential for the full flowering of human intelligence,
creativity, and dignity. To be dominated by another is to be denied the
chance to think and act for oneself, which is the only way to grow and
develop one's individuality. Domination also stifles innovation and
personal responsibility, leading to conformity and mediocrity. Thus the
society that maximises the growth of individuality will necessarily be
based on voluntary association, not coercion and authority. To quote
Proudhon, *"All associated and all free."* Or, as Luigi Galleani puts
it, anarchism is *"the autonomy of the individual within the freedom of
association"* [**The End of Anarchism?**, p. 35] (See further section
A.2.2 -- [Why do anarchists emphasise liberty?](secA2.html#seca22)).

If liberty is essential for the fullest development of individuality,
then equality is essential for genuine liberty to exist. There can be no
real freedom in a class-stratified, hierarchical society riddled with
gross inequalities of power, wealth, and privilege. For in such a
society only a few -- those at the top of the hierarchy -- are
relatively free, while the rest are semi-slaves. Hence without equality,
liberty becomes a mockery -- at best the "freedom" to choose one's
master (boss), as under capitalism. Moreover, even the elite under such
conditions are not really free, because they must live in a stunted
society made ugly and barren by the tyranny and alienation of the
majority. And since individuality develops to the fullest only with the
widest contact with other free individuals, members of the elite are
restricted in the possibilities for their own development by the
scarcity of free individuals with whom to interact. (See also section
A.2.5 -- [Why are anarchists in favour of equality?](secA2.html#seca25))

Finally, solidarity means mutual aid: working voluntarily and
co-operatively with others who share the same goals and interests. But
without liberty and equality, society becomes a pyramid of competing
classes based on the domination of the lower by the higher strata. In
such a society, as we know from our own, it's "dominate or be
dominated," "dog eat dog," and "everyone for themselves." Thus "rugged
individualism" is promoted at the expense of community feeling, with
those on the bottom resenting those above them and those on the top
fearing those below them. Under such conditions, there can be no
society-wide solidarity, but only a partial form of solidarity within
classes whose interests are opposed, which weakens society as a whole.
(See also section A.2.6 -- [Why is solidarity important to
anarchists?](secA2.html#seca26))

It should be noted that solidarity does not imply self-sacrifice or
self-negation. As Errico Malatesta makes clear:

> *"we are all egoists, we all seek our own satisfaction. But the
> anarchist finds his greatest satisfaction in struggling for the good
> of all, for the achievement of a society in which he [sic] can be a
> brother among brothers, and among healthy, intelligent, educated, and
> happy people. But he who is adaptable, who is satisfied to live among
> slaves and draw profit from the labour of slaves, is not, and cannot
> be, an anarchist."* [**Errico Malatesta: His Life and Ideas**, p. 23]

For anarchists, **real** wealth is other people and the planet on which
we live. Or, in the words of Emma Goldman, it *"consists in things of
utility and beauty, in things which help to create strong, beautiful
bodies and surroundings inspiring to live in . . . [Our] goal is the
freest possible expression of all the latent powers of the individual .
. . Such free display of human energy being possible only under complete
individual and social freedom,"* in other words *"social equality."*
[**Red Emma Speaks**, pp. 67-8]

Also, honouring individuality does not mean that anarchists are
idealists, thinking that people or ideas develop outside of society.
Individuality and ideas grow and develop within society, in response to
material and intellectual interactions and experiences, which people
actively analyse and interpret. Anarchism, therefore, is a
**materialist** theory, recognising that ideas develop and grow from
social interaction and individuals' mental activity (see Michael
Bakunin's **God and the** **State** for the classic discussion of
materialism versus idealism).

This means that an anarchist society will be the creation of human
beings, not some deity or other transcendental principle, since
*"[n]othing ever arranges itself, least of all in human relations. It is
men [sic] who do the arranging, and they do it according to their
attitudes and understanding of things."* [Alexander Berkman, **What is
Anarchism?**, p. 185]

Therefore, anarchism bases itself upon the power of ideas and the
ability of people to act and transform their lives based on what they
consider to be right. In other words, liberty.

A.2.1 What is the essence of anarchism?
---------------------------------------

As we have seen, *"an-archy"* implies *"without rulers"* or *"without
(hierarchical) authority."* Anarchists are not against "authorities" in
the sense of experts who are particularly knowledgeable, skilful, or
wise, though they believe that such authorities should have no power to
force others to follow their recommendations (see [section
B.1](secB1.html#secB1) for more on this distinction). In a nutshell,
then, anarchism is anti-authoritarianism.

Anarchists are anti-authoritarians because they believe that no human
being should dominate another. Anarchists, in L. Susan Brown's words,
*"believe in the inherent dignity and worth of the human individual."*
[**The Politics of Individualism**, p. 107] Domination is inherently
degrading and demeaning, since it submerges the will and judgement of
the dominated to the will and judgement of the dominators, thus
destroying the dignity and self-respect that comes only from personal
autonomy. Moreover, domination makes possible and generally leads to
exploitation, which is the root of inequality, poverty, and social
breakdown.

In other words, then, the essence of anarchism (to express it
positively) is free co-operation between equals to maximise their
liberty and individuality.

Co-operation between equals is the key to anti-authoritarianism. By
co-operation we can develop and protect our own intrinsic value as
unique individuals as well as enriching our lives and liberty for *"[n]o
individual can recognise his own humanity, and consequently realise it
in his lifetime, if not by recognising it in others and co-operating in
its realisation for others . . . My freedom is the freedom of all since
I am not truly free in thought and in fact, except when my freedom and
my rights are confirmed and approved in the freedom and rights of all
men [and women] who are my equals."* [Michael Bakunin, quoted by Errico
Malatesta, **Anarchy**, p. 30]

While being anti-authoritarians, anarchists recognise that human beings
have a social nature and that they mutually influence each other. We
cannot escape the "authority" of this mutual influence, because, as
Bakunin reminds us:

> *"The abolition of this mutual influence would be death. And when we
> advocate the freedom of the masses, we are by no means suggesting the
> abolition of any of the natural influences that individuals or groups
> of individuals exert on them. What we want is the abolition of
> influences which are artificial, privileged, legal, official."*
> [quoted by Malatesta, **Anarchy**, p. 51]

In other words, those influences which stem from hierarchical authority.

This is because hierarchical systems like capitalism deny liberty and,
as a result, people's *"mental, moral, intellectual and physical
qualities are dwarfed, stunted and crushed"* (see [section
B.1](secB1.html) for more details). Thus one of *"the grand truths of
Anarchism"* is that *"to be really free is to allow each one to live
their lives in their own way as long as each allows all to do the
same."* This is why anarchists fight for a better society, for a society
which respects individuals and their freedom. Under capitalism,
*"[e]verything is upon the market for sale: all is merchandise and
commerce"* but there are *"certain things that are priceless. Among
these are life, liberty and happiness, and these are things which the
society of the future, the free society, will guarantee to all."*
Anarchists, as a result, seek to make people aware of their dignity,
individuality and liberty and to encourage the spirit of revolt,
resistance and solidarity in those subject to authority. This gets us
denounced by the powerful as being breakers of the peace, but anarchists
consider the struggle for freedom as infinitely better than the peace of
slavery. Anarchists, as a result of our ideals, *"believe in peace at
any price -- except at the price of liberty. But this precious gift the
wealth-producers already seem to have lost. Life . . . they have; but
what is life worth when it lacks those elements which make for
enjoyment?"* [Lucy Parsons, **Liberty, Equality & Solidarity**, p. 103,
p. 131, p. 103 and p. 134]

So, in a nutshell, Anarchists seek a society in which people interact in
ways which enhance the liberty of all rather than crush the liberty (and
so potential) of the many for the benefit of a few. Anarchists do not
want to give others power over themselves, the power to tell them what
to do under the threat of punishment if they do not obey. Perhaps
non-anarchists, rather than be puzzled why anarchists are anarchists,
would be better off asking what it says about themselves that they feel
this attitude needs any sort of explanation.

A.2.2 Why do anarchists emphasise liberty?
------------------------------------------

An anarchist can be regarded, in Bakunin's words, as a *"fanatic lover
of freedom, considering it as the unique environment within which the
intelligence, dignity and happiness of mankind can develop and
increase."* [**Michael Bakunin: Selected Writings**, p. 196] Because
human beings are thinking creatures, to deny them liberty is to deny
them the opportunity to think for themselves, which is to deny their
very existence as humans. For anarchists, freedom is a product of our
humanity, because:

> *"The very fact. . . that a person has a consciousness of self, of
> being different from others, creates a desire to act freely. The
> craving for liberty and self-expression is a very fundamental and
> dominant trait."* [Emma Goldman, **Red Emma Speaks**, p. 439]

For this reason, anarchism *"proposes to rescue the self-respect and
independence of the individual from all restraint and invasion by
authority. Only in freedom can man [sic!] grow to his full stature. Only
in freedom will he learn to think and move, and give the very best of
himself. Only in freedom will he realise the true force of the social
bonds which tie men together, and which are the true foundations of a
normal social life."* [**Op. Cit.**, pp. 72-3]

Thus, for anarchists, freedom is basically individuals pursuing their
own good in their own way. Doing so calls forth the activity and power
of individuals as they make decisions for and about themselves and their
lives. Only liberty can ensure individual development and diversity.
This is because when individuals govern themselves and make their own
decisions they have to exercise their minds and this can have no other
effect than expanding and stimulating the individuals involved. As
Malatesta put it, *"[f]or people to become educated to freedom and the
management of their own interests, they must be left to act for
themselves, to feel responsibility for their own actions in the good or
bad that comes from them. They'd make mistakes, but they'd understand
from the consequences where they'd gone wrong and try out new ways."*
[**Fra Contadini**, p. 26]

So, liberty is the precondition for the maximum development of one's
individual potential, which is also a social product and can be achieved
only in and through community. A healthy, free community will produce
free individuals, who in turn will shape the community and enrich the
social relationships between the people of whom it is composed.
Liberties, being socially produced, *"do not exist because they have
been legally set down on a piece of paper, but only when they have
become the ingrown habit of a people, and when any attempt to impair
them will meet with the violent resistance of the populace . . . One
compels respect from others when one knows how to defend one's dignity
as a human being. This is not only true in private life; it has always
been the same in political life as well."* In fact, we *"owe all the
political rights and privileges which we enjoy today in greater or
lesser measures, not to the good will of their governments, but to their
own strength."* [Rudolf Rocker, **Anarcho-syndicalism**, p. 75]

It is for this reason anarchists support the tactic of ***"Direct
Action"*** (see [section J.2](secJ2.html)) for, as Emma Goldman argued,
we have *"as much liberty as [we are] willing to take. Anarchism
therefore stands for direct action, the open defiance of, and resistance
to, all laws and restrictions, economic, social, and moral."* It
requires *"integrity, self-reliance, and courage. In short, it calls for
free, independent spirits"* and *"only persistent resistance"* can
*"finally set [us] free. Direct action against the authority in the
shop, direct action against the authority of the law, direct action
against the invasive, meddlesome authority of our moral code, is the
logical, consistent method of Anarchism."* [**Red Emma Speaks**, pp.
76-7]

Direct action is, in other words, the application of liberty, used to
resist oppression in the here and now as well as the means of creating a
free society. It creates the necessary individual mentality and social
conditions in which liberty flourishes. Both are essential as liberty
develops only within society, not in opposition to it. Thus Murray
Bookchin writes:

> *"What freedom, independence, and autonomy people have in a given
> historical period is the product of long social traditions and . . . a
> **collective** development -- which is not to deny that individuals
> play an important role in that development, indeed are ultimately
> obliged to do so if they wish to be free."* [**Social Anarchism or
> Lifestyle Anarchism**, p. 15]

But freedom requires the right **kind** of social environment in which
to grow and develop. Such an environment **must** be decentralised and
based on the direct management of work by those who do it. For
centralisation means coercive authority (hierarchy), whereas
self-management is the essence of freedom. Self-management ensures that
the individuals involved use (and so develop) all their abilities --
particularly their mental ones. Hierarchy, in contrast, substitutes the
activities and thoughts of a few for the activities and thoughts of all
the individuals involved. Thus, rather than developing their abilities
to the full, hierarchy marginalises the many and ensures that their
development is blunted (see also [section B.1](secB1.html)).

It is for this reason that anarchists oppose both capitalism and
statism. As the French anarchist Sebastien Faure noted, authority
*"dresses itself in two principal forms: the political form, that is the
State; and the economic form, that is private property."* [cited by
Peter Marshall, **Demanding the Impossible**, p. 43] Capitalism, like
the state, is based on centralised authority (i.e. of the boss over the
worker), the very purpose of which is to keep the management of work out
of the hands of those who do it. This means *"that the serious, final,
complete liberation of the workers is possible only upon one condition:
that of the appropriation of capital, that is, of raw material and all
the tools of labour, including land, by the whole body of the workers."*
[Michael Bakunin, quoted by Rudolf Rocker, **Op. Cit.**, p. 50]

Hence, as Noam Chomsky argues, a *"consistent anarchist must oppose
private ownership of the means of production and the wage slavery which
is a component of this system, as incompatible with the principle that
labour must be freely undertaken and under the control of the
producer."* [*"Notes on Anarchism"*, **For Reasons of State**, p. 158]

Thus, liberty for anarchists means a non-authoritarian society in which
individuals and groups practice self-management, i.e. they govern
themselves. The implications of this are important. First, it implies
that an anarchist society will be non-coercive, that is, one in which
violence or the threat of violence will not be used to "convince"
individuals to do anything. Second, it implies that anarchists are firm
supporters of individual sovereignty, and that, because of this support,
they also oppose institutions based on coercive authority, i.e.
hierarchy. And finally, it implies that anarchists' opposition to
"government" means only that they oppose centralised, hierarchical,
bureaucratic organisations or government. They do not oppose
self-government through confederations of decentralised, grassroots
organisations, so long as these are based on direct democracy rather
than the delegation of power to "representatives" (see [section
A.2.9](secA2.html#seca29) for more on anarchist organisation). For
authority is the opposite of liberty, and hence any form of organisation
based on the delegation of power is a threat to the liberty and dignity
of the people subjected to that power.

Anarchists consider freedom to be the only social environment within
which human dignity and diversity can flower. Under capitalism and
statism, however, there is no freedom for the majority, as private
property and hierarchy ensure that the inclination and judgement of most
individuals will be subordinated to the will of a master, severely
restricting their liberty and making impossible the *"full development
of all the material, intellectual and moral capacities that are latent
in every one of us."* [Michael Bakunin, **Bakunin on Anarchism**, p.
261] That is why anarchists seek to ensure *"that real justice and real
liberty might come on earth"* for it is *"all false, all unnecessary,
this wild waste of human life, of bone and sinew and brain and heart,
this turning of people into human rags, ghosts, piteous caricatures of
the creatures they had it in them to be, on the day they were born; that
what is called 'economy', the massing up of things, is in reality the
most frightful spending -- the sacrifice of the maker to the made -- the
lose of all the finer and nobler instincts in the gain of one revolting
attribute, the power to count and calculate."* [Voltairine de Cleyre,
**The First Mayday: The Haymarket Speeches 1895-1910**, pp, 17-18]

(See [section B](secBcon.html) for further discussion of the
hierarchical and authoritarian nature of capitalism and statism).

A.2.3 Are anarchists in favour of organisation?
-----------------------------------------------

Yes. Without association, a truly human life is impossible. Liberty
**cannot** exist without society and organisation. As George Barrett
pointed out:

> "To get the full meaning out of life we must co-operate, and to
> co-operate we must make agreements with our fellow-men. But to suppose
> that such agreements mean a limitation of freedom is surely an
> absurdity; on the contrary, they are the exercise of our freedom.
>
> "If we are going to invent a dogma that to make agreements is to
> damage freedom, then at once freedom becomes tyrannical, for it
> forbids men to take the most ordinary everyday pleasures. For example,
> I cannot go for a walk with my friend because it is against the
> principle of Liberty that I should agree to be at a certain place at a
> certain time to meet him. I cannot in the least extend my own power
> beyond myself, because to do so I must co-operate with someone else,
> and co-operation implies an agreement, and that is against Liberty. It
> will be seen at once that this argument is absurd. I do not limit my
> liberty, but simply exercise it, when I agree with my friend to go for
> a walk.
>
> "If, on the other hand, I decide from my superior knowledge that it is
> good for my friend to take exercise, and therefore I attempt to compel
> him to go for a walk, then I begin to limit freedom. This is the
> difference between free agreement and government." [**Objections to
> Anarchism**, pp. 348-9]

As far as organisation goes, anarchists think that *"far from creating
authority, [it] is the only cure for it and the only means whereby each
of us will get used to taking an active and conscious part in collective
work, and cease being passive instruments in the hands of leaders."*
[Errico Malatesta, **Errico Malatesta: His Life and Ideas**, p. 86] Thus
anarchists are well aware of the need to organise in a structured and
open manner. As Carole Ehrlich points out, while anarchists *"aren't
opposed to structure"* and simply *"want to abolish **hierarchical**
structure"* they are *"almost always stereotyped as wanting no structure
at all."* This is not the case, for *"organisations that would build in
accountability, diffusion of power among the maximum number of persons,
task rotation, skill-sharing, and the spread of information and
resources"* are based on *"good social anarchist principles of
organisation!"* [*"Socialism, Anarchism and Feminism"*, **Quiet Rumours:
An Anarcha-Feminist Reader**, p. 47 and p. 46]

The fact that anarchists are in favour of organisation may seem strange
at first, but it is understandable. *"For those with experience only of
authoritarian organisation,"* argue two British anarchists, *"it appears
that organisation can only be totalitarian or democratic, and that those
who disbelieve in government must by that token disbelieve in
organisation at all. That is not so."* [Stuart Christie and Albert
Meltzer, **The Floodgates of Anarchy**, p. 122] In other words, because
we live in a society in which virtually all forms of organisation are
authoritarian, this makes them appear to be the only kind possible. What
is usually not recognised is that this mode of organisation is
historically conditioned, arising within a specific kind of society --
one whose motive principles are domination and exploitation. According
to archaeologists and anthropologists, this kind of society has only
existed for about 5,000 years, having appeared with the first primitive
states based on conquest and slavery, in which the labour of slaves
created a surplus which supported a ruling class.

Prior to that time, for hundreds of thousands of years, human and
proto-human societies were what Murray Bookchin calls *"organic,"* that
is, based on co-operative forms of economic activity involving mutual
aid, free access to productive resources, and a sharing of the products
of communal labour according to need. Although such societies probably
had status rankings based on age, there were no hierarchies in the sense
of institutionalised dominance-subordination relations enforced by
coercive sanctions and resulting in class-stratification involving the
economic exploitation of one class by another (see Murray Bookchin,
**The Ecology of Freedom**).

It must be emphasised, however, that anarchists do **not** advocate
going "back to the Stone Age." We merely note that since the
hierarchical-authoritarian mode of organisation is a relatively recent
development in the course of human social evolution, there is no reason
to suppose that it is somehow "fated" to be permanent. We do not think
that human beings are genetically "programmed" for authoritarian,
competitive, and aggressive behaviour, as there is no credible evidence
to support this claim. On the contrary, such behaviour is socially
conditioned, or **learned**, and as such, can be **unlearned** (see
Ashley Montagu, **The Nature of Human Aggression**). We are not
fatalists or genetic determinists, but believe in free will, which means
that people can change the way they do things, including the way they
organise society.

And there is no doubt that society needs to be better organised, because
presently most of its wealth -- which is produced by the majority -- and
power gets distributed to a small, elite minority at the top of the
social pyramid, causing deprivation and suffering for the rest,
particularly for those at the bottom. Yet because this elite controls
the means of coercion through its control of the state (see [section
B.2.3](secB2.html#secb23)), it is able to suppress the majority and
ignore its suffering -- a phenomenon that occurs on a smaller scale
within all hierarchies. Little wonder, then, that people within
authoritarian and centralised structures come to hate them as a denial
of their freedom. As Alexander Berkman puts it:

> *"Any one who tells you that Anarchists don't believe in organisation
> is talking nonsense. Organisation is everything, and everything is
> organisation. The whole of life is organisation, conscious or
> unconscious . . . But there is organisation and organisation.
> Capitalist society is so badly organised that its various members
> suffer: just as when you have a pain in some part of you, your whole
> body aches and you are ill. . . , not a single member of the
> organisation or union may with impunity be discriminated against,
> suppressed or ignored. To do so would be the same as to ignore an
> aching tooth: you would be sick all over."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 198]

Yet this is precisely what happens in capitalist society, with the
result that it is, indeed, *"sick all over."*

For these reasons, anarchists reject authoritarian forms of organisation
and instead support associations based on free agreement. Free agreement
is important because, in Berkman's words, *"[o]nly when each is a free
and independent unit, co-operating with others from his own choice
because of mutual interests, can the world work successfully and become
powerful."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 199] As we discuss in [section
A.2.14](secA2.html#seca214), anarchists stress that free agreement has
to be complemented by direct democracy (or, as it is usually called by
anarchists, self-management) within the association itself otherwise
"freedom" become little more than picking masters.

Anarchist organisation is based on a massive decentralisation of power
back into the hands of the people, i.e. those who are directly affected
by the decisions being made. To quote Proudhon:

> *"Unless democracy is a fraud and the sovereignty of the People a
> joke, it must be admitted that each citizen in the sphere of his [or
> her] industry, each municipal, district or provincial council within
> its own territory . . . should act directly and by itself in
> administering the interests which it includes, and should exercise
> full sovereignty in relation to them."* [**The General Idea of the
> Revolution**, p. 276]

It also implies a need for federalism to co-ordinate joint interests.
For anarchism, federalism is the natural complement to self-management.
With the abolition of the State, society *"can, and must, organise
itself in a different fashion, but not from top to bottom . . . The
future social organisation must be made solely from the bottom upwards,
by the free association or federation of workers, firstly in their
unions, then in the communes, regions, nations and finally in a great
federation, international and universal. Then alone will be realised the
true and life-giving order of freedom and the common good, that order
which, far from denying, on the contrary affirms and brings into harmony
the interests of individuals and of society."* [Bakunin, **Michael
Bakunin: Selected Writings**, pp. 205-6] Because a *"truly popular
organisation begins . . . from below"* and so *"federalism becomes a
political institution of Socialism, the free and spontaneous
organisation of popular life."* Thus libertarian socialism *"is
federalistic in character."* [Bakunin, **The Political Philosophy of
Bakunin**, pp. 273-4 and p. 272]

Therefore, anarchist organisation is based on direct democracy (or
self-management) and federalism (or confederation). These are the
expression and environment of liberty. Direct (or participatory)
democracy is essential because liberty and equality imply the need for
forums within which people can discuss and debate as equals and which
allow for the free exercise of what Murray Bookchin calls *"the creative
role of dissent."* Federalism is necessary to ensure that common
interests are discussed and joint activity organised in a way which
reflects the wishes of all those affected by them. To ensure that
decisions flow from the bottom up rather than being imposed from the top
down by a few rulers.

Anarchist ideas on libertarian organisation and the need for direct
democracy and confederation will be discussed further in sections
[A.2.9](secA2.html#seca29) and [A.2.11](secA2.html#seca211).

A.2.4 Are anarchists in favour of "absolute" liberty?
-----------------------------------------------------

No. Anarchists do not believe that everyone should be able to *"do*
*whatever they like,"* because some actions invariably involve the
denial of the liberty of others.

For example, anarchists do not support the "freedom" to rape, to
exploit, or to coerce others. Neither do we tolerate authority. On the
contrary, since authority is a threat to liberty, equality, and
solidarity (not to mention human dignity), anarchists recognise the need
to resist and overthrow it.

The exercise of authority is not freedom. No one has a "right" to rule
others. As Malatesta points out, anarchism supports *"freedom for
everybody . . . with the only limit of the equal freedom for others;
which does **not** mean . . . that we recognise, and wish to respect,
the 'freedom' to exploit, to oppress, to command, which is oppression
and certainly not freedom."*[**Errico Malatesta: His Life and Ideas**,
p. 53]

In a capitalist society, resistance to all forms of hierarchical
authority is the mark of a free person -- be it private (the boss) or
public (the state). As Henry David Thoreau pointed out in his essay on
**"Civil** **Disobedience"** (1847)

> *"Disobedience is the true foundation of liberty. The obedient must be
> slaves."*

A.2.5 Why are anarchists in favour of equality?
-----------------------------------------------

As mentioned in [above](secA2.html), anarchists are dedicated to social
equality because it is the only context in which individual liberty can
flourish. However, there has been much nonsense written about
"equality," and much of what is commonly believed about it is very
strange indeed. Before discussing what anarchist **do** mean by
equality, we have to indicate what we **do not** mean by it.

Anarchists do **not** believe in *"equality of endowment,"* which is not
only non-existent but would be **very** undesirable if it could be
brought about. Everyone is unique. Biologically determined human
differences not only exist but are *"a cause for joy, not fear or
regret."* Why? Because *"life among clones would not be worth living,
and a sane person will only rejoice that others have abilities that they
do not share."* [Noam Chomsky, **Marxism, Anarchism, and Alternative
Futures**, p. 782]

That some people **seriously** suggest that anarchists means by
"equality" that everyone should be **identical** is a sad reflection on
the state of present-day intellectual culture and the corruption of
words -- a corruption used to divert attention from an unjust and
authoritarian system and side-track people into discussions of biology.
*"The uniqueness of the self in no way contradicts the principle of
equality,"* noted Erich Fromm, *"The thesis that men are born equal
implies that they all share the same fundamental human qualities, that
they share the same basic fate of human beings, that they all have the
same inalienable claim on freedom and happiness. It furthermore means
that their relationship is one of solidarity, not one of
domination-submission. What the concept of equality does not mean is
that all men are alike."* [**The Fear of Freedom**, p. 228] Thus it
would be fairer to say that anarchists seek equality **because** we
recognise that everyone is different and, consequently, seek the full
affirmation and development of that uniqueness.

Nor are anarchists in favour of so-called *"equality of outcome."* We
have **no** desire to live in a society were everyone gets the same
goods, lives in the same kind of house, wears the same uniform, etc.
Part of the reason for the anarchist revolt against capitalism and
statism is that they standardise so much of life (see George Reitzer's
**The McDonaldisation of Society** on why capitalism is driven towards
standardisation and conformity). In the words of Alexander Berkman:

> *"The spirit of authority, law, written and unwritten, tradition and
> custom force us into a common grove and make a man [or woman] a
> will-less automation without independence or individuality. . . All of
> us are its victims, and only the exceptionally strong succeed in
> breaking its chains, and that only partly."* [**What is Anarchism?**,
> p. 165]

Anarchists, therefore, have little to desire to make this *"common
grove"* even deeper. Rather, we desire to destroy it and every social
relationship and institution that creates it in the first place.

*"Equality of outcome"* can only be introduced and maintained by force,
which would **not** be equality anyway, as some would have more power
than others! *"Equality of outcome"* is particularly hated by
anarchists, as we recognise that every individual has different needs,
abilities, desires and interests. To make all consume the same would be
tyranny. Obviously, if one person needs medical treatment and another
does not, they do not receive an "equal" amount of medical care. The
same is true of other human needs. As Alexander Berkman put it:

> "equality does not mean an equal amount but equal **opportunity**. . .
> Do not make the mistake of identifying equality in liberty with the
> forced equality of the convict camp. True anarchist equality implies
> freedom, not quantity. It does not mean that every one must eat,

> manner. Far from it: the very reverse in fact."
>
> "Individual needs and tastes differ, as appetites differ. It is
> **equal opportunity to satisfy** them that constitutes true equality.
>
> "Far from levelling, such equality opens the door for the greatest
> possible variety of activity and development. For human character is
> diverse . . . Free opportunity of expressing and acting out your
> individuality means development of natural dissimilarities and
> variations." [**Op. Cit.**, pp. 164-5]

For anarchists, the "concepts" of "equality" as "equality of outcome" or
"equality of endowment" are meaningless. However, in a hierarchical
society, "equality of opportunity" and "equality of outcome" **are**
related. Under capitalism, for example, the opportunities each
generation face are dependent on the outcomes of the previous ones. This
means that under capitalism "equality of opportunity" without a rough
"equality of outcome" (in the sense of income and resources) becomes
meaningless, as there is no real equality of opportunity for the
off-spring of a millionaire and that of a road sweeper. Those who argue
for "equality of opportunity" while ignoring the barriers created by
previous outcomes indicate that they do not know what they are talking
about -- opportunity in a hierarchical society depends not only on an
open road but also upon an equal start. From this obvious fact springs
the misconception that anarchists desire "equality of outcome" -- but
this applies to a hierarchical system, in a free society this would not
the case (as we will see).

Equality, in anarchist theory, does not mean denying individual
diversity or uniqueness. As Bakunin observes:

> *"once equality has triumphed and is well established, will various
> individuals' abilities and their levels of energy cease to differ?
> Some will exist, perhaps not so many as now, but certainly some will
> always exist. It is proverbial that the same tree never bears two
> identical leaves, and this will probably be always be true. And it is
> even more truer with regard to human beings, who are much more complex
> than leaves. But this diversity is hardly an evil. On the contrary. .
> . it is a resource of the human race. Thanks to this diversity,
> humanity is a collective whole in which the one individual complements
> all the others and needs them. As a result, this infinite diversity of
> human individuals is the fundamental cause and the very basis of their
> solidarity. It is all-powerful argument for equality."* [*"All-Round
> Education"*, **The Basic Bakunin**, pp. 117-8]

Equality for anarchists means **social** equality, or, to use Murray
Bookchin's term, the ***"equality of unequals"*** (some like Malatesta
used the term ***"equality of conditions"*** to express the same idea).
By this he means that an anarchist society recognises the differences in
ability and need of individuals but does not allow these differences to
be turned into power. Individual differences, in other words, *"would be
of no consequence, because inequality in fact is lost in the
collectivity when it cannot cling to some legal fiction or
institution."* [Michael Bakunin, **God and the State**, p. 53]

If hierarchical social relationships, and the forces that create them,
are abolished in favour of ones that encourage participation and are
based on the principle of "one person, one vote" then natural
differences would not be able to be turned into hierarchical power. For
example, without capitalist property rights there would not be means by
which a minority could monopolise the means of life (machinery and land)
and enrich themselves by the work of others via the wages system and
usury (profits, rent and interest). Similarly, if workers manage their
own work, there is no class of capitalists to grow rich off their
labour. Thus Proudhon:

> "Now, what can be the origin of this inequality?
>
> "As we see it, . . . that origin is the realisation within society of
> this triple abstraction: capital, labour and talent.
>
> "It is because society has divided itself into three categories of
> citizen corresponding to the three terms of the formula. . . that
> caste distinctions have always been arrived at, and one half of the
> human race enslaved to the other. . . socialism thus consists of
> reducing the aristocratic formula of capital-labour-talent into the
> simpler formula of labour!. . . in order to make every citizen
> simultaneously, equally and to the same extent capitalist, labourer
> and expert or artist." [**No Gods, No Masters**, vol. 1, pp. 57-8]

Like all anarchists, Proudhon saw this integration of functions as the
key to equality and freedom and proposed self-management as the means to
achieve it. Thus self-management is the key to social equality. Social
equality in the workplace, for example, means that everyone has an equal
say in the policy decisions on how the workplace develops and changes.
Anarchists are strong believers in the maxim "that which touches all, is
decided by all."

This does not mean, of course, that expertise will be ignored or that
everyone will decide everything. As far as expertise goes, different
people have different interests, talents, and abilities, so obviously
they will want to study different things and do different kinds of work.
It is also obvious that when people are ill they consult a doctor -- an
expert -- who manages his or her own work rather than being directed by
a committee. We are sorry to have to bring these points up, but once the
topics of social equality and workers' self-management come up, some
people start to talk nonsense. It is common sense that a hospital
managed in a socially equal way will **not** involve non-medical staff
voting on how doctors should perform an operation!

In fact, social equality and individual liberty are inseparable. Without
the collective self-management of decisions that affect a group
(equality) to complement the individual self-management of decisions
that affect the individual (liberty), a free society is impossible. For
without both, some will have power over others, making decisions **for**
them (i.e. governing them), and thus some will be more free than others.
Which implies, just to state the obvious, anarchists seek equality in
**all** aspects of life, not just in terms of wealth. Anarchists
*"demand for every person not just his [or her] entire measure of the
wealth of society but also his [or her] portion of social power."*
[Malatesta and Hamon, **No Gods, No Masters**, vol. 2, p. 20] Thus
self-management is needed to ensure both liberty **and** equality.

Social equality is required for individuals to both govern and express
themselves, for the self-management it implies means *"people working in
face-to-face relations with their fellows in order to bring the
uniqueness of their own perspective to the business of solving common
problems and achieving common goals."* [George Benello, **From the
Ground Up**, p. 160] Thus equality allows the expression of
individuality and so is a necessary base for individual liberty.

Section F.3 (["Why do 'anarcho'-capitalists place little or no value on
equality?"](secF3.html)) discusses anarchist ideas on equality further.
Noam Chomsky's essay *"Equality"* (contained in **The Chomsky Reader**)
is a good summary of libertarian ideas on the subject.

A.2.6 Why is solidarity important to anarchists?
------------------------------------------------

Solidarity, or mutual aid, is a key idea of anarchism. It is the link
between the individual and society, the means by which individuals can
work together to meet their common interests in an environment that
supports and nurtures both liberty and equality. For anarchists, mutual
aid is a fundamental feature of human life, a source of both strength
and happiness and a fundamental requirement for a fully human existence.

Erich Fromm, noted psychologist and socialist humanist, points out that
the *"human desire to experience union with others is rooted in the
specific conditions of existence that characterise the human species and
is one of the strongest motivations of human behaviour."* [**To Be or To
Have**, p.107]

Therefore anarchists consider the desire to form "unions" (to use Max
Stirner's term) with other people to be a natural need. These unions, or
associations, must be based on equality and individuality in order to be
fully satisfying to those who join them -- i.e. they must be organised
in an anarchist manner, i.e. voluntary, decentralised, and
non-hierarchical.

Solidarity -- co-operation between individuals -- is necessary for life
and is far from a denial of liberty. Solidarity, observed Errico
Malatesta, *"is the only environment in which Man can express his
personality and achieve his optimum development and enjoy the greatest
possible wellbeing."* This *"coming together of individuals for the
wellbeing of all, and of all for the wellbeing of each,"* results in
*"the freedom of each not being limited by, but complemented -- indeed
finding the necessary **raison d'etre** in -- the freedom of others."*
[**Anarchy**, p. 29] In other words, solidarity and co-operation means
treating each other as equals, refusing to treat others as means to an
end and creating relationships which support freedom for all rather than
a few dominating the many. Emma Goldman reiterated this theme, noting
*"what wonderful results this unique force of man's individuality has
achieved when strengthened by co-operation with other individualities .
. . co-operation -- as opposed to internecine strife and struggle -- has
worked for the survival and evolution of the species. . . . only mutual
aid and voluntary co-operation . . . can create the basis for a free
individual and associational life."* [**Red Emma Speaks**, p. 118]

Solidarity means associating together as equals in order to satisfy our
common interests and needs. Forms of association not based on solidarity
(i.e. those based on inequality) will crush the individuality of those
subjected to them. As Ret Marut points out, liberty needs solidarity,
the recognition of common interests:

> *"The most noble, pure and true love of mankind is the love of
> oneself. **I** want to be free! **I** hope to be happy! **I** want to
> appreciate all the beauties of the world. But my freedom is secured
> **only** when all other people around me are free. I can only be happy
> when all other people around me are happy. I can only be joyful when
> all the people I see and meet look at the world with joy-filled eyes.
> And **only** then can I eat my fill with pure enjoyment when I have
> the secure knowledge that other people, too, can eat their fill as I
> do. And for that reason it is a question of **my own contentment**,
> only of **my own self**, when I rebel against every danger which
> threatens my freedom and my happiness. . ."* [Ret Marut (a.k.a. B.
> Traven), **The BrickBurner** magazine quoted by Karl S. Guthke, **B.
> Traven: The life behind the legends**, pp. 133-4]

To practice solidarity means that we recognise, as in the slogan of
**Industrial Workers of the World**, that *"an injury to one is an
injury to all."* Solidarity, therefore, is the means to protect
individuality and liberty and so is an expression of self-interest. As
Alfie Kohn points out:

> *"when we think about co-operation. . . we tend to associate the
> concept with fuzzy-minded idealism. . . This may result from confusing
> co-operation with altruism. . . Structural co-operation defies the
> usual egoism/altruism dichotomy. It sets things up so that by helping
> you I am helping myself at the same time. Even if my motive initially
> may have been selfish, our fates now are linked. We sink or swim
> together. Co-operation is a shrewd and highly successful strategy - a
> pragmatic choice that gets things done at work and at school even more
> effectively than competition does. . . There is also good evidence
> that co-operation is more conductive to psychological health and to
> liking one another."* [**No Contest: The Case Against Competition**,
> p. 7]

And, within a hierarchical society, solidarity is important not only
because of the satisfaction it gives us, but also because it is
necessary to resist those in power. Malatesta's words are relevant here:

> *"the oppressed masses who have never completely resigned themselves
> to oppress and poverty, and who . . . show themselves thirsting for
> justice, freedom and wellbeing, are beginning to understand that they
> will not be able to achieve their emancipation except by union and
> solidarity with all the oppressed, with the exploited everywhere in
> the world."* [**Anarchy**, p. 33]

By standing together, we can increase our strength and get what we want.
Eventually, by organising into groups, we can start to manage our own
collective affairs together and so replace the boss once and for all.
*"**Unions** will. . . multiply the individual's means and secure his
assailed property."* [Max Stirner, **The Ego and Its Own**, p. 258] By
acting in solidarity, we can also replace the current system with one
more to our liking: *"in union there is strength."* [Alexander Berkman,
**What is Anarchism?**, p. 74]

Solidarity is thus the means by which we can obtain and ensure our own
freedom. We agree to work together so that we will not have to work for
**another**. By agreeing to share with each other we increase our
options so that we may enjoy **more**, not less. Mutual aid is in my
self-interest -- that is, I see that it is to my advantage to reach
agreements with others based on mutual respect and social equality; for
if I dominate someone, this means that the conditions exist which allow
domination, and so in all probability I too will be dominated in turn.

As Max Stirner saw, solidarity is the means by which we ensure that our
liberty is strengthened and defended from those in power who want to
rule us: *"Do you yourself count for nothing then?"*, he asks. *"Are you
bound to let anyone do anything he wants to you? Defend yourself and no
one will touch you. If millions of people are behind you, supporting
you, then you are a formidable force and you will win without
difficulty."* [quoted in Luigi Galleani's **The End of Anarchism?**, p.
79 - different translation in **The Ego and Its Own**, p. 197]

Solidarity, therefore, is important to anarchists because it is the
means by which liberty can be created and defended against power.
Solidarity is strength and a product of our nature as social beings.
However, solidarity should not be confused with "herdism," which implies
passively following a leader. In order to be effective, solidarity must
be created by free people, co-operating together as **equals**. The "big
WE" is **not** solidarity, although the desire for "herdism" is a
product of our need for solidarity and union. It is a "solidarity"
corrupted by hierarchical society, in which people are conditioned to
blindly obey leaders.

A.2.7 Why do anarchists argue for self-liberation?
--------------------------------------------------

Liberty, by its very nature, cannot be given. An individual cannot be
freed by another, but must break his or her own chains through their own
effort. Of course, self-effort can also be part of collective action,
and in many cases it has to be in order to attain its ends. As Emma
Goldman points out:

> *"History tells us that every oppressed class [or group or individual]
> gained true liberation from its masters by its own efforts."* [**Red
> Emma Speaks**, p. 167]

This is because anarchists recognise that hierarchical systems, like any
social relationship, shapes those subject to them. As Bookchin argued,
"*class societies organise our psychic structures for command or
obedience."* This means that people ***internalise*** the values of
hierarchical and class society and, as such, *"the State is not merely a
constellation of bureaucratic and coercive instituions. It is also a
state of mind, an instilled mentality for ordering reality . . . Its
capacity to rule by brute force has always been limited . . . Without a
high degree of co-operation from even the most victimised classes of
society such as chattel slaves and serfs, its authority would eventually
dissipate. Awe and apathy in the face of State power are products of
social conditioning that renders this very power possible."* [**The
Ecology of Freedom**, p. 159 and pp. 164-5] Self-liberation is the means
by which we break down both internal ***and*** external chains, freeing
ourselves mentally as well as physically.

Anarchists have long argued that people can only free themselves by
their own actions. The various methods anarchists suggest to aid this
process will be discussed in section J (["What Do Anarchists
Do?"](secJcon.html)) and will not be discussed here. However, these
methods all involve people organising themselves, setting their own
agendas, and acting in ways that empower them and eliminate their
dependence on leaders to do things for them. Anarchism is based on
people *"acting for themselves"* (performing what anarchists call
***"direct action"*** -- see [section J.2](secJ2.html) for details).

Direct action has an empowering and liberating effect on those involved
in it. Self-activity is the means by which the creativity, initiative,
imagination and critical thought of those subjected to authority can be
developed. It is the means by which society can be changed. As Errico
Malatesta pointed out:

> "Between man and his social environment there is a reciprocal action.
> Men make society what it is and society makes men what they are, and
> the result is therefore a kind of vicious circle. To transform society
> men [and women] must be changed, and to transform men, society must be
> changed . . . Fortunately existing society has not been created by the
> inspired will of a dominating class, which has succeeded in reducing
> all its subjects to passive and unconscious instruments of its
> interests. It is the result of a thousand internecine struggles, of a
> thousand human and natural factors . . .
> "From this the possibility of progress . . . We must take advantage of
> all the means, all the possibilities and the opportunities that the
> present environment allows us to act on our fellow men [and women] and
> to develop their consciences and their demands . . . to claim and to
> impose those major social transformations which are possible and which
> effectively serve to open the way to further advances later . . . We
> must seek to get all the people . . . to make demands, and impose
> itself and take for itself all the improvements and freedoms it
> desires as and when it reaches the state of wanting them, and the
> power to demand them . . . we must push the people to want always more
> and to increase its pressures [on the ruling elite], until it has
> achieved complete emancipation." [**Errico Malatesta: His Life and
> Ideas**, pp. 188-9]

Society, while shaping all individuals, is also created by them, through
their actions, thoughts, and ideals. Challenging institutions that limit
one's freedom is mentally liberating, as it sets in motion the process
of questioning authoritarian relationships in general. This process
gives us insight into how society works, changing our ideas and creating
new ideals. To quote Emma Goldman again: *"True emancipation begins. . .
in woman's soul."* And in a man's too, we might add. It is only here
that we can *"begin [our] inner regeneration, [cutting] loose from the
weight of prejudices, traditions and customs."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 167]
But this process must be self-directed, for as Max Stirner notes, *"the
man who is set free is nothing but a freed man. . . a dog dragging a
piece of chain with him."* [**The Ego and Its Own**, p. 168] By changing
the world, even in a small way, we change ourselves.

In an interview during the Spanish Revolution, the Spanish anarchist
militant Durutti said, *"we have a new world in our hearts."* Only
self-activity and self-liberation allows us to create such a vision and
gives us the confidence to try to actualise it in the real world.

Anarchists, however, do not think that self-liberation must wait for the
future, after the "glorious revolution." The personal is political, and
given the nature of society, how we act in the here and now will
influence the future of our society and our lives. Therefore, even in
pre-anarchist society anarchists try to create, as Bakunin puts it,
*"not only the ideas but also the facts of the future itself."* We can
do so by creating alternative social relationships and organisations,
acting as free people in a non-free society. Only by our actions in the
here and now can we lay the foundation for a free society. Moreover,
this process of self-liberation goes on all the time:

> *"Subordinates of all kinds exercise their capacity for critical
> self-reflection every day -- that is why masters are thwarted,
> frustrated and, sometimes, overthrown. But unless masters are
> overthrown, unless subordinates engage in political activity, no
> amount of critical reflection will end their subjection and bring them
> freedom."* [Carole Pateman, **The Sexual Contract**, p. 205]

Anarchists aim to encourage these tendencies in everyday life to reject,
resist and thwart authority and bring them to their logical conclusion
-- a society of free individuals, co-operating as equals in free,
self-managed associations. Without this process of critical
self-reflection, resistance and self-liberation a free society is
impossible. Thus, for anarchists, anarchism comes from the natural
resistance of subordinated people striving to act as free individuals
within a hierarchical world. This process of resistance is called by
many anarchists the ***"class struggle"*** (as it is working class
people who are generally the most subordinated group within society) or,
more generally, ***"social struggle."*** It is this everyday resistance
to authority (in all its forms) and the desire for freedom which is the
key to the anarchist revolution. It is for this reason that *"anarchists
emphasise over and over that the class struggle provides the only means
for the workers [and other oppressed groups] to achieve control over
their destiny."* [Marie-Louise Berneri, **Neither East Nor West**, p.
32]

Revolution is a process, not an event, and every *"spontaneous
revolutionary action"* usually results from and is based upon the
patient work of many years of organisation and education by people with
"utopian" ideas. The process of "creating the new world in the shell of
the old" (to use another **I.W.W.** expression), by building alternative
institutions and relationships, is but one component of what must be a
long tradition of revolutionary commitment and militancy.

As Malatesta made clear, *"to encourage popular organisations of all
kinds is the logical consequence of our basic ideas, and should
therefore be an integral part of our programme. . . anarchists do not
want to emancipate the people; we want the people to emancipate
themselves. . . , we want the new way of life to emerge from the body of
the people and correspond to the state of their development and advance
as they advance."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 90]

Unless a process of self-emancipation occurs, a free society is
impossible. Only when individuals free themselves, both materially (by
abolishing the state and capitalism) and intellectually (by freeing
themselves of submissive attitudes towards authority), can a free
society be possible. We should not forget that capitalist and state
power, to a great extent, is power over the minds of those subject to
them (backed up, of course, with sizeable force if the mental domination
fails and people start rebelling and resisting). In effect, a spiritual
power as the ideas of the ruling class dominate society and permeate the
minds of the oppressed. As long as this holds, the working class will
acquiesce to authority, oppression and exploitation as the normal
condition of life. Minds submissive to the doctrines and positions of
their masters cannot hope to win freedom, to revolt and fight. Thus the
oppressed must overcome the mental domination of the existing system
before they can throw off its yoke (and, anarchists argue, direct action
is the means of doing both -- see sections [J.2](secJ2.html) and
[J.4](secJ4.html)). Capitalism and statism must be beaten spiritually
and theoretically before it is beaten materially (many anarchists call
this mental liberation ***"class consciousness"*** -- see [section
B.7.4](secB7.html#secb74)). And self-liberation through struggle against
oppression is the only way this can be done. Thus anarchists encourage
(to use Kropotkin's term) ***"the spirit of revolt."***

Self-liberation is a product of struggle, of self-organisation,
solidarity and direct action. Direct action is the means of creating
anarchists, free people, and so *"Anarchists have always advised taking
an active part in those workers' organisations which carry on the
**direct** struggle of Labour against Capital and its protector, -- the
State."* This is because *"[s]uch a struggle . . . better than any
indirect means, permits the worker to obtain some temporary improvements
in the present conditions of work, while it opens his [or her] eyes to
the evil that is done by Capitalism and the State that supports it, and
wakes up his [or her] thoughts concerning the possibility of organising
consumption, production and exchange without the intervention of the
capitalist and the state,"* that is, see the possibility of a free
society. Kropotkin, like many anarchists, pointed to the Syndicalist and
Trade Union movements as a means of developing libertarian ideas within
existing society (although he, like most anarchists, did not limit
anarchist activity exclusively to them). Indeed, any movement which
*"permit[s] the working men [and women] to realise their solidarity and
to feel the community of their interests . . . prepare[s] the way for
these conceptions"* of communist-anarchism, i.e. the overcoming the
spiritual domination of existing society within the minds of the
oppressed. [**Evolution and Environment**, p. 83 and p. 85]

For anarchists, in the words of a Scottish Anarchist militant, the
*"history of human progress [is] seen as the history of rebellion and
disobedience, with the individual debased by subservience to authority
in its many forms and able to retain his/her dignity only through
rebellion and disobedience."* [Robert Lynn, **Not a Life Story, Just a
Leaf from It**, p. 77] This is why anarchists stress self-liberation
(and self-organisation, self-management and self-activity). Little
wonder Bakunin considered *"rebellion"* as one of the *"three
fundamental principles [which] constitute the essential conditions of
all human development, collective or individual, in history."* [**God
and the State**, p. 12] This is simply because individuals and groups
cannot be freed by others, only by themselves. Such rebellion
(self-liberation) is the **only** means by which existing society
becomes more libertarian and an anarchist society a possibility.

A.2.8 Is it possible to be an anarchist without opposing hierarchy?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

No. We have seen that anarchists abhor authoritarianism. But if one is
an anti-authoritarian, one must oppose all hierarchical institutions,
since they embody the principle of authority. For, as Emma Goldman
argued, *"it is not only government in the sense of the state which is
destructive of every individual value and quality. It is the whole
complex authority and institutional domination which strangles life. It
is the superstition, myth, pretence, evasions, and subservience which
support authority and institutional domination."* [**Red Emma Speaks**,
p. 435] This means that *"there is and will always be a need to discover
and overcome structures of hierarchy, authority and domination and
constraints on freedom: slavery, wage-slavery [i.e. capitalism], racism,
sexism, authoritarian schools, etc."* [Noam Chomsky, **Language and
Politics**, p. 364]

Thus the consistent anarchist must oppose hierarchical relationships as
well as the state. Whether economic, social or political, to be an
anarchist means to oppose hierarchy. The argument for this (if anybody
needs one) is as follows:

> *"All authoritarian institutions are organised as pyramids: the state,
> the private or public corporation, the army, the police, the church,
> the university, the hospital: they are all pyramidal structures with a
> small group of decision-makers at the top and a broad base of people
> whose decisions are **made for them** at the bottom. Anarchism does
> not demand the changing of labels on the layers, it doesn't want
> different people on top, it wants **us** to clamber out from
> underneath."* [Colin Ward, **Anarchy in Action**, p. 22]

Hierarchies *"share a common feature: they are organised systems of
command and obedience"* and so anarchists seek *"to eliminate hierarchy
per se, not simply replace one form of hierarchy with another."*
[Bookchin, **The Ecology of Freedom**, p. 27] A hierarchy is a
pyramidally-structured organisation composed of a series of grades,
ranks, or offices of increasing power, prestige, and (usually)
remuneration. Scholars who have investigated the hierarchical form have
found that the two primary principles it embodies are domination and
exploitation. For example, in his classic article *"What Do Bosses Do?"*
(**Review of Radical Political Economy**, Vol. 6, No. 2), a study of the
modern factory, Steven Marglin found that the main function of the
corporate hierarchy is not greater productive efficiency (as capitalists
claim), but greater control over workers, the purpose of such control
being more effective exploitation.

Control in a hierarchy is maintained by coercion, that is, by the threat
of negative sanctions of one kind or another: physical, economic,
psychological, social, etc. Such control, including the repression of
dissent and rebellion, therefore necessitates centralisation: a set of
power relations in which the greatest control is exercised by the few at
the top (particularly the head of the organisation), while those in the
middle ranks have much less control and the many at the bottom have
virtually none.

Since domination, coercion, and centralisation are essential features of
authoritarianism, and as those features are embodied in hierarchies, all
hierarchical institutions are authoritarian. Moreover, for anarchists,
any organisation marked by hierarchy, centralism and authoritarianism is
state-like, or "statist." And as anarchists oppose both the state and
authoritarian relations, anyone who does not seek to dismantle **all**
forms of hierarchy cannot be called an anarchist. This applies to
capitalist firms. As Noam Chomsky points out, the structure of the
capitalist firm is extremely hierarchical, indeed fascist, in nature:

> "a fascist system. . . [is] absolutist - power goes from top down . .
> . the ideal state is top down control with the public essentially
> following orders.
> "Let's take a look at a corporation. . . [I]f you look at what they
> are, power goes strictly top down, from the board of directors to
> managers to lower managers to ultimately the people on the shop floor,
> typing messages, and so on. There's no flow of power or planning from
> the bottom up. People can disrupt and make suggestions, but the same
> is true of a slave society. The structure of power is linear, from the
> top down." [**Keeping the Rabble in Line**, p. 237]

David Deleon indicates these similarities between the company and the
state well when he writes:

> *"Most factories are like military dictatorships. Those at the bottom
> are privates, the supervisors are sergeants, and on up through the
> hierarchy. The organisation can dictate everything from our clothing

> Where We Work: A rationale for social self-management"*, **Reinventing
> Anarchy, Again**, Howard J. Ehrlich (ed.), pp. 193-4]

Thus the consistent anarchist must oppose hierarchy in all its forms,
including the capitalist firm. Not to do so is to support ***archy*** --
which an anarchist, by definition, cannot do. In other words, for
anarchists, *"[p]romises to obey, contracts of (wage) slavery,
agreements requiring the acceptance of a subordinate status, are all
illegitimate because they do restrict and restrain individual
autonomy."* [Robert Graham, *"The Anarchist Contract*, **Reinventing
Anarchy, Again**, Howard J. Ehrlich (ed.), p. 77] Hierarchy, therefore,
is against the basic principles which drive anarchism. It denies what
makes us human and *"divest[s] the personality of its most integral
traits; it denies the very notion that the individual is **competent**
to deal not only with the management of his or her personal life but
with its most important context: the **social** context."* [Murray
Bookchin, **Op. Cit.**, p. 202]

Some argue that as long as an association is voluntary, whether it has a
hierarchical structure is irrelevant. Anarchists disagree. This is for
two reasons. Firstly, under capitalism workers are driven by economic
necessity to sell their labour (and so liberty) to those who own the
means of life. This process re-enforces the economic conditions workers
face by creating *"massive disparities in wealth . . . [as] workers. . .
sell their labour to the capitalist at a price which does not reflect
its real value."* Therefore:

> *"To portray the parties to an employment contract, for example, as
> free and equal to each other is to ignore the serious inequality of
> bargaining power which exists between the worker and the employer. To
> then go on to portray the relationship of subordination and
> exploitation which naturally results as the epitome of freedom is to
> make a mockery of both individual liberty and social justice."*
> [Robert Graham, **Op. Cit.**, p. 70]

It is for this reason that anarchists support collective action and
organisation: it increases the bargaining power of working people and
allows them to assert their autonomy (see [section J](secJcon.html)).

Secondly, if we take the key element as being whether an association is
voluntary or not we would have to argue that the current state system
must be considered as "anarchy." In a modern democracy no one forces an
individual to live in a specific state. We are free to leave and go
somewhere else. By ignoring the hierarchical nature of an association,
you can end up supporting organisations based upon the denial of freedom
(including capitalist companies, the armed forces, states even) all
because they are "voluntary." As Bob Black argues, *"[t]o demonise state
authoritarianism while ignoring identical albeit contract-consecrated
subservient arrangements in the large-scale corporations which control
the world economy is fetishism at its worst."* [*The Libertarian as
Conservative,* **The Abolition of Work and other essays**, p. 142]
Anarchy is more than being free to pick a master.

Therefore opposition to hierarchy is a key anarchist position, otherwise
you just become a "voluntary archist" - which is hardly anarchistic. For
more on this see section A.2.14 ([Why is voluntarism not
enough?](secA2.html#seca214)).

Anarchists argue that organisations do not need to be hierarchical, they
can be based upon co-operation between equals who manage their own
affairs directly. In this way we can do without hierarchical structures
(i.e. the delegation of power in the hands of a few). Only when an
association is self-managed by its members can it be considered truly
anarchistic.

We are sorry to belabour this point, but some capitalist apologists,
apparently wanting to appropriate the "anarchist" name because of its
association with freedom, have recently claimed that one can be both a
capitalist and an anarchist at the same time (as in so-called "anarcho"
capitalism). It should now be clear that since capitalism is based on
hierarchy (not to mention statism and exploitation),
"anarcho"-capitalism is a contradiction in terms. (For more on this, see
[Section F](secFcon.html))

A.2.9 What sort of society do anarchists want?
----------------------------------------------

Anarchists desire a decentralised society, based on free association. We
consider this form of society the best one for maximising the values we
have outlined above -- liberty, equality and solidarity. Only by a
rational decentralisation of power, both structurally and territorially,
can individual liberty be fostered and encouraged. The delegation of
power into the hands of a minority is an obvious denial of individual
liberty and dignity. Rather than taking the management of their own
affairs away from people and putting it in the hands of others,
anarchists favour organisations which minimise authority, keeping power
at the base, in the hands of those who are affected by any decisions
reached.

Free association is the cornerstone of an anarchist society. Individuals
must be free to join together as they see fit, for this is the basis of
freedom and human dignity. However, any such free agreement must be
based on decentralisation of power; otherwise it will be a sham (as in
capitalism), as only equality provides the necessary social context for
freedom to grow and development. Therefore anarchists support directly
democratic collectives, based on "one person one vote" (for the
rationale of direct democracy as the political counterpart of free
agreement, see section A.2.11 -- [Why do most anarchists support direct
democracy?](secA2.html#seca211)).

We should point out here that an anarchist society does not imply some
sort of idyllic state of harmony within which everyone agrees. Far from
it! As Luigi Galleani points out, *"[d]isagreements and friction will
always exist. In fact they are an essential condition of unlimited
progress. But once the bloody area of sheer animal competition - the
struggle for food - has been eliminated, problems of disagreement could
be solved without the slightest threat to the social order and
individual liberty."* [**The End of Anarchism?**, p. 28] Anarchism aims
to *"rouse the spirit of initiative in individuals and in groups."*
These will *"create in their mutual relations a movement and a life
based on the principles of free understanding"* and recognise that
*"**variety, conflict even, is life and that uniformity is death.**"*
[Peter Kropotkin, **Anarchism**, p. 143]

Therefore, an anarchist society will be based upon co-operative conflict
as *"[c]onflict, per se, is not harmful. . . disagreements exist [and
should not be hidden] . . . What makes disagreement destructive is not
the fact of conflict itself but the addition of competition."* Indeed,
*"a rigid demand for agreement means that people will effectively be
prevented from contributing their wisdom to a group effort."* [Alfie
Kohn, **No Contest: The Case Against Competition**, p. 156] It is for
this reason that most anarchists reject consensus decision making in
large groups (see section [A.2.12](secA2.html#seca212)).

So, in an anarchist society associations would be run by mass assemblies
of all involved, based upon extensive discussion, debate and
co-operative conflict between equals, with purely administrative tasks
being handled by elected committees. These committees would be made up
of mandated, recallable and temporary delegates who carry out their
tasks under the watchful eyes of the assembly which elected them. Thus
in an anarchist society, *"we'll look after our affairs ourselves and
decide what to do about them. And when, to put our ideas into action,
there is a need to put someone in charge of a project, we'll tell them
to do [it] in such and such a way and no other . . . nothing would be
done without our decision. So our delegates, instead of people being
individuals whom we've given the right to order us about, would be
people . . . [with] no authority, only the duty to carry out what
everyone involved wanted."* [Errico Malatesta, **Fra Contadini**, p. 34]
If the delegates act against their mandate or try to extend their
influence or work beyond that already decided by the assembly (i.e. if
they start to make policy decisions), they can be instantly recalled and
their decisions abolished. In this way, the organisation remains in the
hands of the union of individuals who created it.

This self-management by the members of a group at the base and the power
of recall are essential tenets of any anarchist organisation. The
**key** difference between a statist or hierarchical system and an
anarchist community is who wields power. In a parliamentary system, for
example, people give power to a group of representatives to make
decisions for them for a fixed period of time. Whether they carry out
their promises is irrelevant as people cannot recall them till the next
election. Power lies at the top and those at the base are expected to
obey. Similarly, in the capitalist workplace, power is held by an
unelected minority of bosses and managers at the top and the workers are
expected to obey.

In an anarchist society this relationship is reversed. No one individual
or group (elected or unelected) holds power in an anarchist community.
Instead decisions are made using direct democratic principles and, when
required, the community can elect or appoint delegates to carry out
these decisions. There is a clear distinction between policy making
(which lies with everyone who is affected) and the co-ordination and
administration of any adopted policy (which is the job for delegates).

These egalitarian communities, founded by free agreement, also freely
associate together in confederations. Such a free confederation would be
run from the bottom up, with decisions following from the elemental
assemblies upwards. The confederations would be run in the same manner
as the collectives. There would be regular local regional, "national"
and international conferences in which all important issues and problems
affecting the collectives involved would be discussed. In addition, the
fundamental, guiding principles and ideas of society would be debated
and policy decisions made, put into practice, reviewed, and
co-ordinated. The delegates would simply *"take their given mandates to
the relative meetings and try to harmonise their various needs and
desires. The deliberations would always be subject to the control and
approval of those who delegated them"* and so *"there would be no danger
than the interest of the people [would] be forgotten."* [Malatesta,
**Op. Cit.**, p. 36]

Action committees would be formed, if required, to co-ordinate and
administer the decisions of the assemblies and their congresses, under
strict control from below as discussed above. Delegates to such bodies
would have a limited tenure and, like the delegates to the congresses,
have a fixed mandate -- they are not able to make decisions on behalf of
the people they are delegates for. In addition, like the delegates to
conferences and congresses, they would be subject to instant recall by
the assemblies and congresses from which they emerged in the first
place. In this way any committees required to co-ordinate join
activities would be, to quote Malatesta's words, *"always under the
direct control of the population"* and so express the *"decisions taken
at popular assemblies."* [**Errico Malatesta: His Life and Ideas**, p.
175 and p. 129]

Most importantly, the basic community assemblies can overturn any
decisions reached by the conferences and withdraw from any
confederation. Any compromises that are made by a delegate during
negotiations have to go back to a general assembly for ratification.
Without that ratification any compromises that are made by a delegate
are not binding on the community that has delegated a particular task to
a particular individual or committee. In addition, they can call
confederal conferences to discuss new developments and to inform action
committees about changing wishes and to instruct them on what to do
about any developments and ideas.

In other words, any delegates required within an anarchist organisation
or society are **not** representatives (as they are in a democratic
government). Kropotkin makes the difference clear:

> *"The question of true delegation versus representation can be better
> understood if one imagines a hundred or two hundred men [and women],
> who meet each day in their work and share common concerns . . . who
> have discussed every aspect of the question that concerns them and
> have reached a decision. They then choose someone and send him [or
> her] to reach an agreement with other delegates of the same kind. . .
> The delegate is not authorised to do more than explain to other
> delegates the considerations that have led his [or her] colleagues to
> their conclusion. Not being able to impose anything, he [or she] will
> seek an understanding and will return with a simple proposition which
> his mandatories can accept or refuse. This is what happens when true
> delegation comes into being."* [**Words of a Rebel**, p. 132]

Unlike in a representative system, **power** is not delegated into the
hands of the few. Rather, any delegate is simply a mouthpiece for the
association that elected (or otherwise selected) them in the first
place. All delegates and action committees would be mandated and subject
to instant recall to ensure they express the wishes of the assemblies
they came from rather than their own. In this way government is replaced
by anarchy, a network of free associations and communities co-operating
as equals based on a system of mandated delegates, instant recall, free
agreement and free federation from the bottom up.

Only this system would ensure the *"free organisation of the people, an
organisation from below upwards."* This *"free federation from below
upward"* would start with the basic *"association"* and their federation
*"first into a commune, then a federation of communes into regions, of
regions into nations, and of nations into an international fraternal
association."* [Michael Bakunin, **The Political Philosophy of
Bakunin**, p. 298] This network of anarchist communities would work on
three levels. There would be *"independent Communes for the territorial
organisation, and of federations of Trade Unions [i.e. workplace
associations] for the organisation of men [and women] in accordance with
their different functions. . . [and] free combines and societies . . .
for the satisfaction of all possible and imaginable needs, economic,
sanitary, and educational; for mutual protection, for the propaganda of
ideas, for arts, for amusement, and so on."* [Peter Kropotkin,
**Evolution and Environment**, p. 79] All would be based on
self-management, free association, free federation and self-organisation
from the bottom up.

By organising in this manner, hierarchy is abolished in all aspects of
life, because the people at the base of the organisation are in control,
**not** their delegates. Only this form of organisation can replace
government (the initiative and empowerment of the few) with anarchy (the
initiative and empowerment of all). This form of organisation would
exist in all activities which required group work and the co-ordination
of many people. It would be, as Bakunin said, the means *"to integrate
individuals into structures which they could understand and control."*
[quoted by Cornelius Castoriadis, **Political and Social Writings**,
vol. 2, p. 97] For individual initiatives, the individual involved would
manage them.

As can be seen, anarchists wish to create a society based upon
structures that ensure that no individual or group is able to wield
power over others. Free agreement, confederation and the power of
recall, fixed mandates and limited tenure are mechanisms by which power
is removed from the hands of governments and placed in the hands of
those directly affected by the decisions.

For a fuller discussion on what an anarchist society would look like see
[section I](secIcon.html). Anarchy, however, is not some distant goal
but rather an aspect of current struggles against oppression and
exploitation. Means and ends are linked, with direct action generating
mass participatory organisations and preparing people to directly manage
their own personal and collective interests. This is because anarchists,
as we discuss in [section I.2.3](secI2.html#seci23), see the framework
of a free society being based on the organisations created by the
oppressed in their struggle against capitalism in the here and now. In
this sense, collective struggle creates the organisations as well as the
individual attitudes anarchism needs to work. The struggle against
oppression is the school of anarchy. It teaches us not only how to be
anarchists but also gives us a glimpse of what an anarchist society
would be like, what its initial organisational framework could be and
the experience of managing our own activities which is required for such
a society to work. As such, anarchists try to create the kind of world
we want in our current struggles and do not think our ideas are only
applicable "after the revolution." Indeed, by applying our principles
today we bring anarchy that much nearer.

A.2.10 What will abolishing hierarchy mean and achieve?
-------------------------------------------------------

The creation of a new society based upon libertarian organisations will
have an incalculable effect on everyday life. The empowerment of
millions of people will transform society in ways we can only guess at
now.

However, many consider these forms of organisation as impractical and
doomed to failure. To those who say that such confederal,
non-authoritarian organisations would produce confusion and disunity,
anarchists maintain that the statist, centralised and hierarchical form
of organisation produces indifference instead of involvement,
heartlessness instead of solidarity, uniformity instead of unity, and
privileged elites instead of equality. More importantly, such
organisations destroy individual initiative and crush independent action
and critical thinking. (For more on hierarchy, see section B.1 -- ["Why
are anarchists against authority and hierarchy?"](secB1.html)).

That libertarian organisation can work and is based upon (and promotes)
liberty was demonstrated in the Spanish Anarchist movement. Fenner
Brockway, Secretary of the British Independent Labour Party, when
visiting Barcelona during the 1936 revolution, noted that *"the great
solidarity that existed among the Anarchists was due to each individual
relying on his [sic] own strength and not depending upon leadership. . .
. The organisations must, to be successful, be combined with
free-thinking people; not a mass, but free individuals"* [quoted by
Rudolf Rocker, **Anarcho-syndicalism**, p. 67f]

As sufficiently indicated already, hierarchical, centralised structures
restrict freedom. As Proudhon noted: *"the centralist system is all very
well as regards size, simplicity and construction: it lacks but one
thing -- the individual no longer belongs to himself in such a system,
he cannot feel his worth, his life, and no account is taken of him at
all."* [quoted by Martin Buber, **Paths in Utopia**, p. 33]

The effects of hierarchy can be seen all around us. It does not work.
Hierarchy and authority exist everywhere, in the workplace, at home, in
the street. As Bob Black puts it, *"[i]f you spend most of your waking
life taking orders or kissing ass, if you get habituated to hierarchy,
you will become passive-aggressive, sado-masochistic, servile and
stupefied, and you will carry that load into every aspect of the balance
of your life."* [*"The Libertarian as Conservative,"* **The Abolition of
Work and other essays**, pp. 147-8]

This means that the end of hierarchy will mean a **massive**
transformation in everyday life. It will involve the creation of
individual-centred organisations within which all can exercise, and so
develop, their abilities to the fullest. By involving themselves and
participating in the decisions that affect them, their workplace, their
community and society, they can ensure the full development of their
individual capacities.

With the free participation of all in social life, we would quickly see
the end of inequality and injustice. Rather than people existing to make
ends meet and being used to increase the wealth and power of the few as
under capitalism, the end of hierarchy would see (to quote Kropotkin)
*"the well-being of all"* and it is *"high time for the worker to assert
his [or her] right to the common inheritance, and to enter into
possession of it."* [**The Conquest of Bread**, p. 35 and p. 44] For
only taking possession of the means of life (workplaces, housing, the
land, etc.) can ensure *"liberty and justice, for liberty and justice
are not decreed but are the result of economic independence. They spring
from the fact that the individual is able to live without depending on a
master, and to enjoy . . . the product of his [or her] toil."* [Ricardo
Flores Magon, **Land and Liberty**, p. 62] Therefore liberty requires
the abolition of capitalist private property rights in favour of ***"use
rights."*** (see [section B.3](secB3.html) for more details).
Ironically, the *"abolition of property will free the people from
homelessness and nonpossession."* [Max Baginski, *"Without Government,"*
**Anarchy! An Anthology of Emma Goldman's Mother Earth**, p. 11] Thus
anarchism promises *"both requisites of happiness -- liberty and
wealth."* In anarchy, *"mankind will live in freedom and in comfort."*
[Benjamin Tucker, **Why I am an Anarchist**, p. 135 and p. 136]

Only self-determination and free agreement on every level of society can
develop the responsibility, initiative, intellect and solidarity of
individuals and society as a whole. Only anarchist organisation allows
the vast talent which exists within humanity to be accessed and used,
enriching society by the very process of enriching and developing the
individual. Only by involving everyone in the process of thinking,
planning, co-ordinating and implementing the decisions that affect them
can freedom blossom and individuality be fully developed and protected.
Anarchy will release the creativity and talent of the mass of people
enslaved by hierarchy.

Anarchy will even be of benefit for those who are said to benefit from
capitalism and its authority relations. Anarchists *"maintain that
**both** rulers and ruled are spoiled by authority; **both** exploiters
and exploited are spoiled by exploitation."* [Peter Kropotkin, **Act for
Yourselves**, p. 83] This is because *"[i]n any hierarchical
relationship the dominator as well as the submissive pays his dues. The
price paid for the 'glory of command' is indeed heavy. Every tyrant
resents his duties. He is relegated to drag the dead weight of the
dormant creative potential of the submissive all along the road of his
hierarchical excursion."* [For Ourselves, **The Right to Be Greedy**,
Thesis 95]

A.2.11 Why are most anarchists in favour of direct democracy?
-------------------------------------------------------------

For most anarchists, direct democratic voting on policy decisions within
free associations is the political counterpart of free agreement (this
is also known as ***"self-management"***). The reason is that *"many
forms of domination can be carried out in a 'free.' non-coercive,
contractual manner. . . and it is naive. . . to think that mere
opposition to political control will in itself lead to an end of
oppression."* [John P. Clark, **Max Stirner's Egoism**, p. 93] Thus the
relationships we create **within** an organisation is as important in
determining its libertarian nature as its voluntary nature (see [section
A.2.14](secA2.html#seca214) for more discussion).

It is obvious that individuals must work together in order to lead a
fully human life. And so, *"[h]aving to join with others humans"* the
individual has three options: *"he [or she] must submit to the will of
others (be enslaved) or subject others to his will (be in authority) or
live with others in fraternal agreement in the interests of the greatest
good of all (be an associate). Nobody can escape from this necessity."*
[Errico Malatesta, **Life and Ideas**, p. 85]

Anarchists obviously pick the last option, association, as the only
means by which individuals can work together as free and equal human
beings, respecting the uniqueness and liberty of one another. Only
within direct democracy can individuals express themselves, practice
critical thought and self-government, so developing their intellectual
and ethical capacities to the full. In terms of increasing an
individual's freedom and their intellectual, ethical and social
faculties, it is far better to be sometimes in a minority than be
subject to the will of a boss all the time. So what is the theory behind
anarchist direct democracy?

As Bertrand Russell noted, the anarchist *"does not wish to abolish
government in the sense of collective decisions: what he does wish to
abolish is the system by which a decision is enforced upon those who
oppose it."* [**Roads to Freedom**, p. 85] Anarchists see
self-management as the means to achieve this. Once an individual joins a
community or workplace, he or she becomes a "citizen" (for want of a
better word) of that association. The association is organised around an
assembly of all its members (in the case of large workplaces and towns,
this may be a functional sub-group such as a specific office or
neighbourhood). In this assembly, in concert with others, the contents
of his or her political obligations are defined. In acting within the
association, people must exercise critical judgement and choice, i.e.
manage their own activity. Rather than promising to obey (as in
hierarchical organisations like the state or capitalist firm),
individuals participate in making their own collective decisions, their
own commitments to their fellows. This means that political obligation
is not owed to a separate entity above the group or society, such as the
state or company, but to one's fellow "citizens."

Although the assembled people collectively legislate the rules governing
their association, and are bound by them as individuals, they are also
superior to them in the sense that these rules can always be modified or
repealed. Collectively, the associated "citizens" constitute a political
"authority", but as this "authority" is based on horizontal
relationships between themselves rather than vertical ones between
themselves and an elite, the "authority" is non-hierarchical ("rational"
or "natural," see section B.1 - ["Why are anarchists against authority
and hierarchy?"](secB1.html) - for more on this). Thus Proudhon:

> *"In place of laws, we will put contracts [i.e. free agreement]. - No
> more laws voted by a majority, nor even unanimously; each citizen,
> each town, each industrial union, makes its own laws."* [**The General
> Idea of the Revolution**, pp. 245-6]

Such a system does not mean, of course, that everyone participates in
every decision needed, no matter how trivial. While any decision can be
put to the assembly (if the assembly so decides, perhaps prompted by
some of its members), in practice certain activities (and so purely
functional decisions) will be handled by the association's elected
administration. This is because, to quote a Spanish anarchist activist,
*"a collectivity as such cannot write a letter or add up a list of
figures or do hundreds of chores which only an individual can perform."*
Thus the need *"to **organise the administration.**"* Supposing an
association is *"organised without any directive council or any
hierarchical offices"* which *"meets in general assembly once a week or
more often, when it settles all matters needful for its progress"* it
still *"nominates a commission with **strictly administrative
functions.**"* However, the assembly *"prescribes a definite line of
conduct for this commission or gives it an **imperative mandate**"* and
so *"would be **perfectly anarchist.**"* As it *"follows that
**delegating** these tasks to qualified individuals, who are
**instructed in advance how to proceed,** . . . does not mean an
abdication of that collectivity's own liberty."* [Jose Llunas Pujols,
quoted by Max Nettlau, **A Short History of Anarchism**, p. 187] This,
it should be noted, follows Proudhon's ideas that within the workers'
associations *"all positions are elective, and the by-laws subject to
the approval of the members."* [Proudhon, **Op. Cit.**, p. 222]

Instead of capitalist or statist hierarchy, self-management (i.e. direct
democracy) would be the guiding principle of the freely joined
associations that make up a free society. This would apply to the
federations of associations an anarchist society would need to function.
*"All the commissions or delegations nominated in an anarchist
society,"* correctly argued Jose Llunas Pujols, *"must be subject to
replacement and recall at any time by the permanent suffrage of the
section or sections that elected them."* Combined with the *"imperative
mandate"* and *"purely administrative functions,"* this *"make[s] it
thereby impossible for anyone to arrogate to himself [or herself] a
scintilla of authority."* [quoted by Max Nettlau, **Op. Cit.**, pp.
188-9] Again, Pujols follows Proudhon who demanded twenty years
previously the *"implementation of the binding mandate"* to ensure the
people do not *"adjure their sovereignty."* [**No Gods, No Masters**,
vol. 1, p. 63]

By means of a federalism based on mandates and elections, anarchists
ensure that decisions flow from the bottom-up. By making our own
decisions, by looking after our joint interests ourselves, we exclude
others ruling over us. Self-management, for anarchists, is essential to
ensure freedom within the organisations so needed for any decent human
existence.

Of course it could be argued that if you are in a minority, you are
governed by others (*"Democratic rule is still rule"* [L. Susan Brown,
**The Politics of Individualism**, p. 53]). Now, the concept of direct
democracy as we have described it is not necessarily tied to the concept
of majority rule. If someone finds themselves in a minority on a
particular vote, he or she is confronted with the choice of either
consenting or refusing to recognise it as binding. To deny the minority
the opportunity to exercise its judgement and choice is to infringe its
autonomy and to impose obligation upon it which it has not freely
accepted. The coercive imposition of the majority will is contrary to
the ideal of self-assumed obligation, and so is contrary to direct
democracy and free association. Therefore, far from being a denial of
freedom, direct democracy within the context of free association and
self-assumed obligation is the only means by which liberty can be
nurtured (*"Individual autonomy limited by the obligation to hold given
promises."* [Malatesta, quoted by quoted by Max Nettlau, **Errico
Malatesta: The Biography of an Anarchist**]). Needless to say, a
minority, if it remains in the association, can argue its case and try
to convince the majority of the error of its ways.

And we must point out here that anarchist support for direct democracy
does not suggest we think that the majority is always right. Far from
it! The case for democratic participation is not that the majority is
always right, but that no minority can be trusted not to prefer its own
advantage to the good of the whole. History proves what common-sense
predicts, namely that anyone with dictatorial powers (by they a head of
state, a boss, a husband, whatever) will use their power to enrich and
empower themselves at the expense of those subject to their decisions.

Anarchists recognise that majorities can and do make mistakes and that
is why our theories on association place great importance on minority
rights. This can be seen from our theory of self-assumed obligation,
which bases itself on the right of minorities to protest against
majority decisions and makes dissent a key factor in decision making.
Thus Carole Pateman:

> *"If the majority have acted in bad faith. . . [then the] minority
> will have to take political action, including politically disobedient
> action if appropriate, to defend their citizenship and independence,
> and the political association itself. . . Political disobedience is
> merely one possible expression of the active citizenship on which a
> self-managing democracy is based . . . The social practice of
> promising involves the right to refuse or change commitments;
> similarly, the practice of self-assumed political obligation is
> meaningless without the practical recognition of the right of
> minorities to refuse or withdraw consent, or where necessary, to
> disobey."* [**The Problem of Political Obligation**, p. 162]

Moving beyond relationships within associations, we must highlight how
different associations work together. As would be imagined, the links
between associations follow the same outlines as for the associations
themselves. Instead of individuals joining an association, we have
associations joining confederations. The links between associations in
the confederation are of the same horizontal and voluntary nature as
within associations, with the same rights of "voice and exit" for
members and the same rights for minorities. In this way society becomes
an association of associations, a community of communities, a commune of
communes, based upon maximising individual freedom by maximising
participation and self-management.

The workings of such a confederation are outlined in section A.2.9
([What sort of society do anarchists want?](secA2.html#seca29)) and
discussed in greater detail in section I ([What would an anarchist
society look like?](secIcon.html)).

This system of direct democracy fits nicely into anarchist theory.
Malatesta speaks for all anarchists when he argued that *"anarchists
deny the right of the majority to govern human society in general."* As
can be seen, the majority has no right to enforce itself on a minority
-- the minority can leave the association at any time and so, to use
Malatesta's words, do not have to *"submit to the decisions of the
majority before they have even heard what these might be."* [**The
Anarchist Revolution**, p. 100 and p. 101] Hence, direct democracy
within voluntary association does not create "majority rule" nor assume
that the minority must submit to the majority no matter what. In effect,
anarchist supporters of direct democracy argue that it fits Malatesta's
argument that:

> *"Certainly anarchists recognise that where life is lived in common it
> is often necessary for the minority to come to accept the opinion of
> the majority. When there is an obvious need or usefulness in doing
> something and, to do it requires the agreement of all, the few should
> feel the need to adapt to the wishes of the many . . . But such
> adaptation on the one hand by one group must be on the other be
> reciprocal, voluntary and must stem from an awareness of need and of
> goodwill to prevent the running of social affairs from being paralysed
> by obstinacy. It cannot be imposed as a principle and statutory norm.
> . ."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 100]

As the minority has the right to secede from the association as well as
having extensive rights of action, protest and appeal, majority rule is
not imposed as a principle. Rather, it is purely a decision making tool
which allows minority dissent and opinion to be expressed (and acted
upon) while ensuring that no minority forces its will on the majority.
In other words, majority decisions are not binding on the minority.
After all, as Malatesta argued:

> *"one cannot expect, or even wish, that someone who is firmly
> convinced that the course taken by the majority leads to disaster,
> should sacrifice his [or her] own convictions and passively look on,
> or even worse, should support a policy he [or she] considers wrong."*
> [**Errico Malatesta: His Life and Ideas**, p. 132]

Even the Individual Anarchist Lysander Spooner acknowledged that direct
democracy has its uses when he noted that *"[a]ll, or nearly all,
voluntary associations give a majority, or some other portion of the
members less than the whole, the right to use some **limited**
discretion as to the **means** to be used to accomplish the ends in
view."* However, only the unanimous decision of a jury (which would
*"judge the law, and the justice of the law"*) could determine
individual rights as this *"tribunal fairly represent[s] the whole
people"* as *"no law can rightfully be enforced by the association in
its corporate capacity, against the goods, rights, or person of any
individual, except it be such as **all** members of the association
agree that it may enforce"* (his support of juries results from Spooner
acknowledging that it *"would be impossible in practice"* for **all**
members of an association to agree) [**Trial by Jury**, p. 130-1f, p.
134, p. 214, p. 152 and p. 132]

Thus direct democracy and individual/minority rights need not clash. In
practice, we can imagine direct democracy would be used to make most
decisions within most associations (perhaps with super-majorities
required for fundamental decisions) plus some combination of a jury
system and minority protest/direct action and evaluate/protect minority
claims/rights in an anarchist society. The actual forms of freedom can
only be created through practical experience by the people directly
involved.

Lastly, we must stress that anarchist support for direct democracy does
not mean that this solution is to be favoured in all circumstances. For
example, many small associations may favour consensus decision making
(see the [next section](secA2.html#seca212) on consensus and why most
anarchists do not think that it is a viable alternative to direct
democracy). However, most anarchists think that direct democracy within
free association is the best (and most realistic) form of organisation
which is consistent with anarchist principles of individual freedom,
dignity and equality.

A.2.12 Is consensus an alternative to direct democracy?
-------------------------------------------------------

The few anarchists who reject direct democracy within free associations
generally support consensus in decision making. Consensus is based upon
everyone on a group agreeing to a decision before it can be put into
action. Thus, it is argued, consensus stops the majority ruling the
minority and is more consistent with anarchist principles.

Consensus, although the "best" option in decision making, as all agree,
has its problems. As Murray Bookchin points out in describing his
experience of consensus, it can have authoritarian implications:

> *"In order. . . to create full consensus on a decision, minority
> dissenters were often subtly urged or psychologically coerced to
> decline to vote on a troubling issue, inasmuch as their dissent would
> essentially amount to a one-person veto. This practice, called
> 'standing aside' in American consensus processes, all too often
> involved intimidation of the dissenters, to the point that they
> completely withdrew from the decision-making process, rather than make
> an honourable and continuing expression of their dissent by voting,
> even as a minority, in accordance with their views. Having withdrawn,
> they ceased to be political beings--so that a 'decision' could be
> made. . . . 'consensus' was ultimately achieved only after dissenting
> members nullified themselves as participants in the process.*
> *"On a more theoretical level, consensus silenced that most vital
> aspect of all dialogue, **dissensus**. The ongoing dissent, the
> passionate dialogue that still persists even after a minority accedes
> temporarily to a majority decision,. . . [can be] replaced. . . .by
> dull monologues -- and the uncontroverted and deadening tone of
> consensus. In majority decision-making, the defeated minority can
> resolve to overturn a decision on which they have been defeated --
> they are free to openly and persistently articulate reasoned and
> potentially persuasive disagreements. Consensus, for its part, honours
> no minorities, but mutes them in favour of the metaphysical 'one' of
> the 'consensus' group."* [*"Communalism: The Democratic Dimension of
> Anarchism"*, **Democracy and Nature**, no. 8, p. 8]

Bookchin does not *"deny that consensus may be an appropriate form of
decision-making in small groups of people who are thoroughly familiar
with one another."*But he notes that, in practical terms, his own
experience has shown him that *"when larger groups try to make decisions
by consensus, it usually obliges them to arrive at the lowest common
intellectual denominator in their decision-making: the least
controversial or even the most mediocre decision that a sizeable
assembly of people can attain is adopted-- precisely because everyone
must agree with it or else withdraw from voting on that issue"* [**Op.
Cit.**, p.7]

Therefore, due to its potentially authoritarian nature, most anarchists
disagree that consensus is the political aspect of free association.
While it is advantageous to try to reach consensus, it is usually
impractical to do so -- especially in large groups -- regardless of its
other, negative effects. Often it demeans a free society or association
by tending to subvert individuality in the name of community and dissent
in the name of solidarity. Neither true community nor solidarity are
fostered when the individual's development and self-expression are
aborted by public disapproval and pressure. Since individuals are all
unique, they will have unique viewpoints which they should be encouraged
to express, as society evolves and is enriched by the actions and ideas
of individuals.

In other words, anarchist supporters of direct democracy stress the
*"**creative** role of dissent"* which, they fear, *"tends to fade away
in the grey uniformity required by consensus."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 8]

We must stress that anarchists are **not** in favour of a mechanical
decision making process in which the majority just vote the minority
away and ignore them. Far from it! Anarchists who support direct
democracy see it as a dynamic debating process in which majority and
minority listen to and respect each other as far possible and create a
decision which all can live with (if possible). They see the process of
participation within directly democratic associations as the means of
creating common interests, as a process which will encourage diversity,
individual and minority expression and reduce any tendency for
majorities to marginalise or oppress minorities by ensuring discussion
and debate occurs on important issues.

A.2.13 Are anarchists individualists or collectivists?
------------------------------------------------------

The short answer is: neither. This can be seen from the fact that
liberal scholars denounce anarchists like Bakunin for being
"collectivists" while Marxists attack Bakunin and anarchists in general
for being "individualists."

This is hardly surprising, as anarchists reject both ideologies as
nonsense. Whether they like it or not, non-anarchist individualists and
collectivists are two sides of the same capitalist coin. This can best
shown be by considering modern capitalism, in which "individualist" and
"collectivist" tendencies continually interact, often with the political
and economic structure swinging from one pole to the other. Capitalist
collectivism and individualism are both one-sided aspects of human
existence, and like all manifestations of imbalance, deeply flawed.

For anarchists, the idea that individuals should sacrifice themselves
for the "group" or "greater good" is nonsensical. Groups are made up of
individuals, and if people think only of what's best for the group, the
group will be a lifeless shell. It is only the dynamics of human
interaction within groups which give them life. "Groups" cannot think,
only individuals can. This fact, ironically, leads authoritarian
"collectivists" to a most particular kind of "individualism," namely the
*"cult of the personality"*and leader worship. This is to be expected,
since such collectivism lumps individuals into abstract groups, denies
their individuality, and ends up with the need for someone with enough
individuality to make decisions -- a problem that is "solved" by the
leader principle. Stalinism and Nazism are excellent examples of this
phenomenon.

Therefore, anarchists recognise that individuals are the basic unit of
society and that only individuals have interests and feelings. This
means they oppose "collectivism" and the glorification of the group. In
anarchist theory the group exists only to aid and develop the
individuals involved in them. This is why we place so much stress on
groups structured in a libertarian manner -- only a libertarian
organisation allows the individuals within a group to fully express
themselves, manage their own interests directly and to create social
relationships which encourage individuality and individual freedom. So
while society and the groups they join shapes the individual, the
individual is the true basis of society. Hence Malatesta:

> *"Much has been said about the respective roles of individual
> initiative and social action in the life and progress of human
> societies . . . [E]verything is maintained and kept going in the human
> world thanks to individual initiative . . . The real being is man, the
> individual. Society or the collectivity - and the **State** or
> government which claims to represent it - if it is not a hollow
> abstraction, must be made up of individuals. And it is in the organism
> of every individual that all thoughts and human actions inevitably
> have their origin, and from being individual they become collective
> thoughts and acts when they are or become accepted by many
> individuals. Social action, therefore, is neither the negation nor the
> complement of individual initiatives, but is the resultant of
> initiatives, thoughts and actions of all individuals who make up
> society . . . [T]he question is not really changing the relationship
> between society and the individual . . . [I]t is a question of
> preventing some individuals from oppressing others; of giving all
> individuals the same rights and the same means of action; and of
> replacing the initiative to the few [which Malatesta defines as a key
> aspect of government/hierarchy], which inevitably results in the
> oppression of everyone else . . . "* [**Anarchy**, pp. 38-38]

These considerations do not mean that "individualism" finds favour with
anarchists. As Emma Goldman pointed out, *"'rugged individualism'. . .
is only a masked attempt to repress and defeat the individual and his
individuality. So-called Individualism is the social and economic
**laissez-faire**: the exploitation of the masses by the [ruling]
classes by means of legal trickery, spiritual debasement and systematic
indoctrination of the servile spirit . . . That corrupt and perverse
'individualism' is the straitjacket of individuality . . [It] has
inevitably resulted in the greatest modern slavery, the crassest class
distinctions driving millions to the breadline. 'Rugged individualism'
has meant all the 'individualism' for the masters, while the people are
regimented into a slave caste to serve a handful of self-seeking
'supermen.'"* [**Red Emma Speaks**, p. 112]

While groups cannot think, individuals cannot live or discuss by
themselves. Groups and associations are an essential aspect of
individual life. Indeed, as groups generate social relationships by
their very nature, they help **shape** individuals. In other words,
groups structured in an authoritarian way will have a negative impact on
the freedom and individuality of those within them. However, due to the
abstract nature of their "individualism," capitalist individualists fail
to see any difference between groups structured in a libertarian manner
rather than in an authoritarian one -- they are both "groups". Because
of their one-sided perspective on this issue, "individualists"
ironically end up supporting some of the most "collectivist"
institutions in existence -- capitalist companies -- and, moreover,
always find a need for the state despite their frequent denunciations of
it. These contradictions stem from capitalist individualism's dependence
on individual contracts in an unequal society, i.e. **abstract**
individualism.

In contrast, anarchists stress **social** "individualism" (another,
perhaps better, term for this concept could be ***"communal
individuality"***). Anarchism *"insists that the centre of gravity in
society is the individual -- that he [sic] must think for himself, act
freely, and live fully. . . . If he is to develop freely and fully, he
must be relieved from the interference and oppression of others. . . .
[T]his has nothing in common with. . . 'rugged individualism.' Such
predatory individualism is really flabby, not rugged. At the least
danger to its safety, it runs to cover of the state and wails for
protection. . . .Their 'rugged individualism' is simply one of the many
pretences the ruling class makes to mask unbridled business and
political extortion."* [Emma Goldman, **Op. Cit.**, pp. 442-3]

Anarchism rejects the **abstract** individualism of capitalism, with its
ideas of "absolute" freedom of the individual which is constrained by
others. This theory ignores the social context in which freedom exists
and grows. *"The freedom we want,"* Malatesta argued, *"for ourselves
and for others, is not an absolute metaphysical, abstract freedom which
in practice is inevitably translated into the oppression of the weak;
but it is a real freedom, possible freedom, which is the conscious
community of interests, voluntary solidarity."* [**Anarchy**, p. 43]

A society based on abstract individualism results in an inequality of
power between the contracting individuals and so entails the need for an
authority based on laws above them and organised coercion to enforce the
contracts between them. This consequence is evident from capitalism and,
most notably, in the "social contract" theory of how the state
developed. In this theory it is assumed that individuals are "free" when
they are isolated from each other, as they allegedly were originally in
the "state of nature." Once they join society, they supposedly create a
"contract" and a state to administer it. However, besides being a
fantasy with no basis in reality (human beings have **always** been
social animals), this "theory" is actually a justification for the
state's having extensive powers over society; and this in turn is a
justification of the capitalist system, which requires a strong state.
It also mimics the results of the capitalist economic relations upon
which this theory is built. Within capitalism, individuals "freely"
contract together, but in practice the owner rules the worker for as
long as the contract is in place. (See sections
[A.2.14](secA2.html#seca214) and [B.4](secB4.html) for further details).

Thus anarchists reject capitalist "individualism" as being, to quote
Kropotkin, *"a narrow and selfish individualism"* which, moreover, is
*"a foolish egoism which belittles the individual"* and is *"not
individualism at all. It will not lead to what was established as a
goal; that is the complete broad and most perfectly attainable
development of individuality."* The hierarchy of capitalism results in
*"the impoverishment of individuality"* rather than its development. To
this anarchists contrast *"the individuality which attains the greatest
individual development possible through the highest communist
sociability in what concerns both its primordial needs and its
relationships with others in general."* [**Selected Writings on
Anarchism and Revolution**, p. 295, p. 296 and p. 297] For anarchists,
our freedom is enriched by those around us when we work with them as
equals and not as master and servant.

In practice, both individualism and collectivism lead to a denial of
both individual liberty and group autonomy and dynamics. In addition,
each implies the other, with collectivism leading to a particular form
of individualism and individualism leading to a particular form of
collectivism.

Collectivism, with its implicit suppression of the individual,
ultimately impoverishes the community, as groups are only given life by
the individuals who comprise them. Individualism, with its explicit
suppression of community (i.e. the people with whom you live),
ultimately impoverishes the individual, since individuals do not exist
apart from society but can only exist within it. In addition,
individualism ends up denying the "select few" the insights and
abilities of the individuals who make up the rest of society, and so is
a source of self-denial. This is Individualism's fatal flaw (and
contradiction), namely *"the impossibility for the individual to attain
a really full development in the conditions of oppression of the mass by
the 'beautiful aristocracies'. His [or her] development would remain
uni-lateral."* [Peter Kropotkin, **Anarchism**, p. 293]

True liberty and community exist elsewhere.

A.2.14 Why is voluntarism not enough?
-------------------------------------

Voluntarism means that association should be voluntary in order maximise
liberty. Anarchists are, obviously, voluntarists, thinking that only in
free association, created by free agreement, can individuals develop,
grow, and express their liberty. However, it is evident that under
capitalism voluntarism is not enough in itself to maximise liberty.

Voluntarism implies promising (i.e. the freedom to make agreements), and
promising implies that individuals are capable of independent judgement
and rational deliberation. In addition, it presupposes that they can
evaluate and change their actions and relationships. Contracts under
capitalism, however, contradict these implications of voluntarism. For,
while technically "voluntary" (though as we show in [section
B.4,](secB4.html) this is not really the case), capitalist contracts
result in a denial of liberty. This is because the social relationship
of wage-labour involves promising to obey in return for payment. And as
Carole Pateman points out, *"to promise to obey is to deny or to limit,
to a greater or lesser degree, individuals' freedom and equality and
their ability to exercise these capacities [of independent judgement and
rational deliberation]. To promise to obey is to state, that in certain
areas, the person making the promise is no longer free to exercise her
capacities and decide upon her own actions, and is no longer equal, but
subordinate."* [**The Problem of Political Obligation**, p. 19] This
results in those obeying no longer making their own decisions. Thus the
rational for voluntarism (i.e. that individuals are capable of thinking
for themselves and must be allowed to express their individuality and
make their own decisions) is violated in a hierarchical relationship as
some are in charge and the many obey (see also [section
A.2.8](secA2.html#seca28)). Thus any voluntarism which generates
relationships of subordination is, by its very nature, incomplete and
violates its own justification.

This can be seen from capitalist society, in which workers sell their
freedom to a boss in order to live. In effect, under capitalism you are
only free to the extent that you can choose whom you will obey! Freedom,
however, must mean more than the right to change masters. Voluntary
servitude is still servitude. For if, as Rousseau put it, sovereignty,
*"for the same reason as makes it inalienable, cannot be represented"*
neither can it be sold nor temporarily nullified by a hiring contract.
Rousseau famously argued that the *"people of England regards itself as
free; but it is grossly mistaken; it is free only during the election of
members of parliament. As soon as they are elected, slavery overtakes
it, and it is nothing."* [**The Social Contract and Discourses**, p.
266] Anarchists expand on this analysis. To paraphrase Rousseau:

> Under capitalism the worker regards herself as free; but she is
> grossly mistaken; she is free only when she signs her contract with
> her boss. As soon as it is signed, slavery overtakes her and she is
> nothing but an order taker.

To see why, to see the injustice, we need only quote Rousseau:

> *"That a rich and powerful man, having acquired immense possessions in
> land, should impose laws on those who want to establish themselves
> there, and that he should only allow them to do so on condition that
> they accept his supreme authority and obey all his wishes; that, I can
> still conceive . . . Would not this tyrannical act contain a double
> usurpation: that on the ownership of the land and that on the liberty
> of the inhabitants?"* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 316]

Hence Proudhon's comment that *"Man may be made by property a slave or a
despot by turns."* [**What is Property?**, p. 371] Little wonder we
discover Bakunin rejecting *"any contract with another individual on any
footing but the utmost equality and reciprocity"* as this would
*"alienate his [or her] freedom"* and so would be a *"a relationship of
voluntary servitude with another individual."* Anyone making such a
contract in a free society (i.e. anarchist society) would be *"devoid of
any sense of personal dignity."* [**Michael Bakunin: Selected
Writings**, pp. 68-9] Only self-managed associations can create
relationships of equality rather than of subordination between its
members.

Therefore anarchists stress the need for direct democracy in voluntary
associations in order to ensure that the concept of "freedom" is not a
sham and a justification for domination, as it is under capitalism. Only
self-managed associations can create relationships of equality rather
than of subordination between its members.

It is for this reason that anarchists have opposed capitalism and urged
*"workers to form themselves into democratic societies, with equal
conditions for all members, on pain of a relapse into feudalism."*
[Proudhon, **The General Idea of the Revolution**, p. 277] For similar
reasons, anarchists (with the notable exception of Proudhon) opposed
marriage as it turned women into *"a bonded slave, who takes her
master's name, her master's bread, her master's commands, and serves her
master's passions . . . who can control no property, not even her own
body, without his consent."* [Voltairine de Cleyre, *"Sex Slavery"*,
**The Voltairine de Cleyre Reader**, p. 94] While marriage, due to
feminist agitation, in many countries has been reformed towards the
anarchist ideal of a free union of equals, it still is based on the
patriarchal principles anarchists like Goldman and de Cleyre identified
and condemned (see [section A.3.5](secA3.html#seca35) for more on
feminism and anarchism).

Clearly, voluntary entry is a necessary but not a sufficient condition
to defend an individual's liberty. This is to be expected as it ignores
(or takes for granted) the social conditions in which agreements are
made and, moreover, ignores the social relationships created by them
(*"For the worker who **must sell** his labour, it is impossible to
remain **free.**"* [Kropotkin, **Selected Writings on Anarchism and
Revolution**, p. 305]). Any social relationships based on abstract
individualism are likely to be based upon force, power, and authority,
**not** liberty. This of course assumes a definition of liberty
according to which individuals exercise their capacities and decide
their own actions. Therefore, voluntarism is **not** enough to create a
society that maximises liberty. This is why anarchists think that
voluntary association **must** be complemented by self-management
(direct democracy) **within** these associations. For anarchists, the
assumptions of voluntarism imply self-management. Or, to use Proudhon's
words, *"as individualism is the primordial fact of humanity, so
association is its complementary term."* [**System of Economical
Contradictions**, p. 430]

To answer the second objection first, in a society based on private
property (and so statism), those with property have more power, which
they can use to perpetuate their authority. *"Wealth is power, poverty
is weakness,"* in the words of Albert Parsons. This means that under
capitalism the much praised "freedom to choose" is extremely limited. It
becomes, for the vast majority, the freedom to pick a master (under
slavery, quipped Parsons, the master *"selected . . . his own slaves.
Under the wage slavery system the wage slave selects his master."*).
Under capitalism, Parsons stressed, *"those disinherited of their
natural rights must hire out and serve and obey the oppressing class or
starve. There is no other alternative. Some things are priceless, chief
among which are life and liberty. A freeman [or woman] is not for sale
or hire."* [**Anarchism**, p. 99 and p. 98] And why should we excuse
servitude or tolerate those who desire to restrict the liberty of
others? The "liberty" to command is the liberty to enslave, and so is
actually a denial of liberty.

Regarding the first objection, anarchists plead guilty. We **are**
prejudiced against the reduction of human beings to the status of
robots. We are prejudiced in favour of human dignity and freedom. We are
prejudiced, in fact, in favour of humanity and individuality.

([Section A.2.11](secA2.html#seca211) discusses why direct democracy is
the necessary social counterpart to voluntarism (i.e. free agreement).
[Section B.4](secB4.html) discusses why capitalism cannot be based on
equal bargaining power between property owners and the propertyless).

A.2.15 What about "human nature"?
---------------------------------

Anarchists, far from ignoring "human nature," have the only political
theory that gives this concept deep thought and reflection. Too often,
"human nature" is flung up as the last line of defence in an argument
against anarchism, because it is thought to be beyond reply. This is not
the case, however. First of all, human nature is a complex thing. If, by
human nature, it is meant "what humans do," it is obvious that human
nature is contradictory -- love and hate, compassion and heartlessness,
peace and violence, and so on, have all been expressed by people and so
are all products of "human nature." Of course, what is considered "human
nature" can change with changing social circumstances. For example,
slavery was considered part of "human nature" and "normal" for thousands
of years. Homosexuality was considered perfectly normal by the ancient
Greeks yet thousands of years later the Christian church denounced it as
unnatural. War only become part of "human nature" once states developed.
Hence Chomsky:

> "Individuals are certainly capable of evil . . . But individuals are
> capable of all sorts of things. Human nature has lots of ways of
> realising itself, humans have lots of capacities and options. Which
> ones reveal themselves depends to a large extent on the institutional
> structures. If we had institutions which permitted pathological
> killers free rein, they'd be running the place. The only way to
> survive would be to let those elements of your nature manifest
> themselves.
> "If we have institutions which make greed the sole property of human
> beings and encourage pure greed at the expense of other human emotions
> and commitments, we're going to have a society based on greed, with
> all that follows. A different society might be organised in such a way
> that human feelings and emotions of other sorts, say, solidarity,
> support, sympathy become dominant. Then you'll have different aspects
> of human nature and personality revealing themselves." [**Chronicles
> of Dissent**, pp. 158]

Therefore, environment plays an important part in defining what "human
nature" is, how it develops and what aspects of it are expressed.
Indeed, one of the greatest myths about anarchism is the idea that we
think human nature is inherently good (rather, we think it is inherently
sociable). How it develops and expresses itself is dependent on the kind
of society we live in and create. A hierarchical society will shape
people in certain (negative) ways and produce a "human nature" radically
different from a libertarian one. So *"when we hear men [and women]
saying that Anarchists imagine men [and women] much better than they
really are, we merely wonder how intelligent people can repeat that
nonsense. Do we not say continually that the only means of rendering men
[and women] less rapacious and egotistic, less ambitious and less
slavish at the same time, is to eliminate those conditions which favour
the growth of egotism and rapacity, of slavishness and ambition?"*
[Peter Kropotkin, **Act for Yourselves**, p. 83]

As such, the use of "human nature" as an argument against anarchism is
simply superficial and, ultimately, an evasion. It is an excuse not to
think. *"Every fool,"* as Emma Goldman put it, *"from king to policemen,
from the flatheaded parson to the visionless dabbler in science,
presumes to speak authoritatively of human nature. The greater the
mental charlatan, the more definite his insistence on the wickedness and
weakness of human nature. Yet how can any one speak of it to-day, with
every soul in prison, with every heart fettered, wounded, and maimed?"*
Change society, create a better social environment and then we can judge
what is a product of our natures and what is the product of an
authoritarian system. For this reason, anarchism *"stands for the
liberation of the human mind from the dominion of religion; the
liberation of the human body from the dominion of property; liberation
from the shackles and restraint of government."* For *"[f]reedom,
expansion, opportunity, and above all, peace and repose, alone can teach
us the real dominant factors of human nature and all its wonderful
possibilities."* [**Red Emma Speaks**, p. 73]

This does not mean that human beings are infinitely plastic, with each
individual born a **tabula rasa** (blank slate) waiting to be formed by
"society" (which in practice means those who run it). As Noam Chomsky
argues, *"I don't think its possible to give a rational account of the
concept of alienated labour on that assumption [that human nature is
nothing but a historical product], nor is it possible to produce
something like a moral justification for the commitment to some kind of
social change, except on the basis of assumptions about human nature and
how modifications in the structure of society will be better able to
conform to some of the fundamental needs that are part of our essential
nature."* [**Language and Politics**, p. 215] We do not wish to enter
the debate about what human characteristics are and are not "innate."
All we will say is that human beings have an innate ability to think and
learn -- that much is obvious, we feel -- and that humans are sociable
creatures, needing the company of others to feel complete and to
prosper. Moreover, they have the ability to recognise and oppose
injustice and oppression (Bakunin rightly considered *"**the power to
think** and **the desire to rebel**"* as *"precious faculties."* [**God
and the State**, p. 9]).

These three features, we think, suggest the viability of an anarchist
society. The innate ability to think for oneself automatically makes all
forms of hierarchy illegitimate, and our need for social relationships
implies that we can organise without the state. The deep unhappiness and
alienation afflicting modern society reveals that the centralisation and
authoritarianism of capitalism and the state are denying some innate
needs within us. In fact, as mentioned earlier, for the great majority
of its existence the human race **has** lived in anarchic communities,
with little or no hierarchy. That modern society calls such people
"savages" or "primitive" is pure arrogance. So who can tell whether
anarchism is against "human nature"? Anarchists have accumulated much
evidence to suggest that it may not be.

As for the charge the anarchists demand too much of "human nature," it
is often **non** anarchists who make the greatest claims on it. For
*"while our opponents seem to admit there is a kind of salt of the earth
-- the rulers, the employers, the leaders -- who, happily enough,
prevent those bad men -- the ruled, the exploited, the led -- from
becoming still worse than they are"* we anarchists *"maintain that
**both** rulers and ruled are spoiled by authority"* and *"**both**
exploiters and exploited are spoiled by exploitation."* So *"there is
[a] difference, and a very important one. **We** admit the imperfections
of human nature, but we make no exception for the rulers. **They** make
it, although sometimes unconsciously, and because we make no such
exception, they say that we are dreamers."* [Peter Kropotkin, **Op.
Cit.**, p. 83] If human nature is so bad, then giving some people power
over others and hoping this will lead to justice and freedom is
hopelessly utopian.

Moreover, as noted, Anarchists argue that hierarchical organisations
bring out the worse in human nature. Both the oppressor and the
oppressed are negatively affected by the authoritarian relationships so
produced. *"It is a characteristic of privilege and of every kind of
privilege,"* argued Bakunin, *"to kill the mind and heart of man . . .
That is a social law which admits no exceptions . . . It is the law of
equality and humanity."* [**God and the State**, p. 31] And while the
privileged become corrupted by power, the powerless (in general) become
servile in heart and mind (luckily the human spirit is such that there
will always be rebels no matter the oppression for where there is
oppression, there is resistance and, consequently, hope). As such, it
seems strange for anarchists to hear non-anarchists justify hierarchy in
terms of the (distorted) "human nature" it produces.

Sadly, too many have done precisely this. It continues to this day. For
example, with the rise of "sociobiology," some claim (with very little
**real** evidence) that capitalism is a product of our "nature," which
is determined by our genes. These claims are simply a new variation of
the "human nature" argument and have, unsurprisingly, been leapt upon by
the powers that be. Considering the dearth of evidence, their support
for this "new" doctrine must be purely the result of its utility to
those in power -- i.e. the fact that it is useful to have an "objective"
and "scientific" basis to rationalise inequalities in wealth and power
(for a discussion of this process see **Not in Our Genes: Biology,
Ideology and Human Nature** by Steven Rose, R.C. Lewontin and Leon J.
Kamin).

This is not to say that it does not hold a grain of truth. As scientist
Stephen Jay Gould notes, *"the range of our potential behaviour is
circumscribed by our biology"* and if this is what sociobiology means
*"by genetic control, then we can scarcely disagree."* However, this is
not what is meant. Rather, it is a form of *"biological determinism"*
that sociobiology argues for. Saying that there are specific genes for
specific human traits says little for while *"[v]iolence, sexism, and
general nastiness **are** biological since they represent one subset of
a possible range of behaviours"* so are *"peacefulness, equality, and
kindness."* And so *"we may see their influence increase if we can
create social structures that permit them to flourish."* That this may
be the case can be seen from the works of sociobiologists themselves,
who *"acknowledge diversity"* in human cultures while *"often
dismiss[ing] the uncomfortable 'exceptions' as temporary and unimportant
aberrations."* This is surprising, for if you believe that *"repeated,
often genocidal warfare has shaped our genetic destiny, the existence of
nonaggressive peoples is embarrassing."* [**Ever Since Darwin**, p. 252,
p. 257 and p. 254]

Like the social Darwinism that preceded it, sociobiology proceeds by
first projecting the dominant ideas of current society onto nature
(often unconsciously, so that scientists mistakenly consider the ideas
in question as both "normal" and "natural"). Bookchin refers to this as
*"the subtle projection of historically conditioned human values"* onto
nature rather than *"scientific objectivity."* Then the theories of
nature produced in this manner are transferred **back** onto society and
history, being used to "prove" that the principles of capitalism
(hierarchy, authority, competition, etc.) are eternal **laws,** which
are then appealed to as a justification for the status quo! *"What this
procedure does accomplish,"* notes Bookchin, *"is reinforce human social
hierarchies by justifying the command of men and women as innate
features of the 'natural order.' Human domination is thereby transcribed
into the genetic code as biologically immutable."* [**The Ecology of
Freedom**, p. 95 and p. 92] Amazingly, there are many supposedly
intelligent people who take this sleight-of-hand seriously.

This can be seen when "hierarchies" in nature are used to explain, and
so justify, hierarchies in human societies. Such analogies are
misleading for they forget the institutional nature of human life. As
Murray Bookchin notes in his critique of sociobiology, a *"weak,
enfeebled, unnerved, and sick ape is hardly likely to become an 'alpha'
male, much less retain this highly ephemeral 'status.' By contrast, the
most physically and mentally pathological human rulers have exercised
authority with devastating effect in the course of history."* This
*"expresses a power of hierarchical **institutions** over persons that
is completely reversed in so-called 'animal hierarchies' where the
absence of institutions is precisely the only intelligible way of
talking about 'alpha males' or 'queen bees.'"* [*"Sociobiology or Social
Ecology"*, **Which way for the Ecology Movement?**, p. 58] Thus what
makes human society unique is conveniently ignored and the real sources
of power in society are hidden under a genetic screen.

The sort of apologetics associated with appeals to "human nature" (or
sociobiology at its worse) are natural, of course, because every ruling
class needs to justify their right to rule. Hence they support doctrines
that defined the latter in ways appearing to justify elite power -- be
it sociobiology, divine right, original sin, etc. Obviously, such
doctrines have always been wrong . . . until now, of course, as it is
obvious our current society truly conforms to "human nature" and it has
been scientifically proven by our current scientific priesthood!

The arrogance of this claim is truly amazing. History hasn't stopped.
One thousand years from now, society will be completely different from
what it is presently or from what anyone has imagined. No government in
place at the moment will still be around, and the current economic
system will not exist. The only thing that may remain the same is that
people will still be claiming that their new society is the "One True
System" that completely conforms to human nature, even though all past
systems did not.

Of course, it does not cross the minds of supporters of capitalism that
people from different cultures may draw different conclusions from the
same facts -- conclusions that may be **more** valid. Nor does it occur
to capitalist apologists that the theories of the "objective" scientists
may be framed in the context of the dominant ideas of the society they
live in. It comes as no surprise to anarchists, however, that scientists
working in Tsarist Russia developed a theory of evolution based on
**cooperation** within species, quite unlike their counterparts in
capitalist Britain, who developed a theory based on **competitive
struggle** within and between species. That the latter theory reflected
the dominant political and economic theories of British society (notably
competitive individualism) is pure coincidence, of course.

Kropotkin's classic work **Mutual Aid**, for example, was written in
response to the obvious inaccuracies that British representatives of
Darwinism had projected onto nature and human life. Building upon the
mainstream Russian criticism of the British Darwinism of the time,
Kropotkin showed (with substantial empirical evidence) that "mutual aid"
within a group or species played as important a role as "mutual
struggle" between individuals within those groups or species (see
Stephan Jay Gould's essay *"Kropotkin was no Crackpot"* in his book
**Bully for Brontosaurus** for details and an evaluation). It was, he
stressed, a *"factor"* in evolution along with competition, a factor
which, in most circumstances, was far more important to survival. Thus
co-operation is just as "natural" as competition so proving that "human
nature" was not a barrier to anarchism as co-operation between members
of a species can be the best pathway to advantage individuals.

To conclude. Anarchists argue that anarchy is not against "human nature"
for two main reasons. Firstly, what is considered as being "human
nature" is shaped by the society we live in and the relationships we
create. This means a hierarchical society will encourage certain
personality traits to dominate while an anarchist one would encourage
others. As such, anarchists *"do not so much rely on the fact that human
nature will change as they do upon the theory that the same nature will
act differently under different circumstances."* Secondly, change
*"seems to be one of the fundamental laws of existence"* so *"who can
say that man [sic!] has reached the limits of his possibilities."*
[George Barrett, **Objections to Anarchism**, pp. 360-1 and p. 360]

For useful discussions on anarchist ideas on human nature, both of which
refute the idea that anarchists think human beings are naturally good,
see Peter Marshall's *"Human nature and anarchism"* [David Goodway
(ed.), **For Anarchism: History, Theory and Practice**, pp. 127-149] and
David Hartley's *"Communitarian Anarchism and Human Nature"*.
[**Anarchist Studies**, vol. 3, no. 2, Autumn 1995, pp. 145-164]

A.2.16 Does anarchism require "perfect" people to work?
-------------------------------------------------------

No. Anarchy is not a utopia, a "perfect" society. It will be a
***human*** society, with all the problems, hopes, and fears associated
with human beings. Anarchists do not think that human beings need to be
"perfect" for anarchy to work. They only need to be free. Thus Christie
and Meltzer:

> *"[A] common fallacy [is] that revolutionary socialism [i.e.
> anarchism] is an 'idealisation' of the workers and [so] the mere
> recital of their present faults is a refutation of the class struggle
> . . . it seems morally unreasonable that a free society . . . could
> exist without moral or ethical perfection. But so far as the overthrow
> of [existing] society is concerned, we may ignore the fact of people's
> shortcomings and prejudices, so long as they do not become

> they had acquired the social graces of the 'intellectual' or shed all
> the prejudices of the present society from family discipline to

> that once life can continue without imposed authority from above, and
> imposed authority cannot survive the withdrawal of labour from its
> service, the prejudices of authoritarianism will disappear. There is
> no cure for them other than the free process of education."* [**The
> Floodgates of Anarchy**, pp. 36-7]

Obviously, though, we think that a free society will produce people who
are more in tune with both their own and others individuality and needs,
thus reducing individual conflict. Remaining disputes would be solved by
reasonable methods, for example, the use of juries, mutual third
parties, or community and workplace assemblies (see [section
I.5.8](secI5.html#seci58) for a discussion of how could be done for
anti-social activities as well as disputes).

Like the "anarchism-is-against-human-nature" argument (see [section
A.2.15](secA2.html#seca215)), opponents of anarchism usually assume
"perfect" people -- people who are not corrupted by power when placed in
positions of authority, people who are strangely unaffected by the
distorting effects of hierarchy, privilege, and so forth. However,
anarchists make no such claims about human perfection. We simply
recognise that vesting power in the hands of one person or an elite is
never a good idea, as people are not perfect.

It should be noted that the idea that anarchism requires a "new"
(perfect) man or woman is often raised by the opponents of anarchism to
discredit it (and, usually, to justify the retention of hierarchical
authority, particularly capitalist relations of production). After all,
people are not perfect and are unlikely ever to be. As such, they pounce
on every example of a government falling and the resulting chaos to
dismiss anarchism as unrealistic. The media loves to proclaim a country
to be falling into "anarchy" whenever there is a disruption in "law and
order" and looting takes place.

Anarchists are not impressed by this argument. A moment's reflection
shows why, for the detractors make the basic mistake of assuming an
anarchist society without anarchists! (A variation of such claims is
raised by the right-wing "anarcho"-capitalists to discredit real
anarchism. However, their "objection" discredits their own claim to be
anarchists for they implicitly assume an anarchist society without
anarchists!). Needless to say, an "anarchy" made up of people who still
saw the need for authority, property and statism would soon become
authoritarian (i.e. non-anarchist) again. This is because even if the
government disappeared tomorrow, the same system would soon grow up
again, because *"the strength of the government rests not with itself,
but with the people. A great tyrant may be a fool, and not a superman.
His strength lies not in himself, but in the superstition of the people
who think that it is right to obey him. So long as that superstition
exists it is useless for some liberator to cut off the head of tyranny;
the people will create another, for they have grown accustomed to rely
on something outside themselves."* [George Barrett, **Objections to
Anarchism**, p. 355]

Hence Alexander Berkman:

> *"Our social institutions are founded on certain ideas; as long as the
> latter are generally believed, the institutions built on them are
> safe. Government remains strong because people think political
> authority and legal compulsion necessary. Capitalism will continue as
> long as such an economic system is considered adequate and just. The
> weakening of the ideas which support the evil and oppressive present
> day conditions means the ultimate breakdown of government and
> capitalism."* [**What is Anarchism?**, p. xii]

In other words, anarchy needs ***anarchists*** in order to be created
and survive. But these anarchists need not be perfect, just people who
have freed themselves, by their own efforts, of the superstition that
command-and-obedience relations and capitalist property rights are
necessary. The implicit assumption in the idea that anarchy needs
"perfect" people is that freedom will be given, not taken; hence the
obvious conclusion follows that an anarchy requiring "perfect" people
will fail. But this argument ignores the need for self-activity and
self-liberation in order to create a free society. For anarchists,
*"history is nothing but a struggle between the rulers and the ruled,
the oppressors and the oppressed."* [Peter Kropotkin, **Act for
Yourselves**, p. 85] Ideas change through struggle and, consequently, in
the struggle against oppression and exploitation, we not only change the
world, we change ourselves at the same time. So it is the struggle for
freedom which creates people capable of taking the responsibility for
their own lives, communities and planet. People capable of living as
equals in a free society, so making anarchy possible.

As such, the chaos which often results when a government disappears is
not anarchy nor, in fact, a case against anarchism. It simple means that
the necessary preconditions for creating an anarchist society do not
exist. Anarchy would be the product of collective struggle at the heart
of society, not the product of external shocks. Nor, we should note, do
anarchists think that such a society will appear "overnight." Rather, we
see the creation of an anarchist system as a process, not an event. The
ins-and-outs of how it would function will evolve over time in the light
of experience and objective circumstances, not appear in a perfect form
immediately (see [section H.2.5](secH2.html#sech25) for a discussion of
Marxist claims otherwise).

Therefore, anarchists do not conclude that "perfect" people are
necessary anarchism to work because the anarchist is *"no liberator with
a divine mission to free humanity, but he is a part of that humanity
struggling onwards towards liberty."* As such, *"[i]f, then, by some
external means an Anarchist Revolution could be, so to speak, supplied
ready-made and thrust upon the people, it is true that they would reject
it and rebuild the old society. If, on the other hand, the people
develop their ideas of freedom, and they themselves get rid of the last
stronghold of tyranny --- the government -- then indeed the revolution
will be permanently accomplished."* [George Barrett, **Op. Cit.**, p.
355]

This is not to suggest that an anarchist society must wait until
***everyone*** is an anarchist. Far from it. It is highly unlikely, for
example, that the rich and powerful will suddenly see the errors of
their ways and voluntarily renounce their privileges. Faced with a large
and growing anarchist movement, the ruling elite has always used
repression to defend its position in society. The use of fascism in
Spain (see [section A.5.6](secA5.html#seca56)) and Italy (see [section
A.5.5](secA5.html#seca55)) show the depths the capitalist class can sink
to. Anarchism will be created in the face of opposition by the ruling
minorities and, consequently, will need to defend itself against
attempts to recreate authority (see [section H.2.1](secH2.html#sech21)
for a refutation of Marxist claims anarchists reject the need to defend
an anarchist society against counter-revolution).

Instead anarchists argue that we should focus our activity on convincing
those subject to oppression and exploitation that they have the power to
resist both and, ultimately, can end both by destroying the social
institutions that cause them. As Malatesta argued, *"we need the support
of the masses to build a force of sufficient strength to achieve our
specific task of radical change in the social organism by the direct
action of the masses, we must get closer to them, accept them as they
are, and from within their ranks seek to 'push' them forward as much as
possible."* [**Errico Malatesta: His Life and Ideas**, pp. 155-6] This
would create the conditions that make possible a rapid evolution towards
anarchism as what was initially accepted by a minority *"but
increasingly finding popular expression, will make its way among the
mass of the people"* and *"the minority will become the People, the
great mass, and that mass rising up against property and the State, will
march forward towards anarchist communism."* [Kropotkin, **Words of a
Rebel**, p. 75] Hence the importance anarchists attach to spreading our
ideas and arguing the case for anarchism. This creates conscious
anarchists from those questioning the injustices of capitalism and the
state.

This process is helped by the nature of hierarchical society and the
resistance it naturally developed in those subject to it. Anarchist
ideas develop spontaneously through struggle. As we discuss in [section
I.2.3](secI2.html#seci23), anarchistic organisations are often created
as part of the resistance against oppression and exploitation which
marks every hierarchical system and can., potentially, be the framework
of a few society. As such, the creation of libertarian institutions is,
therefore, always a possibility in any situation. A peoples' experiences
may push them towards anarchist conclusions, namely the awareness that
the state exists to protect the wealthy and powerful few and to
disempower the many. That while it is needed to maintain class and
hierarchical society, it is not needed to organise society nor can it do
so in a just and fair way for all. This is possible. However, without a
conscious anarchist presence any libertarian tendencies are likely to be
used, abused and finally destroyed by parties or religious groups
seeking political power over the masses (the Russian Revolution is the
most famous example of this process). It is for that reason anarchists
organise to influence the struggle and spread our ideas (see [section
J.3](secJ3.html) for details). For it is the case that only when
anarchist ideas *"acquire a predominating influence"* and are *"accepted
by a sufficiently large section of the population"* will we *"have
achieved anarchy, or taken a step towards anarchy."* For anarchy
*"cannot be imposed against the wishes of the people."* [Malatesta,
**Op. Cit.**, p. 159 and p. 163]

So, to conclude, the creation of an anarchist society is not dependent
on people being perfect but it is dependent on a large majority being
anarchists and wanting to reorganise society in a libertarian manner.
This will not eliminate conflict between individuals nor create a fully
formed anarchist humanity overnight but it will lay the ground for the
gradual elimination of whatever prejudices and anti-social behaviour
that remain after the struggle to change society has revolutionised
those doing it.

A.2.17 Aren't most people too stupid for a free society to work?
----------------------------------------------------------------

We are sorry to have to include this question in an anarchist FAQ, but
we know that many political ideologies explicitly assume that ordinary
people are too stupid to be able to manage their own lives and run
society. All aspects of the capitalist political agenda, from Left to
Right, contain people who make this claim. Be it Leninists, fascists,
Fabians or Objectivists, it is assumed that only a select few are
creative and intelligent and that these people should govern others.
Usually, this elitism is masked by fine, flowing rhetoric about
"freedom," "democracy" and other platitudes with which the ideologues
attempt to dull people's critical thought by telling them want they want
to hear.

It is, of course, also no surprise that those who believe in "natural"
elites always class themselves at the top. We have yet to discover an
"objectivist", for example, who considers themselves part of the great
mass of "second-handers" (it is always amusing to hear people who simply
parrot the ideas of Ayn Rand dismissing other people so!) or who will be
a toilet cleaner in the unknown "ideal" of "real" capitalism. Everybody
reading an elitist text will consider him or herself to be part of the
"select few." It's "natural" in an elitist society to consider elites to
be natural and yourself a potential member of one!

Examination of history shows that there is a basic elitist ideology
which has been the essential rationalisation of all states and ruling
classes since their emergence at the beginning of the Bronze Age (*"if
the legacy of domination had had any broader purpose than the support of
hierarchical and class interests, it has been the attemp to exorcise the
belief in public competence from social discourse itself."* [Bookchin,
**The Ecology of Freedom**, p. 206]). This ideology merely changes its
outer garments, not its basic inner content over time.

During the Dark Ages, for example, it was coloured by Christianity,
being adapted to the needs of the Church hierarchy. The most useful
"divinely revealed" dogma to the priestly elite was "original sin": the
notion that human beings are basically depraved and incompetent
creatures who need "direction from above," with priests as the
conveniently necessary mediators between ordinary humans and "God." The
idea that average people are basically stupid and thus incapable of
governing themselves is a carry over from this doctrine, a relic of the
Dark Ages.

In reply to all those who claim that most people are "second-handers" or
cannot develop anything more than "trade union consciousness," all we
can say is that it is an absurdity that cannot withstand even a
superficial look at history, particularly the labour movement. The
creative powers of those struggling for freedom is often truly amazing,
and if this intellectual power and inspiration is not seen in "normal"
society, this is the clearest indictment possible of the deadening
effects of hierarchy and the conformity produced by authority. (See also
[section B.1](secB1.html) for more on the effects of hierarchy). As Bob
Black points outs:

> *"You are what you do. If you do boring, stupid, monotonous work,
> chances are you'll end up boring, stupid, and monotonous. Work is a
> much better explanation for the creeping cretinisation all around us
> than even such significant moronising mechanisms as television and
> education. People who are regimented all their lives, handed to work

> the vitality from people at work, they'll likely submit to hierarchy
> and expertise in everything. They're used to it."*[**The Abolition of
> Work and other essays**, pp. 21-2]

When elitists try to conceive of liberation, they can only think of it
being **given** to the oppressed by kind (for Leninists) or stupid (for
Objectivists) elites. It is hardly surprising, then, that it fails. Only
self-liberation can produce a free society. The crushing and distorting
effects of authority can only be overcome by self-activity. The few
examples of such self-liberation prove that most people, once considered
incapable of freedom by others, are more than up for the task.

Those who proclaim their "superiority" often do so out of fear that
their authority and power will be destroyed once people free themselves
from the debilitating hands of authority and come to realise that, in
the words of Max Stirner, *"the great are great only because we are on
our knees. Let us rise"*

As Emma Goldman remarks about women's equality, *"[t]he extraordinary
achievements of women in every walk of life have silenced forever the
loose talk of women's inferiority. Those who still cling to this fetish
do so because they hate nothing so much as to see their authority
challenged. This is the characteristic of all authority, whether the
master over his economic slaves or man over women. However, everywhere
woman is escaping her cage, everywhere she is going ahead with free,
large strides."* [**Vision on Fire**, p. 256] The same comments are
applicable, for example, to the very successful experiments in workers'
self-management during the Spanish Revolution.

Then, of course, the notion that people are too stupid for anarchism to
work also backfires on those who argue it. Take, for example, those who
use this argument to advocate democratic government rather than anarchy.
Democracy, as Luigi Galleani noted, means *"acknowledging the right and
the competence of the people to select their rulers."* However,
*"whoever has the political competence to choose his [or her] own rulers
is, by implication, also competent to do without them, especially when
the causes of economic enmity are uprooted."* [**The End of
Anarchism?**, p. 37] Thus the argument for democracy against anarchism
undermines itself, for *"if you consider these worthy electors as unable
to look after their own interests themselves, how is it that they know
how to choose for themselves the shepherds who must guide them? And how
will they be able to solve this problem of social alchemy, of producing
the election of a genius from the votes of a mass of fools?"*
[Malatesta, **Anarchy**, pp. 53-4]

As for those who consider dictatorship as the solution to human
stupidity, the question arises why are these dictators immune to this
apparently universal human trait? And, as Malatesta noted, *"who are the
best? And who will recognise these qualities in them?"* [**Op. Cit.**,
p. 53] If they impose themselves on the "stupid" masses, why assume they
will not exploit and oppress the many for their own benefit? Or, for
that matter, that they are any more intelligent than the masses? The
history of dictatorial and monarchical government suggests a clear
answer to those questions. A similar argument applies for other
non-democratic systems, such as those based on limited suffrage. For
example, the Lockean (i.e. classical liberal or right-wing libertarian)
ideal of a state based on the rule of property owners is doomed to be
little more than a regime which oppresses the majority to maintain the
power and privilege of the wealthy few. Equally, the idea of near
universal stupidity bar an elite of capitalists (the "objectivist"
vision) implies a system somewhat less ideal than the perfect system
presented in the literature. This is because most people would tolerate
oppressive bosses who treat them as means to an end rather than an end
in themselves. For how can you expect people to recognise and pursue
their own self-interest if you consider them fundamentally as the
*"uncivilised hordes"*? You cannot have it both ways and the *"unknown
ideal"* of pure capitalism would be as grubby, oppressive and alienating
as "actually existing" capitalism.

As such, anarchists are firmly convinced that arguments against anarchy
based on the lack of ability of the mass of people are inherently
self-contradictory (when not blatantly self-servicing). If people are
too stupid for anarchism then they are too stupid for any system you
care to mention. Ultimately, anarchists argue that such a perspective
simply reflects the servile mentality produced by a hierarchical society
rather than a genuine analysis of humanity and our history as a species.
To quote Rousseau:

> *"when I see multitudes of entirely naked savages scorn European
> voluptuousness and endure hunger, fire, the sword, and death to
> preserve only their independence, I feel that it does not behove
> slaves to reason about freedom."* [quoted by Noam Chomsky, **Marxism,
> Anarchism, and Alternative Futures**, p. 780]

A.2.18 Do anarchists support terrorism?
---------------------------------------

No. This is for three reasons.

Terrorism means either targeting or not worrying about killing innocent
people. For anarchy to exist, it must be created by the mass of people.
One does not convince people of one's ideas by blowing them up.
Secondly, anarchism is about self-liberation. One cannot blow up a
social relationship. Freedom cannot be created by the actions of an
elite few destroying rulers **on behalf of** the majority. Simply put, a
*"structure based on centuries of history cannot be destroyed with a few
kilos of explosives."* [Kropotkin, quoted by Martin A. Millar,
**Kropotkin**, p. 174] For so long as people feel the need for rulers,
hierarchy will exist (see [section A.2.16](secA2.html#seca216) for more
on this). As we have stressed earlier, freedom cannot be given, only
taken. Lastly, anarchism aims for freedom. Hence Bakunin's comment that
*"when one is carrying out a revolution for the liberation of humanity,
one should respect the life and liberty of men [and women]."* [quoted by
K.J. Kenafick, **Michael Bakunin and Karl Marx**, p. 125] For
anarchists, means determine the ends and terrorism by its very nature
violates life and liberty of individuals and so cannot be used to create
an anarchist society. The history of, say, the Russian Revolution,
confirmed Kropotkin's insight that *"[v]ery sad would be the future
revolution if it could only triumph by terror."* [quoted by Millar,
**Op. Cit.**, p. 175]

Moreover anarchists are **not** against individuals but the institutions
and social relationships that cause certain individuals to have power
over others and abuse (i.e. use) that power. Therefore the anarchist
revolution is about destroying structures, not people. As Bakunin
pointed out, *"we wish not to kill persons, but to abolish status and
its perquisites"* and anarchism *"does not mean the death of the
individuals who make up the bourgeoisie, but the death of the
bourgeoisie as a political and social entity economically distinct from
the working class."* [**The Basic Bakunin**, p. 71 and p. 70] In other
words, ***"You can't blow up a social relationship"*** (to quote the
title of an anarchist pamphlet which presents the anarchist case against
terrorism).

How is it, then, that anarchism is associated with violence? Partly this
is because the state and media insist on referring to terrorists who are
**not** anarchists as anarchists. For example, the German
Baader-Meinhoff gang were often called "anarchists" despite their
self-proclaimed Marxist-Leninism. Smears, unfortunately, work.
Similarly, as Emma Goldman pointed out, *"it is a known fact known to
almost everyone familiar with the Anarchist movement that a great number
of [violent] acts, for which Anarchists had to suffer, either originated
with the capitalist press or were instigated, if not directly
perpetrated, by the police."* [**Red Emma Speaks**, p. 262]

An example of this process at work can be seen from the current
anti-globalisation movement. In Seattle, for example, the media reported
"violence" by protestors (particularly anarchist ones) yet this amounted
to a few broken windows. The much greater **actual** violence of the
police against protestors (which, incidentally, started **before** the
breaking of a single window) was not considered worthy of comment.
Subsequent media coverage of anti-globalisation demonstrations followed
this pattern, firmly connecting anarchism with violence in spite of that
the protesters have been the ones to suffer the greatest violence at the
hands of the state. As anarchist activist Starhawk notes, *"if breaking
windows and fighting back when the cops attack is 'violence,' then give
me a new word, a word a thousand times stronger, to use when the cops
are beating non-resisting people into comas."* [**Staying on the
Streets**, p. 130]

Similarly, at the Genoa protests in 2001 the mainstream media presented
the protestors as violent even though it was the state who killed one of
them and hospitalised many thousands more. The presence of police agent
provocateurs in creating the violence was unmentioned by the media. As
Starhawk noted afterwards, in Genoa *"we encountered a carefully
orchestrated political campaign of state terrorism. The campaign
included disinformation, the use of infiltrators and provocateurs,
collusion with avowed Fascist groups . . . , the deliberate targeting of
non-violent groups for tear gas and beating, endemic police brutality,
the torture of prisoners, the political persecution of organisers . . .
They did all those openly, in a way that indicates they had no fear of
repercussions and expected political protection from the highest
sources."* [**Op. Cit.**, pp. 128-9] This was, unsurprisingly, not
reported by the media.

Subsequent protests have seen the media indulge in yet more
anti-anarchist hype, inventing stories to present anarchists are
hate-filled individuals planning mass violence. For example, in Ireland
in 2004 the media reported that anarchists were planning to use poison
gas during EU related celebrations in Dublin. Of course, evidence of
such a plan was not forthcoming and no such action happened. Neither did
the riot the media said anarchists were organising. A similar process of
misinformation accompanied the anti-capitalist May Day demonstrations in
London and the protests against the Republican National Congress in New
York. In spite of being constantly proved wrong after the event, the
media always prints the scare stories of anarchist violence (even
inventing events at, say Seattle, to justify their articles and to
demonise anarchism further). Thus the myth that anarchism equals
violence is perpetrated. Needless to say, the same papers that hyped the
(non-existent) threat of anarchist violence remained silent on the
actual violence of, and repression by, the police against demonstrators
which occurred at these events. Neither did they run apologies after
their (evidence-less) stories of doom were exposed as the nonsense they
were by subsequent events.

This does not mean that Anarchists have not committed acts of violence.
They have (as have members of other political and religious movements).
The main reason for the association of terrorism with anarchism is
because of the ***"propaganda by the deed"*** period in the anarchist
movement.

This period -- roughly from 1880 to 1900 -- was marked by a small number
of anarchists assassinating members of the ruling class (royalty,
politicians and so forth). At its worse, this period saw theatres and
shops frequented by members of the bourgeoisie targeted. These acts were
termed *"propaganda by the deed."* Anarchist support for the tactic was
galvanised by the assassination of Tsar Alexander II in 1881 by Russian
Populists (this event prompted Johann Most's famous editorial in
**Freiheit**, entitled *"At Last!"*, celebrating regicide and the
assassination of tyrants). However, there were deeper reasons for
anarchist support of this tactic: firstly, in revenge for acts of
repression directed towards working class people; and secondly, as a
means to encourage people to revolt by showing that their oppressors
could be defeated.

Considering these reasons it is no coincidence that propaganda by the
deed began in France after the 20 000-plus deaths due to the French
state's brutal suppression of the Paris Commune, in which many
anarchists were killed. It is interesting to note that while the
anarchist violence in revenge for the Commune is relatively well known,
the state's mass murder of the Communards is relatively unknown.
Similarly, it may be known that the Italian Anarchist Gaetano Bresci
assassinated King Umberto of Italy in 1900 or that Alexander Berkman
tried to kill Carnegie Steel Corporation manager Henry Clay Frick in
1892. What is often unknown is that Umberto's troops had fired upon and
killed protesting peasants or that Frick's Pinkertons had also murdered
locked-out workers at Homestead.

Such downplaying of statist and capitalist violence is hardly
surprising. *"The State's behaviour is violence,"* points out Max
Stirner, *"and it calls its violence 'law'; that of the individual,
'crime.'"* [**The Ego and Its Own**, p. 197] Little wonder, then, that
anarchist violence is condemned but the repression (and often worse
violence) that provoked it ignored and forgotten. Anarchists point to
the hypocrisy of the accusation that anarchists are "violent" given that
such claims come from either supporters of government or the actual
governments themselves, governments *"which came into being through
violence, which maintain themselves in power through violence, and which
use violence constantly to keep down rebellion and to bully other
nations."* [Howard Zinn, **The Zinn Reader**, p. 652]

We can get a feel of the hypocrisy surrounding condemnation of anarchist
violence by non-anarchists by considering their response to state
violence. For example, many capitalist papers and individuals in the
1920s and 1930s celebrated Fascism as well as Mussolini and Hitler.
Anarchists, in contrast, fought Fascism to the death and tried to
assassinate both Mussolini and Hitler. Obviously supporting murderous
dictatorships is not "violence" and "terrorism" but resisting such
regimes is! Similarly, non-anarchists can support repressive and
authoritarian states, war and the suppression of strikes and unrest by
violence ("restoring law and order") and not be considered "violent."
Anarchists, in contrast, are condemned as "violent" and "terrorist"
because a few of them tried to revenge such acts of oppression and
state/capitalist violence! Similarly, it seems the height of hypocrisy
for someone to denounce the anarchist "violence" which produces a few
broken windows in, say, Seattle while supporting the actual violence of
the police in imposing the state's rule or, even worse, supporting the
American invasion of Iraq in 2003. If anyone should be considered
violent it is the supporter of state and its actions yet people do not
see the obvious and *"deplore the type of violence that the state
deplores, and applaud the violence that the state practises."* [Christie
and Meltzer, **The Floodgates of Anarchy**, p. 132]

It must be noted that the majority of anarchists did not support this
tactic. Of those who committed "propaganda by the deed" (sometimes
called *"attentats"*), as Murray Bookchin points out, only a *"few . . .
were members of Anarchist groups. The majority . . . were soloists."*
[**The Spanish Anarchists**, p. 102] Needless to say, the state and
media painted all anarchists with the same brush. They still do, usually
inaccurately (such as blaming Bakunin for such acts even though he had
been dead years before the tactic was even discussed in anarchist
circles or by labelling non-anarchist groups anarchists!).

All in all, the "propaganda by the deed" phase of anarchism was a
failure, as the vast majority of anarchists soon came to see. Kropotkin
can be considered typical. He *"never liked the slogan **propaganda by
deed**, and did not use it to describe his own ideas of revolutionary
action."* However, in 1879 while still *"urg[ing] the importance of
collective action"* he started *"expressing considerable sympathy and
interest in **attentats**"* (these *"collective forms of action"* were
seen as acting *"at the trade union and communal level"*). In 1880 he
*"became less preoccupied with collective action and this enthusiasm for
acts of revolt by individuals and small groups increased."* This did not
last and Kropotkin soon attached *"progressively less importance to
isolated acts of revolt"* particularly once *"he saw greater
opportunities for developing collective action in the new militant trade
unionism."* [Caroline Cahm, **Kropotkin and the Rise of Revolutionary
Anarchism**, p. 92, p. 115, p. 129, pp. 129-30, p. 205] By the late
1880s and early 1890s he came to disapprove of such acts of violence.
This was partly due to simple revulsion at the worse of the acts (such
as the Barcelona Theatre bombing in response to the state murder of
anarchists involved in the Jerez uprising of 1892 and Emile Henry's
bombing of a cafe in response to state repression) and partly due to the
awareness that it was hindering the anarchist cause.

Kropotkin recognised that the *"spate of terrorist acts"* of the 1880s
had caused *"the authorities into taking repressive action against the
movement"* and were *"not in his view consistent with the anarchist
ideal and did little or nothing to promote popular revolt."* In
addition, he was *"anxious about the isolation of the movement from the
masses"* which *"had increased rather than diminished as a result of the
preoccupation with"* propaganda by deed. He *"saw the best possibility
for popular revolution in the . . . development of the new militancy in
the labour movement. From now on he focussed his attention increasingly
on the importance of revolutionary minorities working among the masses
to develop the spirit of revolt."* However, even during the early 1880s
when his support for individual acts of revolt (if not for propaganda by
the deed) was highest, he saw the need for collective class struggle
and, therefore, *"Kropotkin always insisted on the importance of the
labour movement in the struggles leading up to the revolution."* [**Op.
Cit.**, pp. 205-6, p. 208 and p. 280]

Kropotkin was not alone. More and more anarchists came to see
"propaganda by the deed" as giving the state an excuse to clamp down on
both the anarchist and labour movements. Moreover, it gave the media
(and opponents of anarchism) a chance to associate anarchism with
mindless violence, thus alienating much of the population from the
movement. This false association is renewed at every opportunity,
regardless of the facts (for example, even though Individualist
Anarchists rejected "propaganda by the deed" totally, they were also
smeared by the press as "violent" and "terrorists").

In addition, as Kropotkin pointed out, the assumption behind propaganda
by the deed, i.e. that everyone was waiting for a chance to rebel, was
false. In fact, people are products of the system in which they live;
hence they accepted most of the myths used to keep that system going.
With the failure of propaganda by deed, anarchists turned back to what
most of the movement had been doing anyway: encouraging the class
struggle and the process of self-liberation. This turn back to the roots
of anarchism can be seen from the rise in anarcho-syndicalist unions
after 1890 (see [section A.5.3](secA2.html#seca53)). This position flows
naturally from anarchist theory, unlike the idea of individual acts of
violence:

> *"to bring about a revolution, and specially the Anarchist
> revolution[, it] is necessary that the people be conscious of their
> rights and their strength; it is necessary that they be ready to fight
> and ready to take the conduct of their affairs into their own hands.

> [Errico Malatesta, *"The Duties of the Present Hour"*, pp. 181-3,
> **Anarchism**, Robert Graham (ed.), pp. 180-1]

Despite most anarchists' tactical disagreement with propaganda by deed,
few would consider it to be terrorism or rule out assassination under
all circumstances. Bombing a village during a war because there
**might** be an enemy in it is terrorism, whereas assassinating a
murdering dictator or head of a repressive state is defence at best and
revenge at worst. As anarchists have long pointed out, if by terrorism
it is meant "killing innocent people" then the state is the greatest
terrorist of them all (as well as having the biggest bombs and other
weapons of destruction available on the planet). If the people
committing "acts of terror" are really anarchists, they would do
everything possible to avoid harming innocent people and never use the
statist line that "collateral damage" is regrettable but inevitable.
This is why the vast majority of "propaganda by the deed" acts were
directed towards individuals of the ruling class, such as Presidents and
Royalty, and were the result of previous acts of state and capitalist
violence.

So "terrorist" acts have been committed by anarchists. This is a fact.
However, it has nothing to do with anarchism as a socio-political
theory. As Emma Goldman argued, it was *"not Anarchism, as such, but the
brutal slaughter of the eleven steel workers [that] was the urge for
Alexander Berkman's act."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 268] Equally, members of
**other** political and religious groups have also committed such acts.
As the Freedom Group of London argued:

> *"There is a truism that the man [or woman] in the street seems always
> to forget, when he is abusing the Anarchists, or whatever party
> happens to be his **bete noire** for the moment, as the cause of some
> outrage just perpetrated. This indisputable fact is that homicidal

> Such acts are the violent recoil from violence, whether aggressive or

> in the depths of . . . human nature itself. The whole course of
> history, political and social, is strewn with evidence of this."*
> [quoted by Emma Goldman, **Op. Cit.**, p. 259]

Terrorism has been used by many other political, social and religious
groups and parties. For example, Christians, Marxists, Hindus,
Nationalists, Republicans, Moslems, Sikhs, Fascists, Jews and Patriots
have all committed acts of terrorism. Few of these movements or ideas
have been labelled as "terrorist by nature" or continually associated
with violence -- which shows anarchism's threat to the status quo. There
is nothing more likely to discredit and marginalise an idea than for
malicious and/or ill-informed persons to portray those who believe and
practice it as "mad bombers" with no opinions or ideals at all, just an
insane urge to destroy.

Of course, the vast majority of Christians and so on have opposed
terrorism as morally repugnant and counter-productive. As have the vast
majority of anarchists, at all times and places. However, it seems that
in our case it is necessary to state our opposition to terrorism time
and time again.

So, to summarise - only a small minority of terrorists have ever been
anarchists, and only a small minority of anarchists have ever been
terrorists. The anarchist movement as a whole has always recognised that
social relationships cannot be assassinated or bombed out of existence.
Compared to the violence of the state and capitalism, anarchist violence
is a drop in the ocean. Unfortunately most people remember the acts of
the few anarchists who have committed violence rather than the acts of
violence and repression by the state and capital that prompted those
acts.

A.2.19 What ethical views do anarchists hold?
---------------------------------------------

Anarchist viewpoints on ethics vary considerably, although all share a
common belief in the need for an individual to develop within themselves
their own sense of ethics. All anarchists agree with Max Stirner that an
individual must free themselves from the confines of existing morality
and question that morality -- *"I decide whether it is the **right
thing** for me; there is no right **outside** me."* [**The Ego and Its
Own**, p. 189]

Few anarchists, however, would go so far as Stirner and reject **any**
concept of social ethics at all (saying that, Stirner does value some
universal concepts although they are egoistic ones). Such extreme moral
relativism is almost as bad as moral absolutism for most anarchists
(moral relativism is the view that there is no right or wrong beyond
what suits an individual while moral absolutism is that view that what
is right and wrong is independent of what individuals think).

It is often claimed that modern society is breaking up because of
excessive "egoism" or moral relativism. This is false. As far as moral
relativism goes, this is a step forward from the moral absolutism urged
upon society by various Moralists and true-believers because it bases
itself, however slimly, upon the idea of individual reason. However, as
it denies the existence (or desirability) of ethics it is but the mirror
image of what it is rebelling against. Neither option empowers the
individual or is liberating.

Consequently, both of these attitudes hold enormous attraction to
authoritarians, as a populace that is either unable to form an opinion
about things (and will tolerate anything) or who blindly follow the
commands of the ruling elite are of great value to those in power. Both
are rejected by most anarchists in favour of an evolutionary approach to
ethics based upon human reason to develop the ethical concepts and
interpersonal empathy to generalise these concepts into ethical
attitudes within society as well as within individuals. An anarchistic
approach to ethics therefore shares the critical individual
investigation implied in moral relativism but grounds itself into common
feelings of right and wrong. As Proudhon argued:

> *"All progress begins by abolishing something; every reform rests upon
> denunciation of some abuse; each new idea is based upon the proved
> insufficiency of the old idea."*

Most anarchists take the viewpoint that ethical standards, like life
itself, are in a constant process of evolution. This leads them to
reject the various notions of *"God's Law,"* *"Natural Law,"* and so on
in favour of a theory of ethical development based upon the idea that
individuals are entirely empowered to question and assess the world
around them -- in fact, they require it in order to be truly free. You
cannot be an anarchist and blindly accept **anything**! Michael Bakunin,
one of the founding anarchist thinkers, expressed this radical
scepticism as so:

> *"No theory, no ready-made system, no book that has ever been written
> will save the world. I cleave to no system. I am a true seeker."*

Any system of ethics which is not based on individual questioning can
only be authoritarian. Erich Fromm explains why:

> *"Formally, authoritarian ethics denies man's capacity to know what is
> good or bad; the norm giver is always an authority transcending the
> individual. Such a system is based not on reason and knowledge but on
> awe of the authority and on the subject's feeling of weakness and
> dependence; the surrender of decision making to the authority results
> from the latter's magic power; its decisions can not and must not be
> questioned. **Materially**, or according to content, authoritarian
> ethics answers the question of what is good or bad primarily in terms
> of the interests of the authority, not the interests of the subject;
> it is exploitative, although the subject may derive considerable
> benefits, psychic or material, from it."* [**Man For Himself**, p. 10]

Therefore Anarchists take, essentially, a scientific approach to
problems. Anarchists arrive at ethical judgements without relying on the
mythology of spiritual aid, but on the merits of their own minds. This
is done through logic and reason, and is a far better route to resolving
moral questions than obsolete, authoritarian systems like orthodox
religion and certainly better than the "there is no wrong or right" of
moral relativism.

So, what are the source of ethical concepts? For Kropotkin, *"nature has
thus to be recognised as the **first ethical teacher of man.** The
social instinct, innate in men as well as in all the social animals, -
this is the origin of all ethical conceptions and all subsequent
development of morality."* [**Ethics**, p. 45]

Life, in other words, is the basis of anarchist ethics. This means that,
essentially (according to anarchists), an individual's ethical
viewpoints are derived from three basic sources:

> ​1) from the society an individual lives in. As Kropotkin pointed out,
> *"Man's conceptions of morality are completely dependent upon the form
> that their social life assumed at a given time in a given locality . .
> . this [social life] is reflected in the moral conceptions of men and
> in the moral teachings of the given epoch."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 315] In
> other words, experience of life and of living.
>
> ​2) A critical evaluation by individuals of their society's ethical
> norms, as indicated above. This is the core of Erich Fromm's argument
> that *"Man must accept the responsibility for himself and the fact
> that only using his own powers can he give meaning to his life . .
> .**there is no meaning to life except the meaning man gives his life
> by the unfolding of his powers, by living productively.**"* [**Man for
> Himself**, p. 45] In other words, individual thought and development.
>
> ​3) The feeling of empathy - *"the true origin of the moral sentiment
> . . . [is] simply in the feeling of sympathy."* [*"Anarchist
> Morality"*, **Anarchism**, p. 94] In other words, an individual's
> ability to feel and share experiences and concepts with others.

This last factor is very important for the development of a sense of
ethics. As Kropotkin argued, *"[t]he more powerful your imagination, the
better you can picture to yourself what any being feels when it is made
to suffer, and the more intense and delicate will your moral sense be. .
. And the more you are accustomed by circumstances, by those surrounding
you, or by the intensity of your own thought and your imagination, to
**act** as your own thought and imagination urge, the more will the
moral sentiment grow in you, the more will it became habitual."* [**Op.
Cit.**, p. 95]

So, anarchism is based (essentially) upon the ethical maxim *"treat
others as you would like them to treat you under similar
circumstances."* Anarchists are neither egoists nor altruists when it
come to moral stands, they are simply **human.**

As Kropotkin noted, *"egoism"* and *"altruism"* both have their roots in
the same motive -- *"however great the difference between the two
actions in their result of humanity, the motive is the same. It is the
quest for pleasure."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 85]

For anarchists, a person's sense of ethics must be developed by
themselves and requires the full use of an individual's mental abilities
as part of a social grouping, as part of a community. As capitalism and
other forms of authority weaken the individual's imagination and reduce
the number of outlets for them to exercise their reason under the dead
weight of hierarchy as well as disrupting community, little wonder that
life under capitalism is marked by a stark disregard for others and lack
of ethical behaviour.

Combined with these factors is the role played by inequality within
society. Without equality, there can be no real ethics for *"Justice
implies Equality. . . only those who consider **others** as their
**equals** can obey the rule: 'Do not do to others what you do not wish
them to do to you.' A serf-owner and a slave merchant can evidently not
recognise . . . the 'categorial imperative' [of treating people as ends
in themselves and not as means] as regards serfs [or slaves] because
they do not look upon them as equals."* Hence the *"greatest obstacle to
the maintenance of a certain moral level in our present societies lies
in the absence of social equality. Without **real** equality, the sense
of justice can never be universally developed, because **Justice implies
the recognition of Equality.**"* [Peter Kropotkin, **Evolution and
Environment**, p. 88 and p. 79]

Capitalism, like any society, gets the ethical behaviour it deserves..

In a society which moves between moral relativism and absolutism it is
little wonder that egoism becomes confused with egotism. By
disempowering individuals from developing their own ethical ideas and
instead encouraging blind obedience to external authority (and so moral
relativism once individuals think that they are without that authority's
power), capitalist society ensures an impoverishment of individuality
and ego. As Erich Fromm puts it:

> *"The failure of modern culture lies not in its principle of
> individualism, not in the idea that moral virtue is the same as the
> pursuit of self-interest, but in the deterioration of the meaning of
> self-interest; not in the fact that people are **too much concerned
> with their self-interest,** but that they are **not concerned enough
> with the interest of their real self; not in the fact that they are
> too selfish, but that they do not love themselves.**"* [**Man for
> Himself**, p. 139]

Therefore, strictly speaking, anarchism is based upon an egoistic frame
of reference - ethical ideas must be an expression of what gives us
pleasure as a whole individual (both rational and emotional, reason and
empathy). This leads all anarchists to reject the false division between
egoism and altruism and recognise that what many people (for example,
capitalists) call "egoism" results in individual self-negation and a
reduction of individual self-interest. As Kropotkin argues:

> *"What was it that morality, evolving in animal and human societies,
> was striving for, if not for the opposition to the promptings of
> narrow egoism, and bringing up humanity in the spirit of the
> development of altruism? The very expressions 'egoism' and 'altruism'
> are incorrect, because there can be no pure altruism without an
> admixture of personal pleasure - and consequently, without egoism. It
> would therefore be more nearly correct to say that ethics aims at
> **the development of social habits and the weakening of the narrowly
> personal habits.** These last make the individual lose sight of
> society through his regard for his own person, and therefore they even
> fail to attain their object, i.e. the welfare of the individual,
> whereas the development of habits of work in common, and of mutual aid
> in general, leads to a series of beneficial consequences in the family
> as well as society."* [**Ethics**, pp. 307-8]

Therefore anarchism is based upon the rejection of moral absolutism
(i.e. *"God's Law,"* *"Natural Law,"* *"Man's Nature,"* *"A is A"*) and
the narrow egotism which moral relativism so easily lends itself to.
Instead, anarchists recognise that there exists concepts of right and
wrong which exist outside of an individual's evaluation of their own
acts.

This is because of the social nature of humanity. The interactions
between individuals do develop into a social maxim which, according to
Kropotkin, can be summarised as *"[i]s it useful to society? Then it is
good. Is it hurtful? Then it is bad."* Which acts human beings think of
as right or wrong is not, however, unchanging and the *"estimate of what
is useful or harmful . . . changes, but the foundation remains the
same."* [*"Anarchist Morality"*, **Op. Cit.**, p. 91 and p. 92]

This sense of empathy, based upon a critical mind, is the fundamental
basis of social ethics - the 'what-should-be' can be seen as an ethical
criterion for the truth or validity of an objective 'what-is.' So, while
recognising the root of ethics in nature, anarchists consider ethics as
fundamentally a **human** idea - the product of life, thought and
evolution created by individuals and generalised by social living and
community.

So what, for anarchists, is unethical behaviour? Essentially anything
that denies the most precious achievement of history: the liberty,
uniqueness and dignity of the individual.

Individuals can see what actions are unethical because, due to empathy,
they can place themselves into the position of those suffering the
behaviour. Acts which restrict individuality can be considered unethical
for two (interrelated) reasons.

Firstly, the protection and development of individuality in all enriches
the life of every individual and it gives pleasure to individuals
because of the diversity it produces. This egoist basis of ethics
reinforces the second (social) reason, namely that individuality is good
for society for it enriches the community and social life, strengthening
it and allowing it to grow and evolve. As Bakunin constantly argued,
progress is marked by a movement from *"the simple to the complex"* or,
in the words of Herbert Read, it *"is measured by the degree of
differentiation within a society. If the individual is a unit in a
corporate mass, his [or her] life will be limited, dull, and mechanical.
If the individual is a unit on his [or her] own, with space and
potentiality for separate action . . .he can develop - develop in the
only real meaning of the word - develop in consciousness of strength,
vitality, and joy."* [*"The Philosophy of Anarchism,"* **Anarchy and
Order**, p. 37]

This defence of individuality is learned from nature. In an ecosystem,
diversity is strength and so biodiversity becomes a source of basic
ethical insight. In its most basic form, it provides a guide to *"help
us distinguish which of our actions serve the thrust of natural
evolution and which of them impede them."* [Murray Bookchin, **The
Ecology of Freedom**, p. 442]

So, the ethical concept *"lies in the feeling of sociality, inherent in
the entire animal world and in the conceptions of equity, which
constitutes one of the fundamental primary judgements of human reason."*
Therefore anarchists embrace *"the permanent presence of a **double
tendency** - towards greater development on the one side, of
**sociality**, and, on the other side, of a consequent increase of the
intensity of life which results in an increase of happiness for the
**individuals**, and in progress - physical, intellectual, and moral."*
[Kropotkin, **Ethics**, pp. 311-2 and pp. 19-20]

Anarchist attitudes to authority, the state, capitalism, private
property and so on all come from our ethical belief that the liberty of
individuals is of prime concern and that our ability to empathise with
others, to see ourselves in others (our basic equality and common
individuality, in other words).

Thus anarchism combines the subjective evaluation by individuals of a
given set of circumstances and actions with the drawing of objective
interpersonal conclusions of these evaluations based upon empathic
bounds and discussion between equals. Anarchism is based on a humanistic
approach to ethical ideas, one that evolves along with society and
individual development. Hence an **ethical** society is one in which
*"[d]ifference among people will be respected, indeed fostered, as
elements that enrich the unity of experience and phenomenon . . . [the
different] will be conceived of as individual parts of a whole all the
richer because of its complexity."* [Murray Bookchin, **Post Scarcity
Anarchism**, p. 82]

A.2.20 Why are most anarchists atheists?
----------------------------------------

It is a fact that most anarchists are atheists. They reject the idea of
god and oppose all forms of religion, particularly organised religion.
Today, in secularised western European countries, religion has lost its
once dominant place in society. This often makes the militant atheism of
anarchism seem strange. However, once the negative role of religion is
understood the importance of libertarian atheism becomes obvious. It is
because of the role of religion and its institutions that anarchists
have spent some time refuting the idea of religion as well as
propagandising against it.

So why do so many anarchists embrace atheism? The simplest answer is
that most anarchists are atheists because it is a logical extension of
anarchist ideas. If anarchism is the rejection of illegitimate
authorities, then it follows that it is the rejection of the so-called
Ultimate Authority, God. Anarchism is grounded in reason, logic, and
scientific thinking, not religious thinking. Anarchists tend to be
sceptics, and not believers. Most anarchists consider the Church to be
steeped in hypocrisy and the Bible a work of fiction, riddled with
contradictions, absurdities and horrors. It is notorious in its
debasement of women and its sexism is infamous. Yet men are treated
little better. Nowhere in the bible is there an acknowledgement that
human beings have inherent rights to life, liberty, happiness, dignity,
fairness, or self-government. In the bible, humans are sinners, worms,
and slaves (figuratively and literally, as it condones slavery). God has
all the rights, humanity is nothing.

This is unsurprisingly, given the nature of religion. Bakunin put it
best:

> "**The idea of God implies the abdication of human reason and justice;
> it is the most decisive negation of human liberty, and necessarily
> ends in the enslavement of mankind, both in theory and in practice.**
>
> "Unless, then, we desire the enslavement and degradation of mankind .
> . . we may not, must not make the slightest concession either to the
> God of theology or to the God of metaphysics. He who, in this mystical
> alphabet, begins with A will inevitably end with Z; he who desires to
> worship God must harbour no childish illusions about the matter, but
> bravely renounce his liberty and humanity.
>
> "If God is, man is a slave; now, man can and must be free; then, God
> does not exist." [**God and the State**, p. 25]

For most anarchists, then, atheism is required due to the nature of
religion. *"To proclaim as divine all that is grand, just, noble, and
beautiful in humanity,"* Bakunin argued, *"is to tacitly admit that
humanity of itself would have been unable to produce it -- that is,
that, abandoned to itself, its own nature is miserable, iniquitous,
base, and ugly. Thus we come back to the essence of all religion -- in
other words, to the disparagement of humanity for the greater glory of
divinity."* As such, to do justice to our humanity and the potential it
has, anarchists argue that we must do without the harmful myth of god
and all it entails and so on behalf of *"human liberty, dignity, and
prosperity, we believe it our duty to recover from heaven the goods
which it has stolen and return them to earth."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 37 and
p. 36]

As well as the theoretical degrading of humanity and its liberty,
religion has other, more practical, problems with it from an anarchist
point of view. Firstly, religions have been a source of inequality and
oppression. Christianity (like Islam), for example, has always been a
force for repression whenever it holds any political or social sway
(believing you have a direct line to god is a sure way of creating an
authoritarian society). The Church has been a force of social
repression, genocide, and the justification for every tyrant for nearly
two millennia. When given the chance it has ruled as cruelly as any
monarch or dictator. This is unsurprising:

> *"God being everything, the real world and man are nothing. God being
> truth, justice, goodness, beauty, power and life, man is falsehood,
> iniquity, evil, ugliness, impotence, and death. God being master, man
> is the slave. Incapable of finding justice, truth, and eternal life by
> his own effort, he can attain them only through a divine revelation.
> But whoever says revelation, says revealers, messiahs, prophets,
> priests, and legislators inspired by God himself; and these, as the
> holy instructors of humanity, chosen by God himself to direct it in
> the path of salvation, necessarily exercise absolute power. All men
> owe them passive and unlimited obedience; for against the divine
> reason there is no human reason, and against the justice of God no
> terrestrial justice holds."* [Bakunin, **Op. Cit.**, p. 24]

Christianity has only turned tolerant and peace-loving when it is
powerless and even then it has continued its role as apologist for the
powerful. This is the second reason why anarchists oppose the church for
when not being the source of oppression, the church has justified it and
ensured its continuation. It has kept the working class in bondage for
generations by sanctioning the rule of earthly authorities and teaching
working people that it is wrong to fight against those same authorities.
Earthly rulers received their legitimisation from the heavenly lord,
whether political (claiming that rulers are in power due to god's will)
or economic (the rich having been rewarded by god). The bible praises
obedience, raising it to a great virtue. More recent innovations like
the Protestant work ethic also contribute to the subjugation of working
people.

That religion is used to further the interests of the powerful can
quickly be seen from most of history. It conditions the oppressed to
humbly accept their place in life by urging the oppressed to be meek and
await their reward in heaven. As Emma Goldman argued, Christianity (like
religion in general) *"contains nothing dangerous to the regime of
authority and wealth; it stands for self-denial and self-abnegation, for
penance and regret, and is absolutely inert in the face of every
[in]dignity, every outrage imposed upon mankind."* [**Red Emma Speaks**,
p. 234]

Thirdly, religion has always been a conservative force in society. This
is unsurprising, as it bases itself not on investigation and analysis of
the real world but rather in repeating the truths handed down from above
and contained in a few holy books. Theism is then *"the theory of
speculation"* while atheism is *"the science of demonstration."* The
*"one hangs in the metaphysical clouds of the Beyond, while the other
has its roots firmly in the soil. It is the earth, not heaven, which man
must rescue if he is truly to be saved."* Atheism, then, *"expresses the
expansion and growth of the human mind"* while theism *"is static and
fixed."* It is *"the absolutism of theism, its pernicious influence upon
humanity, its paralysing effect upon thought and action, which Atheism
is fighting with all its power."* [Emma Goldman, **Op. Cit.**, p. 243,
p. 245 and pp. 246-7]

As the Bible says, *"By their fruits shall ye know them."* We anarchists
agree but unlike the church we apply this truth to religion as well.
That is why we are, in the main, atheists. We recognise the destructive
role played by the Church, and the harmful effects of organised
monotheism, particularly Christianity, on people. As Goldman summaries,
religion *"is the conspiracy of ignorance against reason, of darkness
against light, of submission and slavery against independence and
freedom; of the denial of strength and beauty, against the affirmation
of the joy and glory of life."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 240]

So, given the fruits of the Church, anarchists argue that it is time to
uproot it and plant new trees, the trees of reason and liberty.

That said, anarchists do not deny that religions contain important
ethical ideas or truths. Moreover, religions can be the base for strong
and loving communities and groups. They can offer a sanctuary from the
alienation and oppression of everyday life and offer a guide to action
in a world where everything is for sale. Many aspects of, say, Jesus' or
Buddha's life and teachings are inspiring and worth following. If this
were not the case, if religions were simply a tool of the powerful, they
would have long ago been rejected. Rather, they have a dual-nature in
that contain both ideas necessary to live a good life as well as
apologetics for power. If they did not, the oppressed would not believe
and the powerful would suppress them as dangerous heresies.

And, indeed, repression has been the fate of any group that has preached
a radical message. In the middle ages numerous revolutionary Christian
movements and sects were crushed by the earthly powers that be with the
firm support of the mainstream church. During the Spanish Civil War the
Catholic church supported Franco's fascists, denouncing the killing of
pro-Franco priests by supporters of the republic while remaining silent
about Franco's murder of Basque priests who had supported the
democratically elected government (Pope John Paul II is seeking to turn
the dead pro-Franco priests into saints while the pro-Republican priests
remain unmentioned). The Archbishop of El Salvador, Oscar Arnulfo
Romero, started out as a conservative but after seeing the way in which
the political and economic powers were exploiting the people became
their outspoken champion. He was assassinated by right-wing
paramilitaries in 1980 because of this, a fate which has befallen many
other supporters of liberation theology, a radical interpretation of the
Gospels which tries to reconcile socialist ideas and Christian social
thinking.

Nor does the anarchist case against religion imply that religious people
do not take part in social struggles to improve society. Far from it.
Religious people, including members of the church hierarchy, played a
key role in the US civil rights movement of the 1960s. The religious
belief within Zapata's army of peasants during the Mexican revolution
did not stop anarchists taking part in it (indeed, it had already been
heavily influenced by the ideas of anarchist militant Ricardo Flores
Magon). It is the dual-nature of religion which explains why many
popular movements and revolts (particularly by peasants) have used the
rhetoric of religion, seeking to keep the good aspects of their faith
will fighting the earthly injustice its official representatives
sanctify. For anarchists, it is the willingness to fight against
injustice which counts, not whether someone believes in god or not. We
just think that the social role of religion is to dampen down revolt,
not encourage it. The tiny number of radical priests compared to those
in the mainstream or on the right suggests the validity of our analysis.

It should be stressed that anarchists, while overwhelmingly hostile to
the idea of the Church and an established religion, do not object to
people practising religious belief on their own or in groups, so long as
that practice doesn't impinge on the liberties of others. For example, a
cult that required human sacrifice or slavery would be antithetical to
anarchist ideas, and would be opposed. But peaceful systems of belief
could exist in harmony within in anarchist society. The anarchist view
is that religion is a personal matter, above all else -- if people want
to believe in something, that's their business, and nobody else's as
long as they do not impose those ideas on others. All we can do is
discuss their ideas and try and convince them of their errors.

To end, it should noted that we are not suggesting that atheism is
somehow mandatory for an anarchist. Far from it. As we discuss in
[section A.3.7](secA3.html#seca37), there are anarchists who do believe
in god or some form of religion. For example, Tolstoy combined
libertarian ideas with a devote Christian belief. His ideas, along with
Proudhon's, influences the Catholic Worker organisation, founded by
anarchists Dorothy Day and Peter Maurin in 1933 and still active today.
The anarchist activist Starhawk, active in the current
anti-globalisation movement, has no problems also being a leading Pagan.
However, for most anarchists, their ideas lead them logically to atheism
for, as Emma Goldman put it, *"in its negation of gods is at the same
time the strongest affirmation of man, and through man, the eternal yea
to life, purpose, and beauty."* [**Red Emma Speaks**, p. 248]
