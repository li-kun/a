An Anarchist FAQ Webpage Contacts
---------------------------------

This web-site is the creation of many anarchists across the globe and is
a classic example of the power of freedom, equality and mutual aid.

It is produced by a [small collective of people](intro.html) who work on
the FAQ when we can (mostly in our free time, after work). This means
that any e-mail sent may take a while to be replied to. We apologise for
any delay, but we are not a corporate funded think-tank or full-time
members of a party apparatus. We hope you understand.

If you want to contact some of those responsible, then send email to
[anarchistfaq@yahoo.co.uk](mailto:anarchistfaq@yahoo.co.uk)
