J.5 What alternative social organisations do anarchists create?
===============================================================

Anarchism is all about ***"do it yourself"***: people helping each other
out in order to secure a good society to live within and to protect,
extend and enrich their personal freedom. As such anarchists are keenly
aware of the importance of building alternatives to both capitalism and
the state in the here and now. Only by creating practical alternatives
can we show that anarchism is a viable possibility and train ourselves
in the techniques and responsibilities of freedom:

> *"If we put into practice the principles of libertarian communism
> within our organisations, the more advanced and prepared we will be on
> that day when we come to adopt it completely."* [C.N.T. member, quoted
> by Graham Kelsey, **Anarchosyndicalism, Libertarian Communism and the
> State**,p. 79]

This idea (to quote the IWW) of *"building a new world in the shell of
the old"* is a long standing one in anarchism. Proudhon during the 1848
revolution *"propose[d] that a provisional committee be set up"* in
Paris and *"liaise with similar committees"* elsewhere in France. This
would be *"a body representative of the proletariat . . ., a state
within the state, in opposition to the bourgeois representatives."* He
proclaimed to working class people that *"a new society be founded in
the heart of the old society"* for *"the government can do nothing for
you. But you can do everything for yourselves."* [*"Aux Pariotes"*, **La
ReprÃ©santant du Peuple**, No. 33] This was echoed by Bakunin (see
[section H.2.8](secH2.html#sech28)) while for revolutionary syndicalists
the aim was *"to constitute within the bourgeois State a veritable
socialist (economic and anarchic) State."* [Fernand Pelloutier, quoted
by Jeremy Jennings, **Syndicalism in France**, p. 22] By so doing we
help create the environment within which individuals can manage their
own affairs and develop their abilities to do so. In other words, we
create ***"schools of anarchism"*** which lay the foundations for a
better society as well as promoting and supporting social struggle
against the current system. Make no mistake, the alternatives we discuss
in this section are not an alternative to direct action and the need for
social struggle - they are an expression of social struggle and a form
of direct action. They are the framework by which social struggle can
build and strengthen the anarchist tendencies within capitalist society
which will ultimately replace it.

Therefore it is wrong to think that libertarians are indifferent to
making life more bearable, even more enjoyable, under capitalism. A free
society will not just appear from nowhere, it will be created be
individuals and communities with a long history of social struggle and
organisation. For as Wilheim Reich so correctly pointed out:

> *"Quite obviously, a society that is to consist of 'free individuals,'
> to constitute a 'free community' and to administer itself, i.e. to
> 'govern itself,' cannot be suddenly created by decrees. It has to
> **evolve** organically."* [**The Mass Psychology of Fascism**, p. 241]

It is this organic evolution that anarchists promote when they create
libertarian alternatives within capitalist society. These alternatives
(be they workplace or community unions, co-operatives, mutual banks, and
so on) are marked by certain common features such as being self-managed,
being based upon equality, decentralised and working with other groups
and associations within a confederal network based upon mutual aid and
solidarity. In other words, they are **anarchist** in both spirit and
structure and so create a practical bridge between now and the future
free society.

Anarchists consider the building of alternatives as a key aspect of
their activity under capitalism. This is because they, like all forms of
direct action, are ***"schools of anarchy"*** and also because they make
the transition to a free society easier. *"Through the organisations set
up for the defence of their interests,"* in Malatesta's words, *"the
workers develop an awareness of the oppression they suffer and the
antagonism that divides them from the bosses and as a result begin to
aspire to a better life, become accustomed to collective struggle and
solidarity and win those improvements that are possible within the
capitalist and state regime."* [**The Anarchist Revolution**, p. 95] By
creating viable examples of **"anarchy in action"** we can show that our
ideas are practical and convince people that they are not utopian.
Therefore this section of the FAQ will indicate the alternatives
anarchists support and **why** we support them.

The approach anarchists take to this activity could be termed ***"social
unionism"*** -- the collective action of groups to change certain
aspects (and, ultimately, all aspects) of their lives. This takes many
different forms in many different areas (some of which, not all, are
discussed here) -- but they share the same basic aspects of collective
direct action, self-organisation, self-management, solidarity and mutual
aid. These are a means *"of raising the morale of the workers, accustom
them to free initiative and solidarity in a struggle for the good of
everyone and render them capable of imagining, desiring and putting into
practice an anarchist life."* [Malatesta, **Op. Cit.**, p. 28] Kropotkin
summed up the anarchist perspective well when he argued that working
class people had *"to form their own organisations for a direct struggle
against capitalism"* and to *"take possession of the necessaries for
production, and to control production."* [**Memiors of a
Revolutionist**, p. 359] As historian J. Romero Maura correctly
summarised, the *"anarchist revolution, when it came, would be
essentially brought about by the working class. Revolutionaries needed
to gather great strength and must beware of underestimating the strength
of reaction"* and so anarchists *"logically decided that revolutionaries
had better organise along the lines of labour organisations."* [*"The
Spanish case"*, pp. 60-83, **Anarchism Today**, D. Apter and J. Joll
(eds.), p. 66]

As will quickly become obvious in this discussion (as if it had not been
so before!) anarchists are firm supporters of ***"self-help,"*** an
expression that has been sadly corrupted (like freedom) by the right in
recent times. Like freedom, self-help should be saved from the clutches
of the right who have no real claim to that expression. Indeed,
anarchism was created from and based itself upon working class self-help
-- for what other interpretation can be gathered from Proudhon's 1848
statement that *"the proletariat must emancipate itself"*? [quoted by
George Woodcock, **Pierre-Joseph Proudhon**, p. 125] So Anarchists have
great faith in the abilities of working class people to work out for
themselves what their problems are and act to solve them.

Anarchist support and promotion of alternatives is a **key** aspect of
this process of self-liberation, and so a key aspect of anarchism. While
strikes, boycotts, and other forms of high profile direct action may be
more "sexy" than the long and hard task of creating and building social
alternatives, these are the nuts and bolts of creating a new world as
well as the infrastructure which supports the other activities. These
alternatives involve both combative organisations (such as community and
workplace unions) as well as more defensive and supportive ones (such as
co-operatives and mutual banks). Both have their part to play in the
class struggle, although the combative ones are the most important in
creating the spirit of revolt and the possibility of creating an
anarchist society.

We must also stress that anarchists look to organic tendencies within
social struggle as the basis of any alternatives we try to create. As
Kropotkin put it, anarchism is based *"on an analysis of **tendencies of
an evolution that is already going on in society**, and on **induction**
therefrom as to the future."* It is *"representative . . . of the
creative, instructive power of the people themselves who aimed at
developing institutions of common law in order to protect them from the
power-seeking minority."* Anarchism bases itself on those tendencies
that are created by the self-activity of working class people and while
developing within capitalism are **in opposition** to it -- such
tendencies are expressed in organisational form as unions and other
forms of workplace struggle, co-operatives (both productive and credit),
libertarian schools, and so on. For anarchism was *"born among the
people -- in the struggles of real life and not in the philosopher's
studio"* and owes its *"origin to the constructive, creative activity of
the people . . . and to a protest -- a revolt against the external force
which had thrust itself upon"* social institutions. [**Anarchism**, p.
158, p. 147, p. 150 and p. 149] This *"creative activity"* is expressed
in the organisations created in the class struggle by working people,
some of which we discuss in this section of the FAQ. Therefore, the
alternatives anarchists support should not be viewed in isolation of
social struggle and working class resistance to hierarchy -- the reverse
in fact, as these alternatives are almost always expressions of that
struggle.

Lastly, we should note we do not list all the forms of organisation
anarchists create. For example, we have ignored solidarity groups (for
workers on strike or in defence of struggles in other countries) and
organisations which are created to campaign against or for certain
issues or reforms. Anarchists are in favour of such organisations and
work within them to spread anarchist ideas, tactics and organisational
forms. However, these interest groups (while very useful) do not provide
a framework for lasting change as do the ones we highlight below (see
[section J.1.4](secJ1.html#secj14) for more details on anarchist
opinions on such "single issue" campaigns). We have also ignored what
have been called *"intentional communities."* This is when a group of
individuals squat or buy land and other resources within capitalism and
create their own anarchist commune in it. Most anarchists reject this
idea as capitalism and the state must be fought, not ignored. In
addition, due to their small size, they are rarely viable experiments in
communal living and nearly always fail after a short time (for a good
summary of Kropotkin's attitude to such communities, which can be taken
as typical, see Graham Purchase's **Evolution & Revolution** [pp.
122-125]). Dropping out will not stop capitalism and the state and while
such communities may try to ignore the system, they will find that the
system will not ignore them -- they will come under competitive and
ecological pressures from capitalism whether they like it or not
assuming they avoid direct political interference.

So the alternatives we discuss here are attempts to create anarchist
alternatives within capitalism and which aim to **change** it (either by
revolutionary or evolutionary means). They are based upon
**challenging** capitalism and the state, not ignoring them by dropping
out. Only by a process of direct action and building alternatives which
are relevant to our daily lives can we revolutionise and change both
ourselves and society.

J.5.1 What is community unionism?
---------------------------------

Community unionism is our term for the process of creating participatory
communities (called "communes" in classical anarchism) within the
current society in order to transform it.

Basically, a community union is the creation of interested members of a
community who decide to form an organisation to fight against injustice
and improvements locally. It is a forum by which inhabitants can raise
issues that affect themselves and others and provide a means of solving
these problems. As such, it is a means of directly involving local
people in the life of their own communities and collectively solving the
problems facing them as both individuals and as part of a wider society.
In this way, local people take part in deciding what effects them and
their community and create a self-managed "dual power" to the local and
national state. They also, by taking part in self-managed community
assemblies, develop their ability to participate and manage their own
affairs, so showing that the state is unnecessary and harmful to their
interests. Politics, therefore, is not separated into a specialised
activity that only certain people do (i.e. politicians). Instead, it
becomes communalised and part of everyday life and in the hands of all.

As would be imagined, like the participatory communities that would
exist in an anarchist society (see [section I.5](secI5.html)), the
community union would be based upon a mass assembly of its members. Here
would be discussed the issues that effect the membership and how to
solve them. Thus issues like rent increases, school closures, rising
cost of living, taxation, cuts and state-imposed "reforms" to the nature
and quality of public services, utilities and resources, repressive laws
and so on could be debated and action taken to combat them. Like the
communes of a future anarchy, these community unions would be
confederated with other unions in different areas in order to
co-ordinate joint activity and solve common problems. These
confederations would be based upon self-management, mandated and
recallable delegates and the creation of administrative action
committees to see that the memberships decisions are carried out.

The community union could also raise funds for strikes and other social
protests, organise pickets, boycotts and generally aid others in
struggle. By organising their own forms of direct action (such as tax
and rent strikes, environmental protests and so on) they can weaken the
state while building an self-managed infrastructure of co-operatives to
replace the useful functions the state or capitalist firms currently
provide. So, in addition to organising resistance to the state and
capitalist firms, these community unions could play an important role in
creating an alternative economy within capitalism. For example, such
unions could have a mutual bank or credit union associated with them
which could allow funds to be gathered for the creation of self-managed
co-operatives and social services and centres. In this way a
communalised co-operative sector could develop, along with a communal
confederation of community unions and their co-operative banks.

Such community unions have been formed in many different countries in
recent years to fight against numerous attacks on the working class. In
the late 1980s and early 1990s groups were created in neighbourhoods
across Britain to organise non-payment of the Conservative government's
Community Charge (popularly known as the poll tax, this tax was
independent on income and was based on the electoral register).
Federations of these groups were created to co-ordinate the struggle and
pull resources and, in the end, ensured that the government withdrew the
hated tax and helped push Thatcher out of government. In Ireland,
similar groups were formed to defeat the privatisation of the water
industry by a similar non-payment campaign in the mid-1990s.

However, few of these groups have been taken as part of a wider strategy
to empower the local community but the few that have indicate the
potential of such a strategy. This potential can be seen from two
examples of libertarian community organising in Europe, one in Italy and
another in Spain, while the neighbourhood assemblies in Argentina show
that such popular self-government can and does develop spontaneously in
struggle.

In Southern Italy, anarchists organised a very successful **Municipal
Federation of the Base** (FMB) in Spezzano Albanese. This organisation,
in the words of one activist, is *"an alternative to the power of the
town hall"* and provides a *"glimpse of what a future libertarian
society could be."* Its aim is *"the bringing together of all interests
within the district. In intervening at a municipal level, we become
involved not only in the world of work but also the life of the
community . . . the FMB make counter proposals [to Town Hall decisions],
which aren't presented to the Council but proposed for discussion in the
area to raise people's level of consciousness. Whether they like it or
not the Town Hall is obliged to take account of these proposals."* In
addition, the FMB also supports co-operatives within it, so creating a
communalised, self-managed economic sector within capitalism. Such a
development helps to reduce the problems facing isolated co-operatives
in a capitalist economy -- see [section J.5.11](secJ5.html#secj511) --
and was actively done in order to *"seek to bring together all the
currents, all the problems and contradictions, to seek solutions"* to
such problems facing co-operatives. [*"Community Organising in Southern
Italy"*, pp. 16-19, **Black Flag**, no. 210, p. 17 and p. 18]

Elsewhere in Europe, the long, hard work of the C.N.T. in Spain has also
resulted in mass village assemblies being created in the Puerto Real
area, near Cadiz. These community assemblies came about to support an
industrial struggle by shipyard workers. One C.N.T. member explains:
*"Every Thursday of every week, in the towns and villages in the area,
we had all-village assemblies where anyone connected with the particular
issue [of the rationalisation of the shipyards], whether they were
actually workers in the shipyard itself, or women or children or
grandparents, could go along . . . and actually vote and take part in
the decision making process of what was going to take place."* With such
popular input and support, the shipyard workers won their struggle.
However, the assembly continued after the strike and *"managed to link
together twelve different organisations within the local area that are
all interested in fighting . . . various aspects"* of capitalism
including health, taxation, economic, ecological and cultural issues.
Moreover, the struggle *"created a structure which was very different
from the kind of structure of political parties, where the decisions are
made at the top and they filter down. What we managed to do in Puerto
Real was make decisions at the base and take them upwards."*
[**Anarcho-Syndicalism in Puerto Real: from shipyard resistance to
direct democracy and community control**, p. 6]

More recently, the December 2001 revolt against neo-liberalism in
Argentina saw hundreds of neighbourhood assemblies created across the
country. These quickly federated into *inter-barrial* assemblies to
co-ordinate struggles. The assemblies occupied buildings, created
communal projects like popular kitchens, community centres, day-care
centres and built links with occupied workplaces. As one participant put
it: *"The initial vocabulary was simply: Let's do things for ourselves,
and do them right. Let's decide for ourselves. Let's decide
democratically, and if we do, then let's explicitly agree that we're all
equals here, that there are no bosses . . . We lead ourselves. We lead
together. We lead and decide amongst ourselves . . . no one invented it
. . . It just happened. We met one another on the corner and decided,
enough! . . . Let's invent new organisational forms and reinvent
society."* Another notes that this was people who *"begin to solve
problems themselves, without turning to the institutions that caused the
problems in the first place."* The neighbourhood assemblies ended a
system in which *"we elected people to make our decisions for us . . .
now we will make our own decisions."* While the *"anarchist movement has
been talking about these ideas for years"* the movement took them up
*"from necessity."* [Marina Sitrin (ed.), **Horizontalism: Voices of
Popular Power in Argentina**, p. 41 and pp. 38-9]

The idea of community organising has long existed within anarchism.
Kropotkin pointed to the directly democratic assemblies of Paris during
the French Revolution\> These were *"constituted as so many mediums of
popular administration, it remained of the people, and this is what made
the revolutionary power of these organisations."* This ensured that the
local revolutionary councils *"which sprang from the popular movement
was not separated from the people."* In this popular self-organisation
*"the masses, accustoming themselves to act without receiving orders
from the national representatives, were practising what was described
later on as Direct Self-Government."* These assemblies federated to
co-ordinate joint activity but it was based on their permanence: *"that
is, the possibility of calling the general assembly whenever it was
wanted by the members of the section and of discussing everything in the
general assembly."* In short, *"the Commune of Paris was not to be a
governed State, but a people governing itself directly -- when possible
-- without intermediaries, without masters"* and so *"the principles of
anarchism . . . had their origin, not in theoretic speculations, but in
the **deeds** of the Great French Revolution."* This *"laid the
foundations of a new, free, social organisation"*and Kropotkin predicted
that *"the libertarians would no doubt do the same to-day."* [**Great
French Revolution**, vol. 1, p. 201, p. 203, pp. 210-1, p. 210, p. 204
and p. 206]

In Chile during 1925 *"a grass roots movement of great significance
emerged,"* the tenant leagues (*ligas do arrendatarios*). The movement
pledged to pay half their rent beginning the 1st of February, 1925, at
huge public rallies (it should also be noted that *"Anarchist labour
unionists had formed previous ligas do arrendatarios in 1907 and
1914."*). The tenants leagues were organised by ward and federated into
a city-wide council. It was a vast organisation, with 12,000 tenants in
just one ward of Santiago alone. The movement also *"press[ed] for a law
which would legally recognise the lower rents they had begun paying . .
. the leagues voted to declare a general strike . . . should a rent law
not be passed."* The government gave in, although the landlords tried to
get around it and, in response, on April 8th *"the anarchists in
Santiago led a general strike in support of the universal rent reduction
of 50 percent."* Official figures showed that rents *"fell sharply
during 1915, due in part to the rent strikes"* and for the anarchists
*"the tenant league movement had been the first step toward a new social
order in Chile."* [Peter DeShazo, **Urban Workers and Labor Unions in
Chile 1902-1927**, p. 223, p. 327, p. 223, p. 225 and p. 226] As one
Anarchist newspaper put it:

> *"This movement since its first moments had been essentially
> revolutionary. The tactics of direct action were preached by
> libertarians with highly successful results, because they managed to
> instil in the working classes the idea that if landlords would not
> accept the 50 percent lowering of rents, they should pay nothing at
> all. In libertarian terms, this is the same as taking possession of
> common property. It completes the first stage of what will become a
> social revolution."* [quoted by DeShazo, **Op. Cit.**, p. 226]

A similar concern for community organising and struggle was expressed in
Spain. While the collectives during the revolution are well known, the
CNT had long organised in the community and around non-workplace issues.
As well as neighbourhood based defence committees to organise and
co-ordinate struggles and insurrections, the CNT organised various
community based struggles. The most famous example of this must be the
rent strikes during the early 1930s in Barcelona. In 1931, the CNT's
Construction Union organised a **"Economic Defence Commission"** to
organise against high rents and lack of affordable housing. Its basic
demand was for a 40% rent decrease but it also addressed unemployment
and the cost of food. The campaign was launched by a mass meeting on May
1st, 1931. A series of meetings were held in the various working class
neighbourhoods of Barcelona and in surrounding suburbs. This culminated
in a mass meeting held at the Palace of Fine Arts on July 5th which
raised a series of demands for the movement. By July, 45,000 people were
taking part in the rent strike and this rose to over 100,000 by August.
As well as refusing to pay rent, families were placed back into their
homes from which they had been evicted. The movement spread to a number
of the outlying towns which set up their own Economic Defence
Commissions. The local groups co-ordinated actions their actions out of
CNT union halls or local libertarian community centres. The movement
faced increased state repression but in many parts of Barcelona
landlords had been forced to come to terms with their tenants, agreeing
to reduced rents rather than facing the prospect of having no income for
an extended period or the landlord simply agreed to forget the unpaid
rents from the period of the rent strike. [Nick Rider, *"The Practice of
Direct Action: the Barcelona rent strike of 1931"*, **For Anarchism**,
David Goodway (ed.), pp. 79-105] As Abel Paz summarised:

> *"Unemployed workers did not receive or ask for state aid . . . The
> workers' first response to the economic crisis was the rent, gas, and
> electricity strike in mid-1933, which the CNT and FAI's Economic
> Defence Committee had been laying the foundations for since 1931.
> Likewise, house, street, and neighbourhood groups began to turn out en
> masse to stop evictions and other coercive acts ordered by the
> landlords (always with police support). The people were constantly
> mobilised. Women and youngsters were particularly active; it was they
> who challenged the police and stopped the endless evictions."*
> [**Durrutu in the Spanish Revolution**, p. 308]

In Gijon, the CNT *"reinforced its populist image by . . . its direct
consumer campaigns. Some of these were organised through the
federation's Anti-Unemployment Committee, which sponsored numerous
rallies and marches in favour of 'bread and work.' While they focused on
the issue of jobs, they also addressed more general concerns about the
cost of living for poor families. In a May 1933 rally, for example,
demonstrators asked that families of unemployed workers not be evicted
from their homes, even if they fell behind on the rent."* The
*"organisers made the connections between home and work and tried to
draw the entire family into the struggle."* However, the CNT's *"most
concerted attempt to bring in the larger community was the formation of
a new syndicate, in the spring of 1932, for the Defence of Public
Interests (SDIP). In contrast to a conventional union, which comprised
groups of workers, the SDIP was organised through neighbourhood
committees. Its specific purpose was to enforce a generous renters'
rights law of December 1931 that had not been vigorously implemented.
Following anarchosyndicalist strategy, the SDIP utilised various forms
of direct action, from rent strikes, to mass demonstrations, to the
reversal of evictions."* This last action involved the local SDIP group
going to a home, breaking the judge's official eviction seal and
carrying the furniture back in from the street. They left their own
sign: *"**opened by order** of the CNT."* The CNT's direct action
strategies *"helped keep political discourse in the street, and
encouraged people to pursue the same extra-legal channels of activism
that they had developed under the monarchy."* [Pamela Beth Radcliff,
**From mobilization to civil war**, pp. 287-288 and p. 289]

In these ways, grassroots movements from below were created, with direct
democracy and participation becoming an inherent part of a local
political culture of resistance, with people deciding things for
themselves directly and without hierarchy. Such developments are the
embryonic structures of a world based around participation and
self-management, with a strong and dynamic community life. For, as
Martin Buber argued, *"[t]he more a human group lets itself be
represented in the management of its common affairs . . . the less
communal life there is in it and the more impoverished it becomes as a
community."* [**Paths in Utopia**, p. 133]

Anarchist support and encouragement of community unionism, by creating
the means for communal self-management, helps to enrich the community as
well as creating the organisational forms required to resist the state
and capitalism. In this way we build the anti-state which will
(hopefully) replace the state. Moreover, the combination of community
unionism with workplace assemblies (as in Puerto Real), provides a
mutual support network which can be very effective in helping winning
struggles. For example, in Glasgow, Scotland in 1916, a massive rent
strike was finally won when workers came out in strike in support of the
rent strikers who been arrested for non-payment. Such developments
indicate that Isaac Puente was correct:

> *"Libertarian Communism is a society organised without the state and
> without private ownership. And there is no need to invent anything or
> conjure up some new organisation for the purpose. The centres about
> which life in the future will be organised are already with us in the
> society of today: the free union and the free municipality [or
> Commune].*

> *"**The union**: in it combine spontaneously the workers from
> factories and all places of collective exploitation.*

> *"And **the free municipality**: an assembly . . . where, again in
> spontaneity, inhabitants . . . combine together, and which points the
> way to the solution of problems in social life . . .*

> *"Both kinds of organisation, run on federal and democratic
> principles, will be sovereign in their decision making, without being
> beholden to any higher body, their only obligation being to federate
> one with another as dictated by the economic requirement for liaison
> and communications bodies organised in industrial federations.*

> *"The **union and the free municipality** will assume the collective
> or common ownership of everything which is under private ownership at
> present [but collectively used] and will regulate production and
> consumption (in a word, the economy) in each locality.*

*"The very bringing together of the two terms (communism and
libertarian) is indicative in itself of the fusion of two ideas: one of
them is collectivist, tending to bring about harmony in the whole
through the contributions and co-operation of individuals, without
undermining their independence in any way; while the other is
individualist, seeking to reassure the individual that his independence
will be respected."* [**Libertarian Communism**, pp. 6-7]

The combination of community unionism, along with industrial unionism
(see [next section](secJ5.html#secj52)), will be the key to creating an
anarchist society, Community unionism, by creating the free commune
within the state, allows us to become accustomed to managing our own
affairs and seeing that an injury to one is an injury to all. In this
way a social power is created in opposition to the state. The town
council may still be in the hands of politicians, but neither they nor
the central government would be able to move without worrying about what
the people's reaction might be, as expressed and organised in their
community assemblies and federations.

J.5.2 Why do anarchists support industrial unionism?
----------------------------------------------------

Simply because it is effective in resisting capitalist exploitation and
winning reforms, ending capitalist oppression and expresses our ideas on
how industry will be organised in an anarchist society. For workers
*"have the most enormous power in their hands, and, if they once become
thoroughly conscious of it and used it, nothing could withstand them;
they would only have to stop labour, regard the product of labour as
theirs, and enjoy it. This is the sense of the labour disturbances which
show themselves here and there."* [Max Stirner, **The Ego and Its Own**,
p. 116] Industrial unionism is simply libertarian workplace organisation
and is the best way of organising and exercising this power.

Before discussing why anarchists support industrial unionism, we must
point out that the type of unionism anarchists support has very little
in common with that associated with reformist unions like the TUC in
Britain or the AFL-CIO in the USA (see [next
section](secJ5.html#secj53)). In such unions, as Alexander Berkman
pointed out, the *"rank and file have little say. They have delegated
their power to leaders, and these have become the boss . . . Once you do
that, the power you have delegated will be used against you and your
interests every time."* [**What is Anarchism?**, p. 205] Reformist
unions, even if they do organise by industry rather than by trade or
craft, are top-heavy and bureaucratic. Thus they are organised in the
same manner as capitalist firms or the state -- and like both of these,
the officials at the top have different interests than those at the
bottom. Little wonder anarchists oppose such forms of unionism as being
counter to the interests of their members. The long history of union
officials betraying their members is proof enough of this.

Anarchists propose a different kind of workplace organisation, one that
is organised in a different manner than the mainstream unions. We will
call this new kind of organisation ***"industrial unionism"*** (although
perhaps industrial syndicalism, or just syndicalism, might be a better
name for it). Some anarchists (particularly communist-anarchists) reject
calling these workplace organisations "unions" and instead prefer such
terms as workplace resistance groups, workplace assemblies and workers
councils. No matter what they are called, all class struggle anarchists
support the same organisational structure we are going to outline. It is
purely for convenience that we term this industrial unionism.

An industrial union is a union which organises all workers in a given
workplace and so regardless of their actual trade everyone would be in
the one union. On a building site, for example, brick-layers, plumbers,
carpenters and so on would all be a member of the Building Workers
Union. Each trade may have its own sections within the union (so that
plumbers can discuss issues relating to their trade for example) but the
core decision making focus would be an assembly of all workers employed
in a workplace. As they all have the same employer, the same exploiter,
it is logical for them to have the same union.

It is organised by the guiding principle that workers should directly
control their own organisations and struggles. It is based upon
workplace assemblies because workers have *"tremendous power"* as the
*"creator of all wealth"* but *"the strength of the worker is not in the
union meeting-hall; it is in the shop and factory, in the mill and mine.
It is **there** that he [or she] must organise; there, on the job."* It
is there that workers *"decide the matters at issue and carry their
decisions out through the shop committees"* (whose members are *"under
the direction and supervision of the workers"* and can be *"recalled at
will"*). These committees are *"associated locally, regionally and
nationally"* to produce *"a power tremendous in its scope and
potentialities."* [Berkman, **Op. Cit.**, pp. 205-6] This confederation
is usually organised on two directions, between different workplaces in
the same industry as well as between different workplaces in the same
locality.

So industrial unionism is different from ordinary trade unionism
(usually called business unionism by anarchists and syndicalists as it
treats the union's job purely as the seller of its members' labour
power). It is based on unions managed directly by the rank and file
membership rather than by elected officials and bureaucrats. The
industrial union is not based on where the worker lives (as is the case
with many trade unions). Instead, the union is based and run from the
workplace. It is there that union meetings are held, where workers are
exploited and oppressed and where their economic power lies. Industrial
unionism is based on local branch autonomy, with each branch managing
its own affairs. No union officials have the power to declare strikes
"unofficial" as every strike is decided upon by the membership is
automatically "official" simply because the branch decided it in a mass
meeting.

Power in such an organisation would be decentralised into the hands of
the membership, as expressed in local workplace assemblies. To
co-ordinate strikes and other forms of action, these autonomous branches
are part of a federal structure. The mass meeting in the workplace
mandates delegates to express the wishes of the membership at "labour
councils" and "industrial federations." The labour council (*"Brouse du
Travail"*, in French) is the federation of all workplace branches of all
industries in a geographical area (say, for example, in a city or
region) and it has the tasks of, among other things, education,
propaganda and the promotion of solidarity between the different
workplaces in its area. Due to the fact it combines all workers into one
organisation, regardless of industry or union, the labour council plays
a key role in increasing **class** consciousness and solidarity. The
industrial federation organises all workplaces in the same industry so
ensuring that workers in one part of the country or world are not
producing goods so that the bosses *"can supply the market and lose
nothing by the strike"*. So these federations are *"organised not by
craft or trade but by industries, so that the whole industry -- and if
necessary the whole working class -- could strike as one man."* If that
were done *"would any strike be lost?"* [Berkman, **Op. Cit.**, p. 82]
In practice, of course, the activities of these dual federations would
overlap: labour councils would support an industry wide strike or action
while industrial unions would support action conducted by its member
unions called by labour councils.

However, industrial unionism should **not** be confused with a closed
shop situation where workers are forced to join a union when they become
a wage slave in a workplace. While anarchists do desire to see all
workers unite in one organisation, it is vitally important that workers
can leave a union and join another. The closed shop only empowers union
bureaucrats and gives them even more power to control (and/or ignore)
their members. As anarchist unionism has no bureaucrats, there is no
need for the closed shop and its voluntary nature is essential in order
to ensure that a union be subject to "exit" as well as "voice" for it to
be responsive to its members wishes. As Albert Meltzer argued, the
closed shop means that *"the [trade union] leadership becomes
all-powerful since once it exerts its right to expel a member, that
person is not only out of the union, but out of a job."*
Anarcho-syndicalism, therefore, *"rejects the closed shop and relies on
voluntary membership, and so avoids any leadership or bureaucracy."*
[**Anarchism: Arguments for and against**, p. 56] Without voluntary
membership even the most libertarian union may become bureaucratic and
unresponsive to the needs of its members and the class struggle (also
see Tom Wetzel's excellent article *"The Origins of the Union Shop"*,
[**Ideas & Action** no. 11]). Needless to say, if the union membership
refuses to work with non-union members then that is a different
situation. Then this is an issue of free association (as free
association clearly implies the right **not** to associate). This issue
rarely arises and most syndicalist unions operate in workplaces with
other unions (the excepts arise, as happened frequently in Spanish
labour history with the Marxist UGT, when the other union scabs when
workers are on strike).

In industrial unionism, the membership, assembled in their place of
work, are the ones to decide when to strike, when to pay strike pay,
what tactics to use, what demands to make, what issues to fight over and
whether an action is "official" or "unofficial". In this way the rank
and file is in control of their union and, by confederating with other
assemblies, they co-ordinate their forces with their fellow workers. As
syndicalist activist Tom Brown made clear:

> *"The basis of the Syndicate is the mass meeting of workers assembled
> at their place of work . . . The meeting elects its factory committee
> and delegates. The factory Syndicate is federated to all other such
> committees in the locality . . . In the other direction, the factory,

> *"The factory Syndicate has full autonomy over its own affairs."*
> [**Syndicalism**, pp. 35-36]

Such federalism exists to co-ordinate struggle, to ensure that
solidarity becomes more than a word written on banners. We are sure that
many radicals will argue that such decentralised, confederal
organisations would produce confusion and disunity. However, anarchists
maintain that the statist, centralised form of organisation of the
trades unions would produce indifference instead of involvement,
heartlessness instead of solidarity, uniformity instead of unity, and
elites instead of equality. The centralised form of organisation has
been tried and tried again -- it has always failed. This is why the
industrial union rejects centralisation, for it *"takes control too far
away from the place of struggle to be effective on the workers' side."*
[Brown, **Op. Cit.**, p. 34] Centralisation leads to disempowerment,
which in turn leads to indifference, **not** solidarity. Rudolf Rocker
reminds us of the evil effects of centralism when he wrote:

> *"For the state centralisation is the appropriate form of

> [**Anarcho-Syndicalism**, p. 61]

Centralised unions ensure that it is the highest level of union
officialdom which decides when workers are allowed to strike. Instead of
those affected acting, *"the dispute must be reported to the district
office of the union (and in some cases to an area office) then to head
office, then back again . . . The worker is not allowed any direct
approach to, or control of the problem."* [Brown, **Op. Cit.**, p. 34]
The end result is that *"through the innate conservatism of
officialdom"* officials in centralised unions *"ordinarily use their
great powers to prevent strikes or to drive their unions' members back
to work after they have struck in concert with other workers."* The
notion that a centralised organisation will be more radical *"has not
developed in practice"* and the key problem *"is due not to the autonomy
of the unions, but to the lack of it."* [Earl C. Ford and William Z.
Foster, **Syndicalism**, p. 38] So the industrial union *"is based on
the principles of Federalism, on free combination from below upwards,
putting the right of self-determination . . . above everything else"*
and so rejects centralism as an *"artifical organisation from above
downwards which turns over the affairs of everybody in a lump to a small
minority"* and is *"always attended by barren official routine"* as well
as *"lifeless discipline and bureaucratic ossification."* [Rocker, **Op.
Cit.**, p. 60]

This implies that as well as being decentralised and organised from the
bottom up, the industrial union differs from the normal trade union by
having no full-time officials. All union business is conducted by
elected fellow workers who do their union activities after work or, if
it has to be done during work hours, they get the wages they lost while
on union business. In this way no bureaucracy of well paid officials is
created and all union militants remain in direct contact with their
fellow workers. Given that it is **their** wages, working conditions and
so on that are effected by their union activity they have a real
interest in making the union an effective organisation and ensuring that
it reflects the interests of the rank and file. In addition, all
part-time union "officials" are elected, mandated and recallable
delegates. If the fellow worker who is elected to the local labour
council or other union committee is not reflecting the opinions of those
who mandated him or her then the union assembly can countermand their
decision, recall them and replace them with someone who **will** reflect
these decisions. In short, *"the Syndicalist stands firmly by these
things -- mass meetings, delegates not bosses, the right of recall . . .
Syndicalism is organised from the bottom upwards . . . all power comes
from below and is controlled from below. This is a revolutionary
principle."* [Brown, **Op. Cit.**, p. 85]

As can be seen, industrial unionism reflects anarchist ideas of
organisation -- it is organised from the bottom up, it is decentralised
and based upon federation and it is directly managed by its members in
mass assemblies. It is anarchism applied to industry and the needs of
the class struggle. By supporting such forms of organisations,
anarchists are not only seeing *"anarchy in action"*, they are forming
effective tools which can win the class war. By organising in this
manner, workers are building the framework of a co-operative society
within capitalism:

> *"the syndicate . . . has for its purpose the defence of the interests
> of the producers within existing society and the preparing for and the
> practical carrying out of the reconstruction of social life . . . It
> has, therefore, a double purpose: 1. As the fighting organisation of
> the workers against their employers to enforce the demands of the
> workers for the safeguarding of their standard of living; 2. As the
> school for the intellectual training of the workers to make them
> acquainted with the technical management of production and economic
> life in general, so that when a revolutionary situation arises they
> will be capable of taking the socio-economic organism into their own
> hands and remaking it according to Socialist principles."* [Rocker,
> **Op. Cit.**, pp. 56-7]

So *"[a]t the same time that syndicalism exerts this unrelenting
pressure on capitalism, it tries to build the new social order within
the old. The unions and the 'labour councils' are not merely means of
struggle and instruments of social revolution; they are also the very
structure around which to build a free society. The workers are to be
educated in the job of destroying the old propertied order and in the
task of reconstructing a stateless, libertarian society. The two go
together."* [Murray Bookchin, **The Spanish Anarchists**, p. 121] The
industrial union is seen as prefiguring the future society, a society
which (like the union) is decentralised and self-managed in all aspects.

Given the fact that workers wages have been stagnating (or, at best,
falling behind productivity increases) across the world as the trade
unions have been weakened and marginalised (partly because of their own
tactics, structure and politics) it is clear that there exists a great
need for working people to organise to defend themselves. The
centralised, top-down trade unions we are accustomed to have proved
themselves incapable of effective struggle (and, indeed, the number of
times they have sabotaged such struggle are countless -- a result not of
"bad" leaders but of the way these unions organise and their role within
capitalism). Hence anarchists support industrial unionism as an
effective alternative to the malaise of official trade unionism. How
anarchists aim to encourage such new forms of workplace organisation and
struggle will be discussed in the [section J.5.4](secJ5.html#secj54).

One last point. We noted that many anarchists, particularly
communist-anarchists, consider unions, even anarchosyndicalist ones, as
having a strong reformist tendency (as discussed in [section
J.3.9](secJ3.html#secj39)). However, all anarchists recognise the
importance of autonomous class struggle and the need for organisations
to help fight that struggle. Thus anarchist-communists, instead of
trying to organise industrial unions, apply the ideas of industrial
unionism to workplace struggles. They would agree with the need to
organise all workers into a mass assembly and to have elected,
recallable administration committees to carry out the strikers wishes.
This means that while such anarchists do not call their practical ideas
"anarcho-syndicalism" nor the workplace assemblies they desire to create
"unions," there are **extremely** similar in nature and so we can
discuss both using the term "industrial unionism". The key difference is
that many (if not most) anarcho-communists consider that permanent
workplace organisations that aim to organise **all** workers would
become reformist. Because of this they also see the need for anarchist
to organise **as anarchists** in order to spread the anarchist message
within them and keep their revolutionary aspects at the forefront.

Spontaneously created organisations of workers in struggle play an
important role in both communist-anarchist and anarcho-syndicalist
theory. Since both advocate that it is the workers, using their own
organisations who will control their own struggles (and, eventually,
their own revolution) in their own interests, not a vanguard party of
elite political theorists, this is unsurprising. It matters little if
the specific organisations are revolutionary industrial unions, factory
committees, workers councils, or other labour formations. The important
thing is that they are created and run by workers themselves. Meanwhile,
anarchists are industrial guerrillas waging class war at the point of
production in order to win improvements in the here and now and
strengthen tendencies towards anarchism by showing that direct action
and libertarian organisation is effective and can win partial
expropriations of capitalist and state power. So while there are slight
differences in terminology and practice, all anarchists would support
the ideas of industrial organisation and struggle we have outlined
above.

J.5.3 What attitude do anarchists take to existing unions?
----------------------------------------------------------

As noted in the [last section](secJ5.html#secj52), anarchists desire to
create organisations in the workplace radically different from the
existing unions. The question now arises, what attitude do anarchists
take to trade unions?

Before answering that question, we must stress that anarchists, no
matter how hostile to trade unions as bureaucratic, reformist
institutions, **are** in favour of working class struggle. This means
that when trade union members or other workers are on strike anarchists
will support them (unless the strike is reactionary -- for example, no
anarchist would support a strike which is racist in nature). This is
because anarchists consider it basic to their politics that you do not
scab and you do not crawl. So, when reading anarchist criticisms of
trade unions do not for an instant think we do not support industrial
struggles -- we do, we are just very critical of the unions that are
sometimes involved.

So, what do anarchists think of the trade unions?

For the most part, one could call the typical anarchist opinion toward
them as one of "hostile support." It is hostile insofar as anarchists
are well aware of how bureaucratic these unions are and how they
continually betray their members. Given that they are usually little
more than "business" organisations, trying to sell their members
labour-power for the best deal possible, it is unsurprising that they
are bureaucratic and that the interests of the bureaucracy are at odds
with those of its membership. However, our attitude is "supportive" in
that even the worse trade union represents an attempt at working class
solidarity and self-help, even if the organisation is now far removed
from the initial protests and ideas that set the union up. For a worker
to join a trade union means recognising, to some degree, that he or she
has different interests from their boss (*"If the interests of labour
and capital are the same, why the union?"* [Alexander Berkman, **What is
Anarchism?**, p. 76]).

There is no way to explain the survival of unions other than the fact
that there are different class interests and workers have understood
that to promote their own interests they have to organise collectively.
No amount of conservatism, bureaucracy or backwardness within the unions
can obliterate this. The very existence of trade unions testifies to the
existence of some level of basic class consciousness and the recognition
that workers and capitalists do not have the same interests. Claims by
trade union officials that the interests of workers and bosses are the
same theoretically disarms both the union and its members and so weakens
their struggles (after all, if bosses and workers have similar interests
then any conflict is bad and the decisions of the boss must be in
workers' interests!). That kind of nonsense is best left to the
apologists of capitalism (see [section F.3.2](secF3.html#secf32)).

It is no surprise, then, the *"extreme opposition to the existing
political and economic power"* to unions as they *"not only suspected
every labour organisation of aiming to improve the condition of its
members within the limits of the wage system, but they also looked upon
the trade union as the deeply enemy of wage-slavery -- and they were
right. Every labour organisation of sincere character must needs wage
war upon the existing economic conditions, since the continuation of the
same is synonymous with the exploitation and enslavement of labour."*
[Max Baginski, *"Aim and Tactics of the Trade-Union Movement"*, pp.
297-306, **Anarchy! An Anthology of Emma Goldman's Mother Earth**, Peter
Glassgold (ed.), pp. 302-3] Thus anarchist viewpoints on this issue
reflect the contradictory nature of trade unions -- on the one hand they
are products of workers' struggle, but on the other they are
bureaucratic, unresponsive, centralised and their full-time officials
have no real interest in fighting against wage labour as it would put
them out of a job. Indeed, the very nature of trade unionism ensures
that the interests of the union (i.e. the full-time officials) come into
conflict with the people they claim to represent.

This can best be seen from the disgraceful activities of the TGWU with
respect to the Liverpool dockers in Britain. The union officials (and
the TUC itself) refused to support their members after they had been
sacked in 1995 for refusing to cross a picket line. The dockers
organised their own struggle, contacting dockers' unions across the
world and organised global solidarity actions. Moreover, a network of
support groups sprung up across Britain to gather funds for their
struggle (and, we are proud to note, anarchists have played their role
in supporting the strikers). Many trade unionists could tell similar
stories of betrayal by "their" union.

This occurs because trade unions, in order to get recognition from a
company, must be able to promise industrial peace. They need to enforce
the contracts they sign with the bosses, even if this goes against the
will of its members. Thus trade unions become a third force in industry,
somewhere between management and the workers and pursuing its own
interests. This need to enforce contracts soon ensures that the union
becomes top-down and centralised -- otherwise its members would violate
the unions agreements. They have to be able to control their members --
which usually means stopping them fighting the boss -- if they are to
have anything to bargain with at the negotiation table. This may sound
odd, but the point is that the union official has to sell the employer
labour discipline and freedom from unofficial strikes as part of its
side of the bargain otherwise the employer will ignore them.

The nature of trade unionism, then, is to take power away from out of
local members and centralise it into the hands of officials at the top
of the organisation. Thus union officials sell out their members because
of the role trade unions play within society, not because they are nasty
individuals (although some are). They behave as they do because they
have too much power and, being full-time and highly paid, are
unaccountable, in any real way, to their members. Power -- and wealth --
corrupts, no matter who you are (see *Chapter XI* of Alexander Berkman's
**What is Anarchism?** for an excellent introduction to anarchist
viewpoints on trade unions).

While, in normal times, most workers will not really question the nature
of the trade union bureaucracy, this changes when workers face some
threat. Then they are brought face to face with the fact that the trade
union has interests separate from theirs. Hence we see trade unions
agreeing to wage cuts, redundancies and so on -- after all, the
full-time trade union official's job is not on the line! But, of course,
while such a policy is in the short term interests of the officials, in
the longer term it goes against their interests -- who wants to join a
union which rolls over and presents no effective resistance to
employers? Little wonder Michael Moore had a chapter entitled *"Why are
Union Leaders So F\#!@ing Stupid?"* in his book **Downsize This!** --
essential reading on how moronic trade union bureaucrats can actually
be. Sadly trade union bureaucracy seems to afflict all who enter it with
short-sightedness -- although the chickens do, finally, come home to
roost, as the bureaucrats of the AFL, TUC and other trade unions are
finding out in this era of global capital and falling membership. So
while the activities of trade union leaders may seem crazy and
short-sighted, these activities are forced upon them by their position
and role within society -- which explains why they are so commonplace
and why even radical leaders end up doing exactly the same thing in
time.

However, few anarchists would call upon members of a trade union to
tear-up their membership cards. While some anarchists have nothing but
contempt (and rightly so) for trade unions (and so do not work within
them -- but will support trade union members in struggle), the majority
of anarchists take a more pragmatic viewpoint. If no alternative
syndicalist union exists, anarchists will work within the existing
unions (perhaps becoming shop-stewards -- few anarchists would agree to
be elected to positions above this in any trade union, particularly if
the post were full-time), spreading the anarchist message and trying to
create a libertarian undercurrent which would hopefully blossom into a
more anarchistic labour movement. So most anarchists "support" the trade
unions only until we have created a viable libertarian alternative. Thus
we will become trade union members while trying to spread anarchist
ideas within and outwith them. This means that anarchists are flexible
in terms of our activity in the unions. For example, many IWW members
were "two-carders" which meant they were also in the local AFL branch in
their place of work and turned to the IWW when the AFL hierarchy refused
to back strikes or other forms of direct action.

Anarchist activity within trade unions reflects our ideas on hierarchy
and its corrupting effects. We reject the response of left-wing social
democrats, Stalinists and mainstream Trotskyists to the problem of trade
union betrayal, which is to try and elect 'better' officials. They see
the problem primarily in terms of the individuals who hold the posts so
ignoring the fact that individuals are shaped by the environment they
live in and the role they play in society. Thus even the most left-wing
and progressive individual will become a bureaucrat if they are placed
within a bureaucracy.

We must note that the problem of corruption does not spring from the
high-wages officials are paid (although this is a factor), but from the
power they have over their members (which partly expresses itself in
high pay). Any claim that electing "radical" full-time officials who
refuse to take the high wages associated with the position will be
better is false. The hierarchical nature of the trade union structure
has to be changed, not side-effects of it. As the left has no problem
with hierarchy as such, this explains why they support this form of
"reform." They do not actually want to undercut whatever dependency the
members have on leadership, they want to replace the leaders with
"better" ones (i.e. themselves or members of their party) and so
endlessly call upon the trade union bureaucracy to act **for** its
members. In this way, they hope, trade unionists will see the need to
support a "better" leadership -- namely themselves. Anarchists, in stark
contrast, think that the problem is not that the leadership of the trade
unions is weak, right-wing or does not act but that the union's
membership follows them. Thus anarchists aim at undercutting reliance on
leaders (be they left or right) by encouraging self-activity by the rank
and file and awareness that hierarchical leadership as such is bad, not
individual leaders. Anarchists encourage rank and file self-activity,
**not** endless calls for trade union bureaucrats to act for us (as is
unfortunately far too common on the left).

Instead of "reform" from above (which is doomed to failure), anarchists
work at the bottom and attempt to empower the rank and file of the trade
unions. It is self-evident that the more power, initiative and control
that lies on the shop floor, the less the bureaucracy has. Thus
anarchists work within and outwith the trade unions in order to increase
the power of workers where it actually lies: at the point of production.
This is usually done by creating networks of activists who spread
anarchist ideas to their fellow workers (see [next
section](secJ5.html#secj54)). Hence Malatesta:

> *"The anarchists within the unions should strive to ensure that they
> remain open to all workers of whatever opinion or party on the sole
> condition that there is solidarity in the struggle against the bosses.
> They should oppose the corporatist spirit and any attempt to
> monopolise labour or organisation. They should prevent the Unions from
> becoming the tools of the politicians for electoral or other
> authoritarian ends; they should preach and practice direct action,
> decentralisation, autonomy and free initiative. They should strive to
> help members learn how to participate directly in the life of the
> organisation and to do without leaders and permanent officials.*

> *"They must, in short, remain anarchists, remain always in close touch
> with anarchists and remember that the workers' organisation is not the
> end but just one of the means, however important, of preparing the way
> for the achievement of anarchism."* [**The Anarchist Revolution**, pp.
> 26-7]

As part of this activity anarchists promote the ideas of Industrial
Unionism we highlighted in the [last section](secJ5.html#secj52) --
namely direct workers control of struggle via workplace assemblies and
recallable committees -- during times of struggle. However, anarchists
are aware that economic struggle (and trade unionism as such) *"cannot
be an end in itself, since the struggle must also be waged at a
political level to distinguish the role of the State."* [Malatesta,
**Errico Malatesta: His Life and Ideas**, p, 115] Thus, as well as
encouraging worker self-organisation and self-activity, anarchist groups
also seek to politicise struggles and those involved in them. Only this
process of self-activity and political discussion between equals
**within** social struggles can ensure the process of working class
self-liberation and the creation of new, more libertarian, forms of
workplace organisation.

The result of such activity may be a new form of workplace organisation
(either workplace assemblies or an anarcho-syndicalist union) or a
reformed, more democratic version of the existing trade union (although
few anarchists believe that the current trade unions can be reformed).
Either way, the aim is to get as many members of the current labour
movement to become anarchists as possible or, at the very least, take a
more libertarian and radical approach to their unions and workplace
struggle.

J.5.4 What are industrial networks?
-----------------------------------

Industrial networks are the means by which revolutionary industrial
unions and other forms of libertarian workplace organisation can be
created. The idea of Industrial Networks originated with the British
section of the anarcho-syndicalist **International Workers Association**
in the late 1980s. It was developed as a means of promoting libertarian
ideas within the workplace, so creating the basis on which a workplace
movement based upon the ideas of industrial unionism (see [section
J.5.2](secJ5.html#secj52)) could grow and expand.

The idea is very simple. An Industrial Network is a federation of
militants in a given industry who support the ideas of anarchism and/or
anarcho-syndicalism, namely direct action, solidarity and organisation
from the bottom up (the difference between purely anarchist networks and
anarcho-syndicalist ones will be highlighted later). It would
*"initially be a political grouping in the economic sphere, aiming to
build a less reactive but positive organisation within the industry. The
long term aim . . . is, obviously, the creation of an
anarcho-syndicalist union."* [**Winning the Class War**, p. 18]

The Industrial Network would be an organisation of groups of
libertarians within a workplace united on an industrial basis. They
would pull their resources together to fund a regular bulletin and other
forms of propaganda which they would distribute within their workplaces.
These bulletins and leaflets would raise and discuss issues related to
work, how to fight back and win as well as placing workplace issues in a
social and political context. This propaganda would present anarchist
ideas of workplace organisation and resistance as well as general
anarchist ideas and analysis. In this way anarchist ideas and tactics
would be able to get a wider hearing and anarchists can have an input
**as anarchists** into workplace struggles.

Traditionally, many syndicalists and anarcho-syndicalists advocated the
***One Big Union*** strategy, the aim of which was to organise all
workers into one organisation representing the whole working class.
Today, however, most anarcho-syndicalists, like other revolutionary
anarchists, advocate workers assemblies for decision making during
struggles which are open to all workers (union members or not) as they
recognise that they face dual unionism (which means there are more than
one union within a given workplace or country). This was the case,
historically, in all countries with a large syndicalist union movement
there were also socialist unions. Therefore most anarcho-syndicalists do
not expect to ever get a majority of the working class into a
revolutionary union before a revolutionary situation develops. In
addition, revolutionary unions do not simply appear, they develop from
previous struggles and require a lot of work and experience of which the
Industrial Networks are but one aspect. The most significant
revolutionary unions (such as the IWW, USI and CNT) were originally
formed by unions and union militants with substantial experience of
struggle behind them, some of whom were part of existing trade union
bodies.

Thus industrial networks are intended to deal with the actual situation
that confronts us, and provide a strategy for moving from our present
reality toward out ultimate goals. The role of the anarchist group or
syndicalist union would be to call workplace assemblies and their
federation into councils, argue for direct workers control of struggle
by these mass assemblies, promote direct action and solidarity, put
across anarchist ideas and politics and keep things on the boil, so to
speak. When one has only a handful of anarchists and syndicalists in a
workplace or scattered across several workplaces there is a clear need
for developing ways for these fellow workers to effectively act in
union, rather than be isolated and relegated to more general agitation.
A handful of anarchists cannot meaningfully call a general strike but we
can agitate around specific industrial issues and organise our fellow
workers to do something about them. Through such campaigns we
demonstrate the advantages of rank-and-file unionism and direct action,
show our fellow workers that our ideas are not mere abstract theory but
can be implemented here and now, attract new members and supporters, and
further develop our capacity to develop revolutionary unions in our
workplaces. Thus the creation of Industrial Networks and the calling for
workplace assemblies is a recognition of where we are now -- with
anarchist ideas very much in the minority. Calling for workers
assemblies is not an anarchist tactic per se, we must add, but a working
class one developed and used plenty of times by workers in struggle
(indeed, it was how the current trade unions were created). It also puts
the onus on the reformists unions by appealing directly to their members
as workers and exposing their bureaucrat organisations and reformist
politics by creating an effective alternative to them.

A few anarchists reject the idea of Industrial Networks and instead
support the idea of ***"rank and file"*** groups which aim to put
pressure on the current trade unions to become more militant and
democratic. Some even think that such groups can be used to reform the
trade-unions into libertarian, revolutionary organisations -- called
*"boring from within"* -- but most reject this as utopian, viewing the
trade union bureaucracy as unreformable as the state's (and it is likely
that rather than change the trade union, "boring from within" would
change the syndicalists by watering down their ideas). Moreover,
opponents of "rank and file" groups argue that they direct time and
energy **away** from practical and constructive activity and instead
waste them *"[b]y constantly arguing for changes to the union structure
. . . the need for the leadership to be more accountable, etc., [and so]
they not only [offer] false hope but [channel] energy and discontent
away from the real problem -- the social democratic nature of reformist
trade unions."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 11]

Supporters of the "rank and file" approach fear that the Industrial
Networks will isolate anarchists from the mass of trade union members by
creating tiny "pure" syndicalist groups. Such a claim is rejected by
supporters of Industrial Networks who argue that rather than being
isolated from the majority of trade unionists they would be in contact
with them where it counts, in the workplace and in struggle rather than
in trade union meetings which many workers do not even attend:

> *"We have no intention of isolating ourselves from the many workers
> who make up the rest of the rank and file membership of the unions. We
> recognise that a large proportion of trade union members are only
> nominally so as the main activity of social democratic unions is
> outside the workplace . . . **We aim to unite and not divide
> workers.***

> *"It has been argued that social democratic unions will not tolerate
> this kind of activity, and that we would be all expelled and thus
> isolated. So be it. We, however, don't think that this will happen
> until . . . workplace militants had found a voice independent of the
> trade unions and so they become less useful to us anyway. Our aim is
> not to support social democracy, but to show it up as irrelevant to
> the working class."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 19]

Whatever the merits and disadvantages of both approaches are, it seems
likely that the activity of both will overlap in practice with
Industrial Networks operating within trade union branches and "rank and
file" groups providing alternative structures for struggle.

As noted above, there is a slight difference between anarcho-syndicalist
supporters of Industrial Networks and communist-anarchist ones. This is
to do with how they see the function and aim of these networks. In the
short run, both agree that such networks should agitate in their
industry and call mass assemblies to organise resistance to capitalist
exploitation and oppression. They disagree on who can join the network
groups and what their medium term aims should be. Anarcho-syndicalists
aim for the Industrial Networks to be the focal point for the building
of permanent syndicalist unions and so aim for the Industrial Networks
to be open to all workers who accept the general aims of the
organisation. Anarcho-communists, however, view Industrial Networks as a
means of increasing anarchist ideas within the working class and are not
primarily concerned about building syndicalist unions (while many
anarcho-communists would support such a development, some do not). In
the long term, they both aim for social revolution and workers'
self-management of production.

These anarchists, therefore, see the need for workplace-based branches
of an anarchist group along with the need for networks of militant 'rank
and file' workers, but reject the idea of something that is one but
pretends to be the other. They argue that, far from avoiding the
problems of classical anarcho-syndicalism, such networks seem to
emphasise one of the worst problems -- namely that of how the
organisation remains anarchist but is open to non-anarchists. However,
the similarities between the two positions are greater than the
differences and so can be summarised together, as we have done here.

J.5.5 What forms of co-operative credit do anarchists support?
--------------------------------------------------------------

Anarchists tend to support must forms of co-operation, including those
associated with credit and money. This co-operative banking takes many
forms, such as credit unions, LETS schemes and so on. In this section we
discuss two main forms of co-operative credit, ***mutualism*** and
**LETS**.

Mutualism is the name for the ideas associated with Proudhon and his
**Bank of the People**. Essentially, it is a confederation of credit
unions in which working class people pool their funds and savings so
allowing credit to be supplied at cost (no interest), so increasing the
options available to them. LETS stands for **Local Exchange Trading
Schemes** and is a similar idea in many ways (see **Bringing the Economy
Home from the Market** by Ross V.G. Dobson on LETS). From its start in
Canada, LETS has spread across the world and there are now hundreds of
schemes involving hundreds of thousands of people.

Both schemes revolve around creating an alternative form of currency and
credit within capitalism in order to allow working class people to work
outwith the capitalist money system by creating a new circulating
medium. In this way, it is hoped, workers would be able to improve their
living and working conditions by having a source of community-based
(very low interest) credit and so be less dependent on capitalists and
the capitalist banking system. Supporters of mutualism considered it as
the ideal way of reforming capitalism away for by making credit
available to the ordinary worker at very cheap rates, the end of wage
slavery could occur as workers would work for themselves by either
purchasing the necessary tools required for their work or by buying the
capitalists out.

Mutual credit, in short, is a form of credit co-operation, in which
individuals pull their resources together in order to benefit themselves
as individuals and as part of a community. It has the following key
aspects:

> -- **Co-operation**: No-one owns the network. It is controlled by its
> members democratically.

> -- **Non-exploitative**: No interest is charged on account balances or
> credit. At most administrative costs are charged, a result of it being
> commonly owned and managed.

> -- **Consent**: Nothing happens without it, there is no compulsion to
> trade.

> -- **Labour-Notes**: They use their own type of money as a means of
> aiding "honest exchange."

It is hoped, by organising credit, working class people will be able to
work for themselves and slowly but surely replace capitalism with a
co-operative system based upon self-management. While LETS schemes do
not have such grand schemes, historically mutualism aimed at working
within and transforming capitalism to socialism. At the very least, LETS
schemes reduce the power and influence of banks and finance capital
within society as mutualism ensures that working people have a viable
alternative to such parasites.

These ideas have had a long history within the socialist movement,
originating in Britain in the early 19th century when Robert Owen and
other Socialists raised the idea of labour notes and labour-exchanges as
both a means of improving working class conditions within capitalism and
of reforming capitalism into a society of confederated, self-governing
communities. Such *"Equitable Labour Exchanges"* were *"founded at
London and Birmingham in 1832"* with *"Labour notes and the exchange of
small products."* [E. P. Thompson, **The Making of the English Working
Class**, p. 870] Apparently independently of these attempts in Britain
at what would later be called mutualism, Proudhon arrived at the same
ideas decades later in France: *"The People's Bank quite simply embodies
the financial and economic aspects of the principle of modern democracy,
that is, the sovereignty of the People, and of the republican motto,
'Liberty, Equality, Fraternity.'"* [**Selected Writings of P-J
Proudhon**, p. 75] Similarly, in the USA (partly as a result of Joshua
Warren's activities, who got the idea from Robert Owen) there was
extensive discussion on labour notes, exchanges and free credit as a
means of protecting workers from the evils of capitalism and ensuring
their independence and freedom from wage slavery. When Proudhon's works
appeared in North America, the basic arguments were well known and they
were quickly adopted by radicals there.

Therefore the idea that mutual banking using labour money as a means to
improve working class living conditions, even, perhaps, to achieve
industrial democracy, self-management and the end of capitalism has a
long history in Socialist thought. Unfortunately this aspect of
socialism became less important with the rise of Marxism (which called
these early socialists *"utopian"*). Attempts at such credit unions and
alternative exchange schemes were generally replaced with attempts to
build working class political parties and so constructive socialistic
experiments and collective working class self-help was replaced by
working within the capitalist state. Fortunately, history has had the
last laugh on Marxism with working class people yet again creating anew
the ideas of mutualism (as can be seen by the growth of LETS and other
schemes of community money).

J.5.6 Why are mutual credit schemes important?
----------------------------------------------

Mutual credit schemes are important because they are a way to improve
working class life under capitalism and ensure that what money we do
have is used to benefit ourselves rather than the elite. By organising
credit, we retain control over it and so rather than being used to
invest in capitalist schemes it can be used for socialist alternatives.

For example, rather than allow the poorest to be at the mercy of loan
sharks a community, by organising credit, can ensure its members receive
cheap credit. Rather than give capitalist banks bundles of cash to
invest in capitalist firms seeking to extract profits from a locality,
it can be used to fund a co-operative instead. Rather than invest
pension schemes into the stock market and so help undermine workers pay
and living standards by increasing rentier power, it can be used to
invest in schemes to improve the community and its economy. In short,
rather than bolster capitalist power and so control, mutual credit aims
to undermine the power of capitalist banks and finance by placing as
much money as much possible in working class hands.

This point is important, as the banking system is often considered
"neutral" (particularly in capitalist economics). However, as Malatesta
correctly argued, it would be *"a mistake to believe . . . that the
banks are, or are in the main, a means to facilitate exchange; they are
a means to speculate on exchange and currencies, to invest capital and
to make it produce interest, and to fulfil other typically capitalist
operations."* [**Errico Malatesta: His Life and Ideas**, p. 100] Within
capitalism, money is still to a large degree a commodity which is more
than a convenient measure of work done in the production of goods and
services. It can and does go anywhere in the world where it can get the
best return for its owners, and so it tends to drain out of those
communities that need it most (why else would a large company invest in
a community unless the money it takes out of the area handsomely exceeds
that put it?). It is the means by which capitalists can buy the liberty
of working people and get them to produce a surplus for them (wealth is,
after all, *"a power invested in certain individuals by the institutions
of society, to compel others to labour for their benefit."* [William
Godwin, **The Anarchist Writings of William Godwin**, p. 130]). From
this consideration alone, working class control of credit and money is
an important part of the class struggle as having access to alternative
sources of credit can increase working class options and power.

As we discussed in [section B.3.2](secB3.html#secb32), credit is also an
important form of social control -- people who have to pay their
mortgage or visa bill are more pliable, less likely to strike or make
other forms of political trouble. Credit also expands the consumption of
the masses in the face of stagnant or falling wages so blunting the
impact of increasing exploitation. Moreover, as an added bonus, there is
a profit to be made as the *"rich need a place to earn interest on their
surplus funds, and the rest of the population makes a juicy lending
target."* [Doug Henwood, **Wall Street**, p. 65]

Little wonder that the state (and the capitalists who run it) is so
concerned to keep control of money in its own hands or the hands of its
agents. With an increase in mutual credit, interest rates would drop,
wealth would stay more in working class communities, and the social
power of working people would increase (for people would be more likely
to struggle for higher wages and better conditions -- as the fear of
debt repayments would be less). By the creation of community-based
credit unions that do not put their money into "Capital Markets" or into
capitalist Banks working class people can control their own credit,
their own retirement funds, and find ways of using money as a means of
undermining capitalist power and supporting social struggle and change.
In this way working people are controlling more and more of the money
supply and using it in ways that will stop capital from using it to
oppress and exploit them.

An example of why this can be important can be seen from the existing
workers' pension fund system which is invested in the stock market in
the hope that workers will receive an adequate pension in their old age.
However, the only people actually winning are bankers and big companies.
Unsurprisingly, the managers of these pension fund companies are
investing in those firms with the highest returns, which are usually
those who are downsizing or extracting most surplus value from their
workforce (which in turn forces other companies to follow the same
strategies to get access to the available funds in order to survive).
Basically, if your money is used to downsize your fellow workers or
increase the power of capital, then you are not only helping to make
things harder for others like you, you are also helping making things
worse for yourself. No person is an island, and increasing the clout of
capital over the working class is going to affect you directly or
indirectly. As such, the whole scheme is counter-productive as it
effectively means workers have to experience insecurity, fear of
downsizing and stagnating wages during their working lives in order to
have slightly more money when they retire (assuming that they are
fortunate enough to retire when the stock market is doing well rather
than during one of its regular periods of financial instability, of
course).

This highlights one of the tricks the capitalists are using against us,
namely to get us to buy into the system through our fear of old age.
Whether it is going into lifelong debt to buy a home or putting our
money in the stock market, we are being encouraged to buy into the
system which exploits us and so put its interests above our own. This
makes us more easily controlled. We need to get away from living in fear
and stop allowing ourselves to be deceived into behaving like
"stakeholders" in a Plutocratic system where most shares really are held
by an elite. As can be seen from the use of pension funds to buy out
firms, increase the size of transnationals and downsize the workforce,
such "stakeholding" amounts to sacrificing both the present and the
future while others benefit.

The real enemies are **not** working people who take part in such
pension schemes. It is the people in power, those who manage the pension
schemes and companies, who are trying to squeeze every last penny out of
working people to finance higher profits and stock prices -- which the
unemployment and impoverishment of workers on a world-wide scale aids.
They control the governments of the world. They are making the "rules"
of the current system. Hence the importance of limiting the money they
have available, of creating community-based credit unions and mutual
risk insurance co-operatives to increase our control over our money
which can be used to empower ourselves, aid our struggles and create our
own alternatives (see [section B.3.2](secB3.html#secb32) for more
anarchist views on mutual credit and its uses). Money, representing as
it does the power of capital and the authority of the boss, is not
"neutral" and control over it plays a role in the class struggle. We
ignore such issues at our own peril.

J.5.7 Do most anarchists think mutual credit is sufficient to abolish capitalism?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The short answer is no, they do not. While the Individualist and
Mutualist Anarchists do think that mutual banking is the only sure way
of abolishing capitalism, most anarchists do not see it as an end in
itself. Few think that capitalism can be reformed away in the manner
assumed by Proudhon or Tucker.

In terms of the latter, increased access to credit does not address the
relations of production and market power which exist within the economy
and so any move for financial transformation has to be part of a broader
attack on all forms of capitalist social power in order to be both
useful and effective. In short, assuming that Individualist Anarchists
do manage to organise a mutual banking scheme it cannot be assumed that
as long as firms use wage-labour that any spurt in economic activity
will have a long term effect of eliminating exploitation. What is more
likely is that an economic crisis would develop as lowering unemployment
results in a profits squeeze (as occurred in, say, the 1970s). Without a
transformation in the relations of production, the net effect would be
the usual capitalist business cycle.

For the former, for mutualists like Proudhon, mutual credit **was** seen
as a means of transforming the relations of production (as discussed in
[section G.4.1](secG4.html#secg41), unlike Proudhon, Tucker did not
oppose wage-labour and just sought to make it non-exploitative). For
Proudhon, mutual credit was seen as the means by which co-operatives
could be created to end wage-labour. The organisation of labour would
combine with the organisation of credit to end capitalism as workers
would fund co-operative firms and their higher efficiency would soon
drive capitalist firms out of business. Thus *"the Exchange Bank is the
organisation of labour's greatest assetâ* as it allowed *"the new form
of society to be defined and created among the workers."* [Proudhon,
**Correspondance**, vol. 2, pp. 307-8] *"To organise credit and
circulation is to increase production,"* Proudhon stressed, *"to
determine the new shapes of industrial society."* [**Op. Cit.**, vol. 6,
p. 372] So, overtime, co-operative credit would produce co-operative
production while associated labour would increase the funds available to
associated credit. For Proudhon the *"organisation of credit and
organisation of labour amount to one and the same"* and by recognising
this the workers *"would soon have wrested alienated capital back again,
through their organisation and competition."* [**No Gods, No Masters**,
vol. 1, pp. 59-60]

Bakunin, while he was *"convinced that the co-operative will be the
preponderant form of social organisation in the future"* and could
*"hardly oppose the creation of co-operatives associations"* now as *we
find them necessary in many respects,"* argued that Proudhonâs hope for
gradual change by means of mutual banking and the higher efficiency of
workersâ co-operatives were unlikely to be realised. This was because
such claims *"do not take into account the vast advantage that the
bourgeoisie enjoys against the proletariat through its monopoly on
wealth, science, and secular custom, as well as through the approval --
overt or covert but always active -- of States and through the whole
organisation of modern society. The fight is too unequal for success
reasonably to be expected."* [**The Basic Bakunin**, p. 153 and p. 152]
Thus capitalism *"does not fear the competition of workers' associations
-- neither consumers', producers', nor mutual credit associations -- for
the simple reason that workers' organisations, left to their own
resources, will never be able to accumulate sufficiently strong
aggregations of capital capable of waging an effective struggle against
bourgeois capital."* [**The Political Philosophy of Bakunin**, p. 293]

So, for most anarchists, it is only in combination with other forms of
working class self-activity and self-management that mutualist
institutions could play an important role in the class struggle. In
other words, few anarchists think that mutualist credit or co-operatives
are enough in themselves to end capitalism. Revolutionary action is also
required -- such as the expropriation of capital by workers
associations.

This does not mean anarchists reject co-operation under capitalism. By
creating a network of mutual banks to aid in creating co-operatives,
union organising drives, supporting strikes (either directly by
gifts/loans or funding consumer co-operatives which could supply food
and other essentials free or at a reduced cost), mutualism can be used
as a means of helping build libertarian alternatives within the
capitalist system. Such alternatives, while making life better under the
current system, also play a role in overcoming that system by aiding
those in struggle. Thus Bakunin:

> *"let us co-operate in our common enterprise to make our lives a
> little bit more supportable and less difficult. Let us, wherever
> possible, establish producer-consumer co-operatives and mutual credit
> societies which, though under the present economic conditions they
> cannot in any real or adequate way free us, are nevertheless important
> inasmuch they train the workers in the practices of managing the
> economy and plant the precious seeds for the organisation of the
> future."* [**Bakunin on Anarchism**, p. 173]

So while few anarchists think that mutualism would be enough in itself,
it can play a role in the class struggle. As a compliment to direct
action and workplace and community struggle and organisation, mutualism
has an important role in working class self-liberation. For example,
community unions (see [section J.5.1](secJ5.html#secj51)) could create
their own mutual banks and money which could be used to fund
co-operatives and support social struggle. In this way a healthy
communalised co-operative sector could develop within capitalism,
overcoming the problems of isolation facing workplace co-operatives (see
[section J.5.11](secJ5.html#secj511)) as well as providing solidarity
for those in struggle.

Mutual banking can be a way of building upon and strengthening the
anarchistic social relations within capitalism. For even under
capitalism and statism, there exists extensive mutual aid and, indeed,
anarchistic and communistic ways of living. For example, communistic
arrangements exist within families, between friends and lovers and
within anarchist organisations. Mutual credit could be a means of
creating a bridge between this alternative (gift) "economy" and
capitalism. The mutualist alternative economy would help strength
communities and bonds of trust between individuals, and this would
increase the scope of the communistic sector as more and more people
help each other without the medium of exchange. In other words,
mutualism will help the gift economy that exists within capitalism to
grow and develop.

J.5.8 What would a modern system of mutual banking look like?
-------------------------------------------------------------

One scenario for an updated system of mutual banking would be for a
community to begin issuing an alternative currency accepted as money by
all individuals within it. Let us call this currency-issuing association
a "mutual barter clearinghouse," or just "clearinghouse" for short.

The clearinghouse would have a twofold mandate: first, to extend credit
at cost to members; second, to manage the circulation of credit-money
within the system, charging only a small service fee (one percent or
less) sufficient to cover its costs of operation, including labour costs
involved in issuing credit and keeping track of transactions, insuring
itself against losses from uncollectable debts, and so forth. Some
current experiments in community money use labour time worked as their
basis (thus notes would be marked one-hour) while others have notes tied
to the value of the state currency (thus, say, a Scottish town would
issue pounds assumed to be the same as a British pound note).

The clearinghouse would be organised and function as follows. People
could join the clearinghouse by pledging a certain amount of property
(including savings) as collateral. On the basis of this pledge, an
account would be opened for the new member and credited with a sum of
mutual pounds equivalent to some fraction of the assessed value of the
property pledged. The new member would agree to repay this amount plus
the service fee into their account by a certain date. The mutual pounds
could then be transferred through the clearinghouse to the accounts of
other members, who have agreed to receive mutual money in payment for
all debts or work done.

The opening of this sort of account is, of course, the same as taking
out a "loan" in the sense that a commercial bank "lends" by extending
credit to a borrower in return for a signed note pledging a certain
amount of property as security. The crucial difference is that the
clearinghouse does not purport to be "lending" a sum of money that it
**already has,** as is fraudulently claimed by commercial banks. Instead
it honestly admits that it is creating new money in the form of credit.
New accounts can also be opened simply by telling the clearinghouse that
one wants an account and then arranging with other people who already
have balances to transfer mutual money into one's account in exchange
for goods or services.

Another form of mutual credit are LETS systems. In this a number of
people get together to form an association. They create a unit of
exchange (which is equal in value to a unit of the national currency
usually), choose a name for it and offer each other goods and services
priced in these units. These offers and wants are listed in a directory
which is circulated periodically to members. Members decide who they
wish to trade with and how much trading they wish to do. When a
transaction is completed, this is acknowledged with a "cheque" made out
by the buyer and given to the seller. These are passed on to the system
accounts administration which keeps a record of all transactions and
periodically sends members a statement of their accounts. The accounts
administration is elected by, and accountable to, the membership and
information about balances is available to all members.

Unlike the first system described, members do not have to present
property as collateral. Members of a LETS scheme can go into "debt"
without it, although "debt" is the wrong word as members are not so much
going into debt as committing themselves to do some work within the
system in the future and by so doing they are creating spending power.
The willingness of members to incur such a commitment could be described
as a service to the community as others are free to use the units so
created to trade themselves. Indeed, the number of units in existence
exactly matches the amount of real wealth being exchanged. The system
only works if members are willing to spend. It runs on trust and builds
up trust as the system is used.

It is likely that a fully functioning mutual banking system would
incorporate aspects of both these systems. The need for collateral may
be used when members require very large loans while the LETS system of
negative credit as a commitment to future work would be the normal
function of the system. If the mutual bank agrees a maximum limit for
negative balances, it may agree to take collateral for transactions that
exceed this limit. However, it is obvious that any mutual banking system
will find the best means of working in the circumstances it finds
itself.

J.5.9 How does mutual credit work?
----------------------------------

Let us consider an example of how business would be transacted using
mutual credit within capitalism. There are two possibilities, depending
on whether the mutual credit is based upon whether the creditor can
provide collateral or not. We will take the case with collateral first.

Suppose that A, an organic farmer, pledges as collateral a certain plot
of land that she owns and on which she wishes to build a house. The land
is valued at, say, Â£40,000 in the capitalist market and by pledging the
land, A is able to open a credit account at the clearinghouse for, say,
Â£30,000 in mutual money. She does so knowing that there are many other
members of the system who are carpenters, electricians, plumbers,
hardware suppliers, and so on who are willing to accept mutual pounds in
payment for their products or services.

It is easy to see why other subscriber-members, who have also obtained
mutual credit and are therefore in debt to the clearinghouse, would be
willing to accept such notes in return for their goods and services.
They need to collect mutual currency to repay their debts. Why would
someone who is not in debt for mutual currency be willing to accept it
as money?

To see why, let us suppose that B, an underemployed carpenter, currently
has no account at the clearinghouse but that he knows about it and the
people who operate and use it. After examining its list of members and
becoming familiar with the policies of the new organisation, he is
convinced that it does not extend credit frivolously to untrustworthy
recipients who are likely to default. He also knows that if he contracts
to do the carpentry on A's new house and agrees to be paid for his work
in mutual money, he will then be able to use it to buy groceries,
clothes, and other goods and services from various people in the
community who already belong to the system.

Thus B will be willing, and perhaps even eager (especially if the
economy is in recession and regular money is tight) to work for A and
receive payment in mutual credit. For he knows that if he is paid, say,
Â£8,000 in mutual money for his labour on A's house, this payment
constitutes, in effect, 20 percent of a mortgage on her land, the value
of which is represented by her mutual credit. B also understands that A
has promised to repay this mortgage by producing new value -- that is,
by growing organic fruits and vegetables and selling them to other
members of the system -- and that it is this promise to produce new
wealth which gives her mutual credit its value as a medium of exchange.

To put this point slightly differently, A's mutual credit can be thought
of as a lien against goods or services which she will create in the
future. As security of this guarantee, she agrees that if she is unable
for some reason to fulfil her obligation, the land she has pledged will
be sold to other members. In this way, a value sufficient to cancel her
debt (and probably then some) will be returned to the system. This
provision insures that the clearinghouse is able to balance its books
and gives members confidence that mutual money is sound.

It should be noticed that since new wealth is continually being created,
the basis for new mutual credit is also being created at the same time.
Thus, suppose that after A's new house has been built, her daughter, C,
along with a group of friends D, E, F, . . . , decide that they want to
start a co-operative restaurant but that C and her friends do not have
enough collateral to obtain a start-up loan. A, however, is willing to
co-sign a note for them, pledging her new house (valued at say, Â£80,000)
as security. On this basis, C and her partners are able to obtain
Â£60,000 worth of mutual credit, which they then use to buy equipment,
supplies, furniture, advertising, etc. to start their restaurant.

This example illustrates one way in which people without property are
able to obtain credit in the new system. Another way -- for those who
cannot find (or perhaps do not wish to ask) someone with property to
co-sign for them -- is to make a down payment and then use the property
which is to be purchased on credit as security, as in the current method
of obtaining a home or other loan. With mutual credit, however, this
form of financing can be used to purchase anything, including the means
of production and other equipment required for workers to work for
themselves instead of a boss.

Which brings us to the case of an individual without means for providing
collateral -- say, for example Z, a plumber, who currently does not own
the land she uses. In such a case, Z, who still desires work done, would
contact other members of the mutual bank with the skills she requires.
Those members with the appropriate skills and who agree to work with her
commit themselves to do the required tasks. In return, Z gives them a
check in mutual dollars which is credited to their account and deducted
from hers. She does not pay interest on this issue of credit and the sum
only represents her willingness to do some work for other members of the
bank at some future date.

The mutual bank does not have to worry about the negative balance, as
this does not create a loss within the group as the minuses which have
been incurred have already created wealth (pluses) within the system and
it stays there. It is likely, of course, that the mutual bank would
agree an upper limit on negative balances and require some form of
collateral for credit greater than this limit, but for most exchanges
this would be unlikely to be relevant.

It is important to remember that mutual money has no **intrinsic**
value, since they cannot be redeemed (at the mutual bank) in gold or
anything else. All they are promises of future labour. They are a mere
medium for the facilitation of exchange used to facilitate the increase
production of goods and services (as discussed in [section
G.3.6](secG3.html#sech36), it is this increase which ensures that mutual
credit is not inflationary). This also ensures enough work for all and,
ultimately, the end of exploitation as working people can buy their own
means of production and so end wage-labour by self-employment and
co-operation.

For more information on how mutual banking is seen to work see the
collection of Proudhon's works collected in **Proudhon's Solution to the
Social Problem**. William B. Greene's **Mutual Baking** and Benjamin
Tucker's **Instead of a Book** should also be consulted.

J.5.10 Why do anarchists support co-operatives?
-----------------------------------------------

Support for co-operatives is a common feature in anarchist writings. In
fact, support for democratic workplaces is as old as use of the term
anarchist to describe our ideas. So why do anarchists support
co-operatives? It is because they are the only way to guarantee freedom
in production and so *"the co-operative system . . . carries within it
the germ of the future economic order."* [Bakunin, **The Philosophy of
Bakunin**, p. 385]

Anarchists support all kinds of co-operatives: housing, food, consumer,
credit and workplace ones. All forms of co-operation are useful as they
accustom their members to work together for their common benefit as well
as ensuring extensive experience in managing their own affairs. As such,
all forms of co-operatives are (to some degree) useful examples of
self-management and anarchy in action. Here we will concentrate on
producer co-operatives as only these can **replace** the capitalist mode
of production. They are examples of a new mode of production, one based
upon associated, not wage, labour. As long as wage-labour exists within
industry and agriculture then capitalism remains and no amount of other
kinds of co-operatives will end it. If wage slavery exists, then so will
exploitation and oppression and anarchy will remain but a hope.

Co-operatives are the *"germ of the future"* for two reasons. Firstly,
co-operatives are based on one worker, one vote. In other words those
who do the work manage the workplace within which they do it (i.e. they
are based on workers' self-management). Thus co-operatives are an
example of the "horizontal" directly democratic organisation that
anarchists support and so are an example of *"anarchy in action"* (even
if in an imperfect way) within capitalism. Secondly, they are an example
of working class self-help and self-activity. Instead of relying on
others to provide work, co-operatives show that production can be
carried on without the existence of a class of masters employing a class
of order takers.

Workplace co-operatives also present evidence of the viability of an
anarchist economy. It is well established that co-operatives are usually
more productive and efficient than their capitalist equivalents. This
indicates that hierarchical workplaces are **not** required in order to
produce useful goods and indeed can be harmful. It also indicates that
the capitalist market does not actually allocate resources efficiently
nor has any tendency to do so.

So why should co-operatives be more efficient? Firstly, there are the
positive effects of increased liberty. Co-operatives, by abolishing wage
slavery, obviously increase the liberty of those who work in them.
Members take an active part in the management of their working lives and
so authoritarian social relations are replaced by libertarian ones.
Unsurprisingly, this liberty also leads to an increase in productivity
-- just as wage labour is more productive than slavery, so associated
labour is more productive than wage slavery. As Kropotkin argued: *"the
only guarantee not to be robbed of the fruits of your labour is to
possess the instruments of labour . . . man really produces most when he
works in freedom, when he has a certain choice in his occupations, when
he has no overseer to impede him, and lastly, when he sees his work
bringing profit to him and to others who work like him, but bringing in
little to idlers."* [**The Conquest of Bread**, p. 145]

There are also the positive advantages associated with participation
(i.e. self-management, liberty in other words). Within a self-managed,
co-operative workplace, workers are directly involved in decision making
and so these decisions are enriched by the skills, experiences and ideas
of all members of the workplace. In the words of Colin Ward:

> "You can be **in** authority, or you can be **an** authority, or you
> can **have** authority. The first derives from your rank in some chain
> of command, the second derives special knowledge, and the third from
> special wisdom. But knowledge and wisdom are not distributed in order
> of rank, and they are no one person's monopoly in any undertaking. The
> fantastic inefficiency of any hierarchical organisation -- any
> factory, office, university, warehouse or hospital -- is the outcome
> of two almost invariable characteristics. One is that the knowledge

> in the decision-making leadership hierarchy of the institution.
> Frequently it is devoted to making the institution work in spite of

> they are there through economic necessity rather than through
> identification with a common task which throws up its own shifting and
> functional leadership.
>
> "Perhaps the greatest crime of the industrial system is the way it
> systematically thwarts the investing genius of the majority of its
> workers." [**Anarchy in Action**, p. 41]

Also, as workers also own their place of work, they have an interest in
developing the skills and abilities of their members and, obviously,
this also means that there are few conflicts within the workplace.
Unlike capitalist firms, there is no conflict between bosses and wage
slaves over work loads, conditions or the division of value created
between them. All these factors will increase the quality, quantity and
efficiency of work, increase efficient utilisation of available
resources and aids the introduction of new techniques and technologies.

Secondly, the increased efficiency of co-operatives results from the
benefits associated with co-operation itself. Not only does co-operation
increase the pool of knowledge and abilities available within the
workplace and enriches that source by communication and interaction, it
also ensures that the workforce are working together instead of
competing and so wasting time and energy. As Alfie Kohn notes (in
relation to investigations of in-firm co-operation):

> *"Dean Tjosvold . . . conducted [studies] at utility companies,
> manufacturing plants, engineering firms, and many other kinds of
> organisations. Over and over again, Tjosvold has found that
> 'co-operation makes a work force motivated' whereas 'serious
> competition undermines co-ordination' . . . Meanwhile, the management
> guru . . . T. Edwards Demming, has declared that the practice of
> having employees compete against each other is 'unfair [and]
> destructive. We cannot afford this nonsense any longer . . . [We need
> to] work together on company problems [but] annual rating of
> performance, incentive pay, [or] bonuses cannot live with team work .
> . . What takes the joy out of learning . . . [or out of] anything?
> Trying to be number one.'"* [**No Contest**, p. 240]

Thirdly, there are the benefits associated with increased equality.
Studies prove that business performance deteriorates when pay
differentials become excessive. In a study of over 100 businesses
(producing everything from kitchen appliances to truck axles),
researchers found that the greater the wage gap between managers and
workers, the lower their product's quality. [Douglas Cowherd and David
Levine, *"Product Quality and Pay Equity,"* **Administrative Science
Quarterly**, No. 37, pp. 302-30] Businesses with the greatest inequality
were plagued with a high employee turnover rate. Study author David
Levine said: *"These organisations weren't able to sustain a workplace
of people with shared goals."* [quoted by John Byrne, *"How high can CEO
pay go?"* **Business Week**, April 22, 1996] The negative effects of
income inequality can also be seen on a national level as well.
Economists Torsten Persson and Guido Tabellini conducted a thorough
statistical analysis of historical inequality and growth, and found that
nations with more equal incomes generally experience faster productive
growth. [*"Is Inequality Harmful for Growth?"*, **American Economic
Review** no. 84, pp. 600-21] Numerous other studies have also confirmed
their findings (the negative impacts on inequality on all aspects of
life are summarised by Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett in **The
Spirit Level: Why More Equal Societies Almost Always Do Better**). Real
life yet again disproves the assumptions of capitalism: inequality harms
us all, even the capitalist economy which produces it.

This is to be expected. Workers, seeing an increasing amount of the
value they create being monopolised by top managers and a wealthy elite
and not re-invested into the company to secure their employment
prospects, will hardly be inclined to put in that extra effort or care
about the quality of their work. Bosses who use the threat of
unemployment to extract more effort from their workforce are creating a
false economy. While they will postpone decreasing profits in the short
term due to this adaptive strategy (and enrich themselves in the
process) the pressures placed upon the system will bring harsh long term
effects -- both in terms of economic crisis (as income becomes so skewed
as to create realisation problems and the limits of adaptation are
reached in the face of international competition) and social breakdown.

As would be imagined, co-operative workplaces tend to be more
egalitarian than capitalist ones. This is because in capitalist firms,
the incomes of top management must be justified (in practice) to a small
number of individuals (namely, those shareholders with sizeable stock in
the firm), who are usually quite wealthy and so not only have little to
lose in granting huge salaries but are also predisposed to see top
managers as being very much like themselves and so are entitled to
comparable incomes (and let us not forget that *"corporate boards,
largely selected by the CEO, hire compensation experts, almost always
chosen by the CEO, to determine how much the CEO is worth."* [Paul
Krugman, **The Conscience of a Liberal**, p. 144]). In contrast, the
incomes of management in worker controlled firms have to be justified to
a workforce whose members experience the relationship between management
incomes and their own directly and who, no doubt, are predisposed to see
their elected managers as being workers like themselves and accountable
to them. Such an egalitarian atmosphere will have a positive impact on
production and efficiency as workers will see that the value they create
is not being accumulated by others but distributed according to work
actually done (and not control over power). In the Mondragon
co-operatives, for example, the maximum pay differential is 9 to 1
(increased from 3 to 1 after much debate in a response to outside
pressures from capitalist firms hiring away workers) while (in the USA)
the average CEO is paid well over 100 times the average worker (up from
41 times in 1960).

Therefore, we see that co-operatives prove the advantages of (and the
inter-relationship between) key anarchist principles such as liberty,
equality, solidarity and self-management. Their application, whether all
together or in part, has a positive impact on efficiency and work --
and, as we will discuss in [section J.5.12](secJ5.html#secj512), the
capitalist market actively **blocks** the spread of these more
egalitarian and efficient productive techniques instead of encouraging
them. Even by its own standards, capitalism stands condemned -- it does
not encourage the efficient use of resources and actively places
barriers in their development.

From all this it is clear to see why co-operatives are supported by
anarchists. We are *"convinced that the co-operative could, potentially,
replace capitalism and carries within it the seeds of economic
emancipation . . . The workers learn from this precious experience how
to organise and themselves conduct the economy without guardian angels,
the state or their former employers."* [Bakunin, **Bakunin on
Anarchism**, p. 399] Co-operatives give us a useful insight into the
possibilities of a free, socialist, economy. Even within the
hierarchical capitalist economy, co-operatives show us that a better
future is possible and that production can be organised in a
co-operative fashion and that by so doing we can reap the individual and
social benefits of working together as equals.

However, this does not mean that all aspects of the co-operative
movement find favour with anarchists. As Bakunin pointed out, *"there
are two kinds of co-operative: bourgeois co-operation, which tends to
create a privileged class, a sort of new collective bourgeoisie
organised into a stockholding society: and truly Socialist co-operation,
the co-operation of the future which for this very reason is virtually
impossible of realisation at present."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 385] In other
words, while co-operatives are the germ of the future, in the present
they are often limited by the capitalist environment they find
themselves, narrow their vision to just surviving within the current
system and so adapt to it.

For most anarchists, the experience of co-operatives has proven without
doubt that, however excellent in principle and useful in practice, if
they are kept within capitalism they cannot become the dominant mode of
production and free the masses (see [section
J.5.11](secJ5.html#secj511)). In order to fully develop, co-operatives
must be part of a wider social movement which includes community and
industrial unionism and the creation of a anarchistic social framework
which can encourage *"truly Socialist co-operation"* and discourage
*"bourgeois co-operation."* As Murray Bookchin correctly argued:
*"Removed from a libertarian municipalist [or other anarchist] context
and movement focused on achieving revolutionary municipalist goals as a
**dual power** against corporations and the state, food [and other forms
of] co-ops are little more than benign enterprises that capitalism and
the state can easily tolerate with no fear of challenge."* [**Democracy
and Nature**, no. 9, p. 175]

So while co-operatives are an important aspect of anarchist ideas and
practice, they are not the be all or end all of our activity. Without a
wider social movement which creates all (or at least most) of the future
society in the shell of the old, co-operatives will never arrest the
growth of capitalism or transcend the narrow horizons of the capitalist
economy.

J.5.11 If workers really want self-management then why are there so few co-operatives?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Supporters of capitalism suggest that producer co-operatives would
spring up spontaneously if workers really wanted them. To quote leading
propertarian Robert Nozick, under capitalism *"it is open to any wealthy
radical or group of workers to buy an existing factory or establish a
new one, and to . . . institute worker-controlled, democratically-run
firms."* If *"they are superior, by market standards, to their more
orthodox competitors"* then *"there should be little difficulty in
establishing successful factories of this sort."* Thus there is *"a
means of realising the worker-control scheme that can be brought about
by the voluntary actions of people in a free [sic!] society."*
[**Anarchy, State, and Utopia**, pp. 250-2] So if such co-operatives
were really economically viable and desired by workers, they would
spread until eventually they undermined capitalism. Propertarians
conclude that since this is not happening, it must be because workers'
self-management is either economically inefficient or is not really
attractive to workers, or both.

David Schweickart has decisively answered this argument by showing that
the reason there are not more producer co-operatives is structural:

> *"A worker-managed firm lacks an expansionary dynamic. When a
> capitalist enterprise is successful, the owner can increase her
> profits by reproducing her organisation on a larger scale. She lacks
> neither the means nor the motivation to expand. Not so with a
> worker-managed firm. Even if the workers have the means, they lack the
> incentive, because enterprise growth would bring in new workers with
> whom the increased proceeds would have to be shared. Co-operatives,
> even when prosperous, do not spontaneously grow. But if this is so,
> then each new co-operative venture (in a capitalist society) requires
> a new wealthy radical or a new group of affluent radical workers
> willing to experiment. Because such people doubtless are in short
> supply, it follows that the absence of a large and growing
> co-operative movement proves nothing about the viability of worker
> self-management, nor about the preferences of workers."* [**Against
> Capitalism**, p. 239]

This means that in, say, a mutualist economy there would be more firms
of a smaller size supplying a given market compared to capitalism. So a
free economy, with the appropriate institutional framework, need not
worry about unemployment for while individual co-operatives may not
expand as fast as capitalist firms, more co-operatives would be set up
(see [section I.3.1](secI3.html#seci31) for why the neo-classical
analysis of co-operatives which Nozick implicitly invokes is false). In
short, the environment within which a specific workplace operates is
just as important as its efficiency.

This is important, as the empirical evidence is strong that
self-management **is** more efficient than wage-slavery. As economist
Geoffrey M. Hodgson summarises, support for *"the proposition that
participatory and co-operatives firms enjoy greater productivity and
longevity comes from a large amount of . . . case study and econometric
evidence"* and *"the weight of testimony"* is *"in favour or [indicates]
a positive correlation between participation and productivity."*
[*"Organizational Form and Economic Evolution: A critique of the
Williamsonian hypothesis"*, pp. 98-115, **Democracy and Efficiency in
Economic Enterprises**, U. Pagano and R. E. Rowthorn (eds.), p. 100]
This is ignored by the likes of Nozick in favour of thought-experiments
rooted in the dubious assumptions of bourgeois economics. He implicitly
assumed that because most firms are hierarchical today then they must be
more efficient. In short, Nozick abused economic selection arguments by
simply assuming, without evidence, that the dominant form of
organisation is, *ipso facto*, more efficient. In reality, this is not
the case.

The question now becomes one of explaining why, if co-operation is more
efficient than wage-slavery, does economic liberty not displace
capitalism? The awkward fact is that individual efficiency is not the
key to survival as such an argument *"ignores the important point that
the selection of the 'fitter' in evolution is not simply relative to the
less successful but is dependent upon the general circumstances and
environment in which selection takes place."* Moreover, an organism
survives because it birth rate exceeds its death rate. If more
capitalist firms secure funding from capitalist banks then, obviously,
it is more likely for them to secure dominance in the economy simply
because there are more of them rather than because they are more
efficient. As such, large numbers do not imply greater efficiency as the
*"rapid flow of new entrants of hierarchical form"* may *"swamp the less
hierarchical firms even if other selection processes are working in
favour of the latter."* [Hodgson, **Op. Cit.**, p. 100 and p. 103] Thus:

> *"The degree of fitness of any organism can only be meaningfully
> considered in relation to its environment . . . the market may help to
> select firms that are fit for the market, but these surviving firms
> needn't be the most 'efficient' in some absolute sense. In fact, the
> specification of 'the market' as a selection process is incomplete
> because the market is only one institution of many needed to specify
> an environment."* [Michael J. Everett and Alanson P. Minkler,
> *"Evolution and organisational choice in nineteenth-century Britain"*,
> pp. 51-62, **Cambridge Journal of Economics** vol. 17, No. 1, p. 53]

As an obvious example there are the difficulties co-operatives can face
in finding access to credit facilities required by them from capitalist
banks and investors. As Tom Cahill notes, co-operatives in the
nineteenth century *"had the specific problem of . . . **giving
credit**"* while *"**competition with price cutting capitalist** firms .
. . highlighting the inadequate reservoirs of the under-financed
co-ops."* [*"Co-operatives and Anarchism: A contemporary Perspective"*,
pp 235-58, **For Anarchism**, Paul Goodway (ed.), p. 239] This points to
a general issue, namely that there are often difficulties for
co-operatives in raising money:

> *"Co-operatives in a capitalist environment are likely to have more
> difficulty in raising capital. Quite apart from ideological hostility
> (which may be significant), external investors will be reluctant to
> put their money into concerns over which they will have little or no
> control -- which tends to be the case with a co-operative. Because
> co-operatives in a capitalist environment face special difficulties,
> and because they lack the inherent expansionary dynamic of a
> capitalist firm, it is hardy surprising that they are far from
> dominant."* [Schweickart, **Op. Cit.**, p 240]

In addition, the *"return on capital is limited"* in co-operatives. [Tom
Cahill, **Op. Cit.**, p. 247] This means that investors are less-likely
to invest in co-operatives, and so co-operatives will tend to suffer
from a lack of investment. So despite *"the potential efficiency of such
[self-managed] workplaces"*, capitalism *"may be systematically biased
against participatory workplaces"* and as *"a result the economy can be
trapped in a socially suboptimal position."* Capital market issues,
amongst others, help explain this as such firms *"face higher
transaction costs for raising equity and loans."* [David I. Levine and
Laura D'Andrea Tyson, *"Participation, Productivity, and the Firm's
Environment"*, pp. 183-237, **Paying for Productivity**, Alan S. Blinder
(ed.), pp. 235-6 and p. 221]

Tom Cahill outlines the investment problem when he writes that the
*"financial problem"* is a major reason why co-operatives failed in the
past, for *"basically the unusual structure and aims of co-operatives
have always caused problems for the dominant sources of capital. In
general, the finance environment has been hostile to the emergence of
the co-operative spirit."* He also notes that they were *"unable to
devise structuring to **maintain a boundary** between those who work and
those who own or control . . . It is understood that when outside
investors were allowed to have power within the co-op structure, co-ops
lost their distinctive qualities."* [**Op. Cit.**, pp. 238-239] So even
**if** co-operative do attract investors, the cost of so doing may be to
transform the co-operatives into capitalist firms. So while all
investors experience risk, this *"is even more acute"* in co-operatives
*"because investors must simultaneously cede control **and** risk their
entire wealth. Under an unlimited liability rule, investors will
rationally demand some control over the firm's operations to protect
their wealth. Since [co-operatives] cannot cede control without
violating one of the organisation's defining tenets, investors will
demand an investment premium, a premium not required from equity
investments."* [Everett and Minkler, **Op. Cit.**, p. 52] Needless to
say, such a premium is a strain on a co-operative and makes it harder to
survive simply because it has higher costs for debt repayment. If such
external investment is not forthcoming, then the co-operative is
dependent on retained earnings and its members' savings which,
unsurprisingly, are often insufficient.

All of which suggests that Nozick's assertion that *"don't say that its
against the class interest of investors to support the growth of some
enterprise that if successful would end or diminish the investment
system. Investors are not so altruistic. They act in personal and not
their class interests"* is false. [**Op. Cit.**, pp. 252-3] Nozick is
correct, to a degree, but he forgets that class interest is a fusion of
individual interests. Given a choice between returns from investments in
capitalist firms because a management elite has similar interests in
maximising unpaid labour and workers in a co-operative which controls
any surplus, the investor will select the former. Moreover, lack of
control by investors plays its role as they cannot simply replace the
management in a co-operative -- that power lies in the hands of the
workforce. The higher premiums required by investors to forsake such
privileges place a burden on the co-operative, so reducing their
likelihood of getting funds in the first place or surviving and,
needless to say, increasing the risk that investors face. Thus the
personal and class interest of investors merge, with the personal desire
to make money ensuring that the class position of the individual is
secured. This does not reflect the productivity or efficiency of the
investment -- quite the reverse! -- it reflects the social function of
wage labour in maximising profits and returns on capital (see [next
section](secJ5.html#secj512) for more on this). In other words, the
personal interests of investors will generally support their class
interests (unsurprisingly, as class interests are not independent of
personal interests and will tend to reflect them!).

There are other structural problems as well. Co-operatives face the
negative externalities generated by the capitalist economy they operate
within. For one thing, since their pay levels are set by members'
democratic vote, co-operatives tend to be more egalitarian in their
income structure. This means that in a capitalist environment,
co-operatives are in constant danger of having their most skilled
members hired away by capitalist firms who can, due to their resources,
out-bid the co-operative. While this may result in exploitation of the
worker, the capitalist firm has the resources to pay higher wages and so
it makes sense for them to leave (*"As to the employer who pays an
engineer twenty times more than a labourer, it is simply due to personal
interest; if the engineer can economise \$4000 a year on the cost of
production; the employer pays him \$800 . . . He parts with an extra
\$40 when he expects to gain \$400 by it; and this is the essence of the
Capitalist system."* [Kropotkin, **The Conquest of Bread**, p. 165]).
However, in a co-operative system there would not be the inequalities of
economic wealth (created by capitalist firms and finance structures)
which allows such poaching to happen.

There are cultural issues as well. As Jon Elster points out, it is a
*"truism, but an important one, that workers' preferences are to a large
extent shaped by their economic environment. Specifically, there is a
tendency to adaptive preference formation, by which the actual mode of
economic organisation comes to be perceived as superior to all others."*
[*"From Here to There"*, pp. 93-111, **Socialism**, Paul, Miller Jr.,
Paul, and Greenberg (eds.), p. 110] In other words, people view "what
is" as given and feel no urge to change to "what could be." In the
context of creating alternatives within capitalism, this can have
serious effects on the spread of alternatives and indicates the
importance of anarchists encouraging the spirit of revolt to break down
this mental apathy.

This acceptance of "what is" can be seen, to some degree, by some
companies which meet the formal conditions for co-operatives, for
example ESOP owned firms in the USA, but lack effective workers'
control. ESOP (Employee Stock Ownership Plans) enable a firm's workforce
to gain the majority of a company's shares but the unequal distribution
of shares amongst employees prevents the great majority of workers from
having any effective control or influence on decisions. Unlike real
co-operatives (based on "one worker, one vote") these firms are based on
"one share, one vote" and so have more in common with capitalist firms
than co-operatives.

Finally, there is the question of history, of path dependency. Path
dependency is the term used to describe when the set of decisions one
faces for any given circumstance is limited by the decisions made in the
past, even though past circumstances may no longer be relevant. This is
often associated with the economics of technological change in a society
which depends quantitatively and/or qualitatively on its own past (the
most noted example this is the QWERTY keyboard, which would not be in
use today except that it happened to be chosen in the nineteenth
century). Evolutionary systems are path dependent, with historical
events pushing development in specific directions. Thus, if there were
barriers against or encouragement for certain forms of organisational
structure in the past then the legacy of this will continue to dominate
due to the weight of history rather than automatically being replaced by
new, more efficient, forms.

This can be seen from co-operatives, as *"labour managed firms were
originally at a substantial disadvantage compared to their capitalist
counterparts"* as the law *"imposed additional risks and costs"* on them
while *"early financial instruments were ill-suited to the establishment
and continuation of worker co-operatives. The subsequent coevolution of
firms and supporting institutions involved a path-dependent process
where labour-managed firms were at a continual disadvantage, even after
many of the earlier impediments were removed."* [Hodgson, **Op. Cit.**,
p. 103] *"Historically,"* argue Everett and Minkler *"both company and
co-operative law were incompatible with democratic decision-making by
workers."* The law ensured that the *"burden was more costly"* to
labour-managed firms and these *"obstacles led to an environment
dominated by investor-controlled firms (capitalist firms) in which
informal constraints (behaviours and routines) emerged to reinforce the
existing institutions. A path-dependent process incorporating these
informal constraints continued to exclude [their] widespread
formation."* When the formal constraints which prevented the formation
of co-operatives were finally removed, the *"informal constraints"*
produced as a result of these *"continued to prevent the widespread
formation"* of co-operatives. So the lack of co-operatives *"can thus be
explained quite independently of any of the usual efficiency criteria."*
[**Op. Cit.**, p. 58 and p. 60] Nor should we forget that the early
industrial system was influenced by the state, particularly by rewarding
war related contracts to hierarchical firms modelled on the military and
that the state rewarded contracts to run various state services and
industries to capitalist firms rather than, as Proudhon urged, to
workers associations.

However, *"there are several good reasons why more efficient firms need
not always be selected in a competitive and 'evolutionary' process."*
[Hodgson, **Op. Cit.**, p. 99] So it is not efficiency as such which
explains the domination of capitalist firms for *"empirical studies
suggest that co-operatives are at least as productive as their
capitalist counterparts,"* with many having *"an excellent record,
superior to conventionally organised firms over a long period."* [Jon
Elster, **Op. Cit.**, p. 96] So all things being equal, co-operatives
are more efficient than their capitalist counterparts -- but when
co-operatives compete in a capitalist economy, all things are **not**
equal. As David Schweickart argues:

> *"Even if worker-managed firms are preferred by the vast majority, and
> even if they are more productive, a market initially dominated by
> capitalist firms may not select for them. The common-sense
> neo-classical dictum that only those things that best accord with
> people's desires will survive the struggle of free competition has
> never been the whole truth with respect to anything; with respect to
> workplace organisation it is barely a half-truth."* [**Op. Cit.**, p.
> 240]

It is illuminating, though, to consider why Nozick ignored the
substantial empirical evidence that participation **is** more efficient
than hierarchy and, as a result, why *"market criteria"* does not result
in the more productive and efficient co-operative production displacing
the authoritarian workplace. Far better, it must be supposed, to just
assume that the dominant form of workplace is more "efficient" and
implicitly invoke a quasi-Darwinian individualistic selection mechanism
in an ahistorical and institution-less framework. So people like Nozick
who suggest that because worker co-operatives are few in number that
this means they are forced out by competition because they are
inefficient miss the point. A key reason for this lack of co-operative
firms, argues Hodgson, *"is that competitive selection depends on the
economic context, and while the institutional context of a capitalist
system may be more conducive for the capitalist firm, a different
context may favour the co-operative firm."* [**Economics and Utopia**,
p. 288]

As discussed in [section I.3.5](secI3.html#seci35), Proudhon was well
aware that for mutualism to prosper and survive an appropriate
institutional framework was required (the *"agro-industrial federation"*
and mutual banking). So an organisation's survival also depends on the
co-evolution of supporting informal constraints. If a co-operative is
isolated within a capitalist economy, without co-operative institutions
around it, it comes as no great surprise to discover that they find it
difficult to survive never mind displace its (usually larger and
well-established) capitalist competitors.

Yet in spite of these structural problems and the impact of previous
state interventions, co-operatives do exist under capitalism but just
because they can survive in such a harsh environment it does not
automatically mean that they shall **replace** that economy.
Co-operatives face pressures to adjust to the dominant mode of
production. The presence of wage labour and investment capital in the
wider economy will tempt successful co-operatives to hire workers or
issue shares to attract new investment. In so doing, however, they may
end up losing their identities as co-operatives by diluting ownership
(and so re-introducing exploitation by having to pay non-workers
interest) or by making the co-operative someone's boss (which creates
*"a new class of workers who exploit and profit from the labour of their
employees. And all this fosters a bourgeois mentality."* [Bakunin,
**Bakunin on Anarchism**, p. 399]).

Hence the pressures of working in a capitalist market may result in
co-operatives pursuing activities which may result in short term gain or
survival, but are sure to result in harm in the long run. Far from
co-operatives slowly expanding within and changing a capitalist
environment it is more likely that capitalist logic will expand into and
change the co-operatives that work in it (this can be seen from the
Mondragon co-operatives, where there has been a slight rise in the size
of wage labour being used and the fact that the credit union has, since
1992, invested in non-co-operative firms). These externalities imposed
upon isolated co-operatives within capitalism (which would not arise
within a fully co-operative context) block local moves towards
anarchism. The idea that co-operation will simply win out in competition
within well developed capitalist economic systems is just wishful
thinking. Just because a system is more liberatory, just and efficient
does not mean it will survive or prosper in an authoritarian economic
and social environment.

So both theory and history suggests that isolated co-operatives will
more likely adapt to capitalist realities than remain completely true to
their co-operative promise. For most anarchists, therefore,
co-operatives can reach their full potential only as part of a social
movement aiming to change society. Only as part of a wider movement of
community and workplace unionism, with mutualist banks to provide long
terms financial support and commitment, can co-operatives be
communalised into a network of solidarity and support that will reduce
the problems of isolation and adaptation. Hence Bakunin:

> *"We want co-operation too . . . But at the same time, we know that it
> prosper, developing itself fully and freely, embracing all human
> industry, only when it is based on equality, when all capital and
> every instrument of labour, including the soil, belong to the people
> by right of collective property . . . Once this is acknowledged we
> hardly oppose the creation of co-operative associations; we find them
> necessary in many respects . . . they accustom the workers to
> organise, pursue, and manage their interests themselves, without
> interference either by bourgeois capital or by bourgeois control . . .
> [they must be] founded on the principle of solidarity and collectivity
> rather than on bourgeois exclusivity, then society will pass from its
> present situation to one of equality and justice without too many
> great upheavals."* [**The Basic Bakunin**, p. 153]

Until then, co-operatives will exist within capitalism but not replace
it by market forces -- only a **social** movement and collective action
can fully secure their full development. This means that while
anarchists support, create and encourage co-operatives within
capitalism, we understand *"the impossibility of putting into practice
the co-operative system under the existing conditions of the
predominance of bourgeois capital in the process of production and
distribution of wealth."* Because of this, most anarchists stress the
need for more combative organisations such as industrial and community
unions and other bodies *"formed,"* to use Bakunin's words, *"for the
organisation of toilers against the privileged world"* in order to help
bring about a free society. [**The Political Philosophy of Bakunin**, p.
385]

Finally, we must note an irony with Nozick's argument, namely the notion
that capitalism (his *"free society"*) allows a *"voluntary"* path to
economic liberty. The irony is two-fold. First, the creation of
capitalism was the result of state action (see [section
F.8](secF8.html)). While working class people are expected to play by
the rules decreed by capitalism, capitalists have never felt the urge to
do so. It is this state coercion which helped create the path-dependency
which stops *"the market"* selecting more efficient and productive ways
of production. Secondly, Nozick's own theory of (property) rights denies
that stolen wealth can be legitimately transferred. In other words,
expecting workers to meekly accept previous coercion by seeking
investors to fund their attempts at economic liberty, as Nozick did, is
implicitly accepting that theft is property. While such intellectual
incoherence is to be expected from defenders of capitalism, it does mean
that propertarians really have no ground to oppose working class people
following the advice of libertarians and expropriating their workplaces.
In other words, transforming the environment and breaking the
path-dependency which stops economic liberty from flowering to its full
potential.

J.5.12 If self-management were more efficient then surely the market would force capitalists to introduce it?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some supporters of capitalism argue that if self-management really were
more efficient than hierarchy, then capitalists would be forced to
introduce it by the market. As propertarian Robert Nozick argued, if
workers' control meant that *"the productivity of the workers in a
factory **rises** . . . then the individual owners pursuing profits will
reorganise the productive process. If the productivity of workers
**remains the same** . . . then in the process of competing for
labourers firms will alter their internal work organisation."* This
meant that *"individual owners pursuing profits . . . will reorganise
the productive process."* [**Anarchy, State, and Utopia**, p. 248] As
this has not happened then self-management cannot be more efficient.

While such a notion seems plausible in theory, in practice it is flawed
as *"there is a vast quantity of empirical evidence demonstrating that
participatory workplaces tend to be places of higher morale and greater
productivity than authoritarian workplaces."* [David Schweickart ,
**Against Capitalism**, p. 228] So Nozick's thought experiment is
contradicted by reality. Capitalism places innumerable barriers to the
spread of worker empowering structures within production, in spite
(perhaps, as we will see, **because**) of their (well-documented) higher
efficiency and productivity. This can be seen from the fact that while
the increased efficiency associated with workers' participation and
self-management has attracted the attention of many capitalist firms,
the few experiments conducted have failed to spread even though they
were extremely successful. This is due to the nature of capitalist
production and the social relationships it produces.

As we noted in [section D.10](secD10.html), capitalist firms
(particularly in the west) made a point of introducing technologies and
management structures that aimed to deskill and disempower workers. In
this way, it was hoped to make the worker increasingly subject to
"market discipline" (i.e. easier to train, so increasing the pool of
workers available to replace any specific worker and so reducing workers
power by increasing management's power to fire them). Of course, what
actually happens is that after a short period of time while management
gained the upper hand, the workforce found newer and more effective ways
to fight back and assert their productive power again. While for a short
time the technological change worked, over the longer period the balance
of forces changed, so forcing management to continually try to empower
themselves at the expense of the workforce.

It is unsurprising that such attempts to reduce workers to order-takers
fail. Workers' experiences and help are required to ensure production
actually happens at all. When workers carry out their orders strictly
and faithfully (i.e. when they "work to rule") production stops. So most
capitalists are aware of the need to get workers to "co-operate" within
the workplace to some degree. A few capitalist companies have gone
further. Seeing the advantages of fully exploiting (and we do mean
exploiting) the experience, skills, abilities and thoughts of their
employers which the traditional authoritarian capitalist workplace
denies them, some have introduced various schemes to "enrich" and
"enlarge" work, increase "co-operation" between workers and their
bosses, to encourage workers to "participate" in their own exploitation
by introducing *"a modicum of influence, a strictly limited area of
decision-making power, a voice -- at best secondary -- in the control of
conditions of the workplace."* [Sam Dolgoff, **The Anarchist
Collectives**, p. 81] The management and owners still have the power and
still reap unpaid labour from the productive activity of the workforce.

David Noble provides a good summary of the problems associated with
experiments in workers' self-management within capitalist firms:

> *"Participation in such programs can indeed be a liberating and

> *"Fourth, such programs could provide management with a way to
> circumvent union rules and grievance procedures or eliminate unions
> altogether."* [**Forces of Production**, pp. 318-9]

Capitalist introduced and supported "workers' control" is very like the
situation when a worker receives stock in the company they work for. If
it goes a little way toward redressing the gap between the value
produced by that person's labour and the wage they receive for it, that
in itself cannot be a totally bad thing (although this does not address
the issue of workplace hierarchy and its social relations). The real
downside of this is the "carrot on a stick" enticement to work harder --
if you work extra hard for the company, your stock will be worth more.
Obviously, though, the bosses get rich off you, so the more you work,
the richer they get, the more you are getting ripped off. It is a choice
that anarchists feel many workers cannot afford to make -- they need or
at least want the money -- but we believe that it does not work as
workers simply end up working harder, for less. After all, stocks do not
represent all profits (large amounts of which end up in the hands of top
management) nor are they divided just among those who labour. Moreover,
workers may be less inclined to take direct action, for fear that they
will damage the value of "their" company's stock, and so they may find
themselves putting up with longer, more intense work in worse
conditions.

Be that as it may, the results of such capitalist experiments in
"workers' control" are interesting and show **why** self-management will
not spread by market forces. According to one expert: *"There is
scarcely a study in the entire literature which fails to demonstrate
that satisfaction in work is enhanced or . . .productivity increases
occur from a genuine increase in worker's decision-making power.
Findings of such consistency . . . are rare in social research."* [Paul
B. Lumberg, quoted by Herbert Gintis, *"The nature of Labour Exchange
and the Theory of Capitalist Production"*, **Radical Political
Economy**, vol. 1, Samuel Bowles and Richard Edwards (eds.), p. 252] In
spite of these findings, a *"shift toward participatory relationships is
scarcely apparent in capitalist production"* and this is *"not
compatible with the neo-classical assertion as to the efficiency of the
internal organisation of capitalist production."* [Gintz, **Op. Cit.**,
p. 252] Economist William Lazonick indicates the reason when he writes
that *"[m]any attempts at job enrichment and job enlargement in the
first half of the 1970s resulted in the supply of more and better effort
by workers. Yet many 'successful' experiments were cut short when the
workers whose work had been enriched and enlarged began questioning
traditional management prerogatives inherent in the existing
hierarchical structure of the enterprise."* [**Competitive Advantage on
the Shop Floor**, p. 282]

This is an important result, as it indicates that the ruling sections
within capitalist firms have a vested interest in **not** introducing
such schemes, even though they are more efficient methods of production.
As can easily be imagined, managers have a clear incentive to resist
participatory schemes (as David Schweickart notes, such resistance,
*"often bordering on sabotage, is well known and widely documented"*
[**Op. Cit.**, p. 229]). As an example of this David Noble discusses a
scheme ran by General Electric in the late 1960s:

> *"After considerable conflict, GE introduced a quality of work life
> program . . . which gave workers much more control over the machines
> and the production process and eliminated foremen. Before long, by all
> indicators, the program was succeeding -- machine use, output and
> product quality went up; scrap rate, machine downtime, worker
> absenteeism and turnover when down, and conflict on the floor dropped
> off considerably. Yet, little more than a year into the program --
> following a union demand that it be extended throughout the shop and
> into other GE locations -- top management abolished the program out of
> fear of losing control over the workforce. Clearly, the company was
> willing to sacrifice gains in technical and economic efficiency in
> order to regain and insure management control."* [**Progress Without
> People**, p. 65f]

Simply put, managers and capitalists can see that workers' control
experiments expose the awkward fact that they are not needed, that their
role is not related to organising production but exploiting workers.
They have no urge to introduce reforms which will ultimately make
themselves redundant. Moreover, most enjoy the power that comes with
their position and have no desire to see it ended. This also places a
large barrier in the way of workers' control. Interestingly, this same
mentality explains why capitalists often support fascist regimes: *"The
anarchist Luigi Fabbri termed fascism a **preventative
counter-revolution**; but in his essay he makes the important point that
the employers, particularly in agriculture, were not so much moved by
fear of a general revolution as by the erosion of their own authority
and property rights which had already taken place locally: 'The bosses
felt they were no longer bosses.'"* [Adrian Lyttelton, *"Italian
Fascism"*, pp. 81-114, **Fascism: a Reader's Guide**, p. 91]

However, it could be claimed that owners of stock, being concerned by
the bottom-line of profits, could **force** management to introduce
participation. By this method, competitive market forces would
ultimately prevail as individual owners, pursuing profits, reorganise
production and participation spreads across the economy. Indeed, there
are a few firms that **have** introduced such schemes but there has been
no tendency for them to spread. This contradicts "free market"
capitalist economic theory which states that those firms which introduce
more efficient techniques will prosper and competitive market forces
will ensure that other firms will introduce the technique.

This has not happened for three reasons.

Firstly, the fact is that within "free market" capitalism **keeping**
(indeed strengthening) skills and power in the hands of the workers
makes it harder for a capitalist firm to maximise profits (i.e. unpaid
labour). It strengthens the power of workers, who can use that power to
gain increased wages (i.e. reduce the amount of surplus value they
produce for their bosses). Workers' control also leads to a usurpation
of capitalist prerogatives -- including their share of revenues and
their ability to extract more unpaid labour during the working day.
While in the short run workers' control may lead to higher productivity
(and so may be toyed with), in the long run, it leads to difficulties
for capitalists to maximise their profits:

> *"given that profits depend on the integrity of the labour exchange, a
> strongly centralised structure of control not only serves the
> interests of the employer, but dictates a minute division of labour
> irrespective of considerations of productivity. For this reason, the
> evidence for the superior productivity of 'workers control' represents
> the most dramatic of anomalies to the neo-classical theory of the
> firm: worker control increases the effective amount of work elicited
> from each worker and improves the co-ordination of work activities,
> while increasing the solidarity and delegitimising the hierarchical
> structure of ultimate authority at its root; hence it threatens to
> increase the power of workers in the struggle over the share of total
> value."* [Gintz, **Op. Cit.**, p. 264]

A workplace which had extensive workers participation would hardly see
the workers agreeing to reduce their skill levels, take a pay cut or
increase their pace of work simply to enhance the profits of
capitalists. Simply put, profit maximisation is not equivalent to
efficiency. Getting workers to work longer, more intensely or in more
unpleasant conditions can increase profits but it does not yield more
output for the **same** inputs. Workers' control would curtail
capitalist means of enhancing profits by changing the quality and
quantity of work. It is **this** requirement which also aids in
understanding why capitalists will not support workers' control -- even
though it is more efficient, it reduces capitalist power in production.
Moreover, demands to change the nature of workers' inputs into the
production process in order to maximise profits for capitalists would
provoke a struggle over the intensity of work, working hours, and over
the share of value added going to workers, management and owners and so
destroy the benefits of participation.

Thus power within the workplace plays a key role in explaining why
workers' control does not spread -- it reduces the ability of bosses to
extract more unpaid labour from workers.

The second reason is related to the first. It too is based on the power
structure within the company but the power is related to control over
the surplus produced by the workers rather than the ability to control
how much surplus is produced in the first place (i.e. power over
workers). Hierarchical management is the way to ensure that profits are
channelled into the hands of a few. By centralising power, the surplus
value produced by workers can be distributed in a way which benefits
those at the top (i.e. management and capitalists). This explains the
strange paradox of workers' control experiments being successful but
being cancelled by management. This is easily explained once the
hierarchical nature of capitalist production (i.e. of wage labour) is
acknowledged. Workers' control, by placing (some) power in the hands of
workers, undermines the authority of management and, ultimately, their
power to control the surplus produced by workers and allocate it as they
see fit. Thus, while workers' control does reduce costs, increase
efficiency and productivity (i.e. maximise the difference between prices
and costs) it (potentially) reduces the power of management and owners
to allocate that surplus as they see fit. Indeed, it can be argued that
hierarchical control of production exists solely to provide for the
accumulation of capital in a few hands, **not** for efficiency or
productivity (see Stephan A. Margin, *"What do Bosses do? The Origins
and Functions of Hierarchy in Capitalist Production"*, **Op. Cit.**, pp.
178-248).

As David Noble argues, power is the key to understanding capitalism,
**not** the drive for profits as such:

> *"In opting for control [over the increased efficiency of workers'
> control] . . . management . . . knowingly and, it must be assumed,
> willingly, sacrificed profitable production. . . . [This] illustrates

Hierarchical organisation (domination) is essential to ensure that
profits are controlled by a few and can, therefore, be allocated by them
in such a way to ensure their power and privileges. By undermining such
authority, workers' control also undermines that power to maximise
profits in a certain direction even though it increases "profits" (the
difference between prices and costs) in the abstract. As workers'
control starts to extend (or management sees its potential to spread)
into wider areas such as investment decisions, how to allocate the
surplus (i.e. profits) between wages, investment, dividends, management
pay and so on, then they will seek to end the project in order to ensure
their power over both the workers and the surplus they, the workers,
produce (this is, of course, related to the issue of lack of control by
investors in co-operatives raised in the [last
section](secJ5.html#secj511)).

As such, the opposition by managers to workers' control will be
reflected by those who actually own the company who obviously would not
support a regime which will not ensure the maximum return on their
investment. This would be endangered by workers' control, even though it
is more efficient and productive, as control over the surplus rests with
the workers and not a management elite with similar interests and aims
as the owners -- an egalitarian workplace would produce an egalitarian
distribution of surplus, in other words (as proven by the experience of
workers' co-operatives). In the words of one participant of the GE
workers' control project: *"If we're all one, for manufacturing reasons,
we must share in the fruits equitably, just like a co-op business."*
[quoted by Noble, **Op. Cit.**, p. 295] Such a possibility is one few
owners would agree to.

Thirdly, to survive within the "free" market means to concentrate on the
short term. Long terms benefits, although greater, are irrelevant. A
free market requires profits **now** and so a firm is under considerable
pressure to maximise short-term profits by market forces. Participation
requires trust, investment in people and technology and a willingness to
share the increased value added that result from workers' participation
with the workers who made it possible. All these factors would eat into
short term profits in order to return richer rewards in the future.
Encouraging participation thus tends to increase long term gains at the
expense of short-term ones (to ensure that workers do not consider
participation as a con, they must experience **real** benefits in terms
of power, conditions and wage rises). For firms within a free market
environment, they are under pressure from share-holders and their
financiers for high returns as soon as possible. If a company does not
produce high dividends then it will see its stock fall as shareholders
move to those companies that do. Thus the market **forces** companies to
act in such ways as to maximise short term profits.

If faced with a competitor which is not making such investments (and
which is investing directly into deskilling technology or intensifying
work loads which lowers their costs) and so wins them market share, or a
downturn in the business cycle which shrinks their profit margins and
makes it difficult for the firm to meet its commitments to its
financiers and workers, a company that intends to invest in people and
trust will usually be rendered unable to do so. Faced with the option of
empowering people in work or deskilling them and/or using the fear of
unemployment to get workers to work harder and follow orders, capitalist
firms have consistently chosen (and probably preferred) the latter
option (as occurred in the 1970s).

Thus, workers' control is unlikely to spread through capitalism because
it entails a level of working class consciousness and power that is
incompatible with capitalist control: *"If the hierarchical division of
labour is necessary for the extraction of surplus value, then worker
preferences for jobs threatening capitalist control will not be
implemented."* [Gintis, **Op. Cit.**, p. 253] The reason why it is more
efficient, ironically, ensures that a capitalist economy will not select
it. The "free market" will discourage empowerment and democratic
workplaces, at best reducing "co-operation" and "participation" to
marginal issues (and management will still have the power of veto).

The failure of moves towards democratic workplaces within capitalism are
an example of that system in conflict with itself -- pursuing its
objectives by methods which constantly defeat those same objectives. As
Paul Carden argued, the *"capitalist system can only maintain itself by
trying to reduce workers into mere order-takers . . . At the same time
the system can only function as long as this reduction is never achieved
. . . [for] the system would soon grind to a halt . . . [However]
capitalism constantly has to **limit** this **participation** (if it
didn't the workers would soon start deciding themselves and would show
in practice now superfluous the ruling class really is)."* [**Modern
Capitalism and Revolution**, pp. 45-46] Thus "workers' control" within a
capitalist firm is a contradictory thing -- too little power and it is
meaningless, too much and workplace authority structures and capitalist
share of, and control over, value added can be harmed. Attempts to make
oppressed, exploited and alienated workers work if they were neither
oppressed, exploited nor alienated will always fail.

For a firm to establish committed and participatory relations
internally, it must have external supports -- particularly with
providers of finance (which is why co-operatives benefit from credit
unions and co-operating together). The price mechanism proves
self-defeating to create such supports and that is why we see
"participation" more fully developed within Japanese and German firms
(although it is still along way from fully democratic workplaces), who
have strong, long term relationships with local banks and the state
which provides them with the support required for such activities. As
William Lazonick notes, Japanese industry had benefited from the state
ensuring *"access to inexpensive long-term finance, the sine qua non of
innovating investment strategies"* along with a host of other supports,
such as protecting Japanese industry within their home markets so they
could *"develop and utilise their productive resources to the point
where they could attain competitive advantage in international
competition."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 305] The German state provides its
industry with much of the same support.

Therefore, "participation" within capitalist firms will have little or
no tendency to spread due to the actions of market forces. In spite of
such schemes almost always being more efficient, capitalism will not
select them because they empower workers and make it hard for
capitalists to generate and control their profits. Hence capitalism, by
itself, will have no tendency to produce more libertarian organisational
forms within industry. Those firms that do introduce such schemes will
be the exception rather than the rule (and the schemes themselves will
be marginal in most respects and subject to veto from above). For such
schemes to spread, collective action is required (such as state
intervention to create the right environment and support network or --
from an anarchist point of view -- union and community direct action).

Such schemes, as noted above, are just forms of self-exploitation,
getting workers to help their robbers and so **not** a development
anarchists seek to encourage. We have discussed this here just to be
clear that, firstly, such forms of structural reforms are **not**
self-management, as managers and owners still have the real power, and,
secondly, even if such forms are somewhat liberatory and more efficient,
market forces will not select them precisely **because** the latter is
dependent on the former. Thirdly, they would still be organised for
exploitation as workers would not be controlling all the goods they
produced. As with an existing capitalist firm, part of their product
would be used to pay interest, rent and profit. For anarchists
*"self-management is not a new form of mediation between workers and
their bosses . . . [it] refers to the very process by which the workers
themselves **overthrow** their managers and take on their own management
and the management of production in their own workplace."* [Dolgoff,
**Op. Cit.**, p. 81] Hence our support for co-operatives, unions and
other self-managed structures created and organised from below by and
for working class people by their own collective action.

J.5.13 What are Modern Schools?
-------------------------------

Modern schools are alternative schools, self-managed by students,
teachers and parents which reject the authoritarian schooling methods of
the modern "education" system. Such schools have been a feature of the
anarchist movement since the turn of the 20th century while interest in
libertarian forms of education has existed in anarchist theory from the
beginning. All the major anarchist thinkers, from Godwin through
Proudhon, Bakunin and Kropotkin to modern activists like Colin Ward,
have stressed the importance of libertarian (or rational) education,
education that develops all aspects of the student (mental and physical
-- and so termed integral education) as well as encouraging critical
thought and mental freedom. The aim of such education is ensure that the
*"industrial worker, the man [sic!] of action and the intellectual would
all be rolled into one."* [Proudhon, quoted by Steward Edward, **The
Paris Commune**, p. 274]

Anyone involved in radical politics, constantly and consistently
challenges the role of the state's institutions and their
representatives within our lives. The role of bosses, the police, social
workers, the secret service, managers, doctors and priests are all seen
as part of a hierarchy which exists to keep us, the working class,
subdued. It is relatively rare, though, for the left-wing to call into
question the role of teachers. Most left wing activists and a large
number of libertarians believe that education is always good.

Those involved in libertarian education believe the contrary. They
believe that national education systems exist only to produce citizens
who will be blindly obedient to the dictates of the state, citizens who
will uphold the authority of government even when it runs counter to
personal interest and reason, wage slaves who will obey the orders of
their boss most of the time and consider being able to change bosses as
freedom. They agree with William Godwin (one of the earliest critics of
national education systems) when he wrote that *"the project of a
national education ought to be discouraged on account of its obvious
alliance with national government . . . Government will not fail to
employ it to strengthen its hand and perpetuate its institutions . . .
Their views as instigator of a system will not fail to be analogous to
their views in their political capacity."* [quoted by Colin Ward,
**Anarchy in Action**, p. 81]

With the growth of industrialism in the 19th century state schools
triumphed, not through a desire to reform but as an economic necessity.
Industry did not want free thinking individuals, it wanted workers,
instruments of labour, and it wanted them punctual, obedient, passive
and willing to accept their disadvantaged position. According to Nigel
Thrift, many employers and social reformers became convinced that the
earliest generations of workers were almost impossible to discipline
(i.e. to get accustomed to wage labour and workplace authority). They
looked to children, hoping that *"the elementary school could be used to
break the labouring classes into those habits of work discipline now
necessary for factory production . . . Putting little children to work
at school for very long hours at very dull subjects was seen as a
positive virtue, for it made them habituated, not to say naturalised, to
labour and fatigue."* [quoted by Juliet B. Schor, **The Overworked
American**, p. 61]

Thus supporters of Modern Schools recognise that the role of education
is an important one in maintaining hierarchical society -- for
government and other forms of hierarchy (such as wage labour) must
always depend on the opinion of the governed. Francisco Ferrer (the most
famous libertarian educator) argued that:

> *"Rulers have always taken care to control the education of the
> people. They know their power is based almost entirely on the school
> and they insist on retaining their monopoly. The school is an
> instrument of domination in the hands of the ruling class."* [quoted
> by Clifford Harper, **Anarchy: A Graphic Guide**, p. 100]

Little wonder, then, that Emma Goldman argued that *"modern methods of
education"* have *"little regard for personal liberty and originality of
thought. Uniformity and imitation is [its] motto."* The school *"is for
the child what the prison is for the convict and the barracks for the
solder -- a place where everything is being used to break the will of
the child, and then to pound, knead, and shape it into a being utterly
foreign to itself."* Hence the importance of Modern Schools. It is a
means of spreading libertarian education within a hierarchical society
and undercut one of the key supports for that society -- the education
system. Instead of hierarchical education, Modern schools exist to
*"develop the individual through knowledge and the free play of
characteristic traits, so that [the child] may become a social being,
because he had learned to know himself, to know his relation to his
fellow[s]."* [**Red Emma Speaks**, pp. 141-2, p. 140 and p. 145] It
would be an education for freedom, not for subservience:

> *"Should the notion of freedom but awaken in man, free men dream only
> of freeing themselves now and for all time: but instead, all we do is
> churn out learned men who adapt in the most refined manner to every
> circumstance and fall to the level of slavish, submissive souls. For
> the most part, what are our fine gentlemen brimful of intellect and
> culture? Sneering slavers and slaves themselves."* [Max Stirner, **No
> Gods, No Masters**, vol. 1, p. 12]

The Modern School Movement (also known as the Free School Movement) over
the past century has been an attempt to represent part of this concern
about the dangers of state and church schools and the need for
libertarian education. The idea of libertarian education is that
knowledge and learning should be linked to real life processes as well
as personal usefulness and should not be the preserve of a special
institution. Thus Modern Schools are an attempt to establish an
environment for self development in an overly structured and
rationalised world. An oasis from authoritarian control and as a means
of passing on the knowledge to be free:

> *"The underlying principle of the Modern School is this: education is
> a process of drawing out, not driving in; it aims at the possibility
> that the child should be left free to develop spontaneously, directing
> his own efforts and choosing the branches of knowledge which he
> desires to study . . . the teacher . . . should be a sensitive
> instrument responding to the needs of the child . . . a channel
> through which the child may attain so much of the ordered knowledge of
> the world as he shows himself ready to receive and assimilate."*
> [Goldman, **Op. Cit.**, p. 146]

The Modern School bases itself on libertarian education techniques.
Libertarian education, very broadly, seeks to produce children who will
demand greater personal control and choice, who think for themselves and
question all forms of authority:

> *"We don't hesitate to say we want people who will continue to
> develop. People constantly capable of destroying and renewing their
> surroundings and themselves: whose intellectual independence is their
> supreme power, which they will yield to none; always disposed for
> better things, eager for the triumph of new ideas, anxious to crowd
> many lives into the life they have. It must be the aim of the school
> to show the children that there will be tyranny as long as one person
> depends on another."* [Ferrer, quoted by Harper, **Op. Cit.**, p. 100]

Thus the Modern School insists that the child is the centre of gravity
in the education process -- and that education is just that, **not**
indoctrination:

> *"I want to form a school of emancipation, concerned with banning from
> the mind whatever divides people, the false concepts of property,
> country and family so as to attain the liberty and well-being which
> all desire. I will teach only simple truth. I will not ram dogma into
> their heads. I will not conceal one iota of fact. I will teach not
> what to think but how to think."* [Ferrer, quoted by Harper, **Op.
> Cit.**, pp. 99-100]

The Modern School has no rewards or punishments, exams or mark -- the
everyday tortures of conventional schooling. And because practical
knowledge is more useful than theory, lessons were often held in
factories, museums or the countryside. The school was also used by
parents, and Ferrer planned a Popular University.

> *"Higher education, for the privileged few, should be for the general
> public, as every human has a right to know; and science, which is
> produced by observers and workers of all countries and ages, ought not
> be restricted to class."* [Ferrer, quoted by Harper, **Op. Cit.**, p.
> 100]

Thus Modern Schools are based on encouraging self-education in a
co-operative, egalitarian and libertarian atmosphere in which the pupil
(regardless of age) can develop themselves and their interests to the
fullest of their abilities. In this way Modern Schools seek to create
anarchists by a process of education which respects the individual and
gets them to develop their own abilities in a conducive setting.

Modern Schools have been a constant aspect of the anarchist movement
since the late 1890s. The movement was started in France by Louise
Michel and Sebastien Faure, where Francisco Ferrer became acquainted
with them. He founded his Modern School in Barcelona in 1901, and by
1905 there were 50 similar schools in Spain (many of them funded by
anarchist groups and trade unions and, from 1919 onward, by the C.N.T.
-- in all cases the autonomy of the schools was respected). In 1909,
Ferrer was falsely accused by the Spanish government of leading an
insurrection and executed in spite of world-wide protest and
overwhelming proof of his innocence. His execution, however, gained him
and his educational ideas international recognition and inspired a
Modern School progressive education movement across the globe.

However, for most anarchists, Modern Schools are not enough in
themselves to produce a libertarian society. They agree with Bakunin:

> *"For individuals to be moralised and become fully human . . . three
> things are necessary: a hygienic birth, all-round education,
> accompanied by an upbringing based on respect for labour, reason,
> equality, and freedom and a social environment wherein each human
> individual will enjoy full freedom and really by, **de jure** and **de
> facto**, the equal of every other.*

> *"Does this environment exist? No. Then it must be established. . .
> [otherwise] in the existing social environment . . . on leaving
> [libertarian] schools they [the student] would enter a society
> governed by totally opposite principles, and, because society is
> always stronger than individuals, it would prevail over them . . .
> [and] demoralise them."* [**The Basic Bakunin**, p, 174]

Because of this, Modern Schools must be part of a mass working class
revolutionary movement which aims to build as many aspects of the new
world as possible in the old one before, ultimately, replacing it.
Otherwise they are just useful as social experiments and their impact on
society marginal. Thus, for anarchists, this process of education is
**part of** the class struggle, not in place of it and so *"the workers
[must] do everything possible to obtain all the education they can in
the material circumstances in which they currently find themselves . . .
[while] concentrat[ing] their efforts on the great question of their
economic emancipation, the mother of all other emancipations."*
[Bakunin, **Op. Cit.**, p. 175]

Before finishing, we must stress that hierarchical education (like the
media), cannot remove the effects of actual life and activity in
shaping/changing people and their ideas, opinions and attitudes. While
education is an essential part of maintaining the status quo and
accustoming people to accept hierarchy, the state and wage slavery, it
cannot stop individuals from learning from their experiences, ignoring
their sense of right and wrong, recognising the injustices of the
current system and the ideas that it is based upon. This means that even
the best state (or private) education system will still produce rebels
-- for the **experience** of wage slavery and state oppression (and,
most importantly, **struggle**) is shattering to the **ideology**
spoon-fed children during their "education" and reinforced by the media.

J.5.14 What is Libertarian Municipalism?
----------------------------------------

As we noted in [section J.2](secJ2.html), most anarchists reject
participating in electoral politics. A notable exception was Murray
Bookchin who not only proposed voting but also a non-parliamentary
electoral strategy for anarchists. He repeated this proposal in many of
his later works, such as **From Urbanisation to Cities**, and has made
it -- at least in the USA -- one of the many alternatives anarchists are
involved in.

According to Bookchin, *"the proletariat, as do all oppressed sectors of
society, comes to life when it sheds its industrial habits in the free
and spontaneous activity of **communising,** or taking part in the
political life of the community."* In other words, Bookchin thought that
democratisation of local communities may be as strategically important,
or perhaps more important, to anarchists than workplace struggles. Since
local politics is humanly scaled, Bookchin argued that it can be
participatory rather than parliamentary. Or, as he put it, the
*"anarchic ideal of decentralised, stateless, collectively managed, and
directly democratic communities -- of confederated municipalities or
'communes' -- speaks almost intuitively, and in the best works of
Proudhon and Kropotkin, consciously, to the transforming role of
libertarian municipalism as the framework of a liberatory society."*
*"Theses on Libertarian Municipalism"*, pp. 9-22, **The Anarchist
Papers**, Dimitrios I. Roussopoulos (ed.),p. 10] He also pointed out
that, historically, the city has been the principle countervailing force
to imperial and national states, haunting them as a potential challenge
to centralised power and continuing to do so today, as can be seen in
the conflicts between national government and municipalities in many
countries.

Despite the libertarian potential of urban politics, "urbanisation" --
the growth of the modern megalopolis as a vast wasteland of suburbs,
shopping malls, industrial parks, and slums that foster political apathy
and isolation in realms of alienated production and private consumption
-- is antithetical to the continued existence of those aspects of the
city that might serve as the framework for a libertarian municipalism:
*"When urbanisation will have effaced city life so completely that the
city no longer has its own identity, culture, and spaces for
consociation, the bases for democracy -- in whatever way the word in
defined -- will have disappeared and the question of revolutionary forms
will be a shadow game of abstractions."* Despite this danger Bookchin
argued that a libertarian politics of local government is still
possible, provided anarchists get our act together: *"The Commune still
lies buried in the city council; the sections still lie buried in the
neighbourhood; the town meeting still lies buried in the township;
confederal forms of municipal association still lie buried in regional
networks of towns and cities."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 16 and p. 21]

What would anarchists do electorally at the local level? Bookchin
proposed that libertarians stand in local elections in order to change
city and town charters to make them participatory: *"An organic politics
based on such radical participatory forms of civic association does not
exclude the right of anarchists to alter city and town charters such
that they validate the existence of directly democratic institutions.
And if this kind of activity brings anarchists into city councils, there
is no reason why such a politics should be construed as parliamentary,
particularly if it is confined to the civic level and is consciously
posed against the state."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 21]

In short, Libertarian Muncipalism *"depends upon libertarian leftists
running candidates at the local level, calling for the division of
municipalities into wards, where popular assemblies can be created that
bring people into full and direct participation in political life . . .
municipalities would [then] confederate into a dual power to oppose the
nation-state and ultimately dispense with it and with the economic
forces that underpin statism as such."* [**Democracy and Nature** no. 9,
p. 158] This would be part of a social wide transformation, whose
*"[m]inimal steps . . . include initiating Left Green municipalist
movements that propose neighbourhood and town assemblies -- even if they
have only moral functions at first -- and electing town and city
councillors that advance the cause of these assemblies and other popular
institutions. These minimal steps can lead step-by-step to the formation
of confederal bodies . . . Civic banks to fund municipal enterprises and
land purchases; the fostering of new ecologically-orientated enterprises
that are owned by the community."* Thus Bookchin saw Libertarian
Muncipalism as a process by which the state can be undermined by using
elections as the means of creating popular assemblies. Part of this
would be the *"municipalisation of property"* which would *"bring the
economy **as a whole** into the orbit of the public sphere, where
economic policy could be formulated by the **entire** community."*
[**From Urbanisation to Cities**, p. 266 and p. 235]

In evaluating Bookchin's proposal, several points come to mind.

Firstly, it is clear that Libertarian Muncipalism's arguments in favour
of community assemblies is important and cannot be ignored. Bookchin was
right to note that, in the past, many anarchists placed far too much
stress on workplace struggles and workers' councils as the framework of
a free society. Many of the really important issues that affect us
cannot be reduced to workplace organisations, which by their very nature
disenfranchise those who do not work in industry (such as housewives,
the old, and so on). And, of course, there is far more to life than work
and so any future society organised purely around workplace
organisations is reproducing capitalism's insane glorification of
economic activity, at least to some degree. So, in this sense,
Libertarian Muncipalism has a very valid point -- a free society will be
created and maintained within the community as well as in the workplace.
However, this perspective was hardly alien to such anarchist thinkers as
Proudhon, Bakunin and Kropotkin who all placed communes at the centre of
their vision of a free society.

Secondly, Bookchin and other Libertarian Muncipalists are correct to
argue that anarchists should work in their local communities. Many
anarchists are doing just that and are being very successful as well.
However, most anarchists reject the idea of a *"confederal muncipalist
movement run[ning] candidates for municipal councils with demands for
the institution of public assemblies"* as viable means of *"struggle
toward creating new civic institutions out of old ones (or replacing the
old ones altogether)."* [Bookchin, **Op. Cit.**, p. 229 and p. 267]

The most serious objection to this has to do with whether politics in
most cities has already become too centralised, bureaucratic, inhumanly
scaled, and dominated by capitalist interests to have any possibility of
being taken over by anarchists running on platforms of participatory
democratisation. Merely to pose the question seems enough to answer it.
There is no such possibility in the vast majority of cities, and hence
it would be a waste of time and energy for anarchists to support
libertarian municipalist candidates in local elections -- time and
energy that could be more profitably spent in direct action. If the
central governments are too bureaucratic and unresponsive to be used by
Libertarian Municipalists, the same can be said of local ones too --
particularly as the local state has become increasingly controlled by
the central authorities (in the UK, for example, the Conservative
government of the 1980s successfully centralised power away from local
councils to undercut their ability to resist the imposition of its
neo-liberal policies).

The counter-argument to this is that even if there is no chance of such
candidates being elected, their standing for elections would serve a
valuable educational function. The answer to this is: perhaps, but would
it be more valuable than direct action? Would its educational value, if
any, outweigh the disadvantages of electioneering discussed in [section
J.2](secJ2.html)? Given the ability of major media to marginalise
alternative candidates, we doubt that such campaigns would have enough
educational value to outweigh these disadvantages. Moreover, being an
anarchist does not make one immune to the corrupting effects of
electioneering. History is littered with radical, politically aware
movements using elections and ending up becoming part of the system they
aimed to transform. Most anarchists doubt that Libertarian Muncipalism
will be any different -- after all, it is the circumstances the parties
find themselves in which are decisive, not the theory they hold. Why
would libertarians be immune to this but not Marxists or Greens?

Lastly, most anarchists question the whole process on which Libertarian
Muncipalism bases itself on. The idea of communes is a key one of
anarchism and so strategies to create them in the here and now are
important. However, to think that using alienated, representative
institutions to abolish these institutions is wrong. As Italian
activists who organised a neighbourhood assembly by non-electoral means
argue *"[t]o accept power and to say that the others were acting in bad
faith and that we would be better, would **force** non-anarchists
towards direct democracy. We reject this logic and believe that
organisations must come from the grassroots."* [*"Community Organising
in Southern Italy"*, pp. 16-19, **Black Flag** no. 210, p. 18]

Thus Libertarian Municipalism reverses the process by which community
assemblies will be created. Instead of anarchists using elections to
build such bodies, they must work in their communities directly to
create them (see [section J.5.1](secJ5.html#secj51) for more details).
Using the catalyst of specific issues of local interest, anarchists
could propose the creation of a community assembly to discuss the issues
in question and organise action to solve them. Rather than stand in
local elections, anarchists should encourage people to create these
institutions themselves and empower themselves by collective
self-activity. As Kropotkin argued, *"Laws can only **follow** the
accomplished facts; and even if they do honestly follow them -- which is
usually **not** the case -- a law remains a dead letter so long as there
are not on the spot the living forces required for making the
**tendencies** expressed in the law an accomplished **fact**."*
[**Anarchism**, p. 171] Most anarchists, therefore, think it is far more
important to create the *"living forces"* within our communities
directly than waste energy in electioneering and the passing of laws
creating or "legalising" community assemblies. In other words, community
assemblies can only be created from the bottom up, by non-electoral
means, a process which Libertarian Muncipalism confuses with
electioneering.

So, while Libertarian Muncipalism **does** raise many important issues
and correctly stresses the importance of community activity and
self-management, its emphasis on electoral activity undercuts its
liberatory promise. For most anarchists, community assemblies can only
be created from below, by direct action, and (because of its electoral
strategy) a Libertarian Municipalist movement will end up being
transformed into a copy of the system it aims to abolish.

J.5.15 What attitude do anarchists take to the welfare state?
-------------------------------------------------------------

The period of neo-liberalism since the 1980s has seen a rollback of the
state within society by the right-wing in the name of "freedom,"
"individual responsibility" and "efficiency." The position of anarchists
to this process is mixed. On the one hand, we are all in favour of
reducing the size of the state and increasing individual responsibility
and freedom but, on the other, we are well aware that this rollback is
part of an attack on the working class and tends to increase the power
of the capitalists over us as the state's (direct) influence is reduced.
Thus anarchists appear to be on the horns of a dilemma -- or, at least,
apparently.

So what attitude **do** anarchists take to the welfare state and attacks
on it?

First we must note that this attack on "welfare" is somewhat selective.
While using the rhetoric of "self-reliance" and "individualism," the
practitioners of these "tough love" programmes have made sure that the
major corporations continue to get state hand-outs and aid while
attacking social welfare. In other words, the current attack on the
welfare state is an attempt to impose market discipline on the working
class while increasing state protection for the ruling class. Therefore,
most anarchists have no problem defending social welfare programmes as
these can be considered as only fair considering the aid the capitalist
class has always received from the state (both direct subsidies and
protection and indirect support via laws that protect property and so
on). And, for all their talk of increasing individual choice, the
right-wing remain silent about the lack of choice and individual freedom
during working hours within capitalism.

Secondly, most of the right-wing inspired attacks on the welfare state
are inaccurate. For example, Noam Chomsky notes that the *"correlation
between welfare payments and family life is real, though it is the
reverse of what is claimed [by the right]. As support for the poor has
declined, unwed birth-rates, which had risen steadily from the 1940s
through the mid-1970s, markedly increased. 'Over the last three decades,
the rate of poverty among children almost perfectly correlates with the
birth-rates among teenage mothers a decade later,' Mike Males points
out: 'That is, child poverty seems to lead to teenage childbearing, not
the other way around.'"* [*"Rollback III"*, **Z Magazine**, April, 1995]
The same charge of inaccurate scare-mongering can be laid at the claims
about the evil effects of welfare which the rich and large corporations
wish to save others (but not themselves) from. Such altruism is truly
heart warming. For those in the United States or familiar with it, the
same can be said of the hysterical attacks on "socialised medicine" and
health-care reform funded by insurance companies and parroted by
right-wing ideologues and politicians.

Thirdly, anarchists are just as opposed to capitalism as they are the
state. This means that privatising state functions is no more
libertarian than nationalising them. In fact, less so as such a process
**reduces** the limited public say state control implies in favour of
more private tyranny and wage-labour. As such, attempts to erode the
welfare state without other, pro-working class, social reforms violates
the anti-capitalist part of anarchism. Similarly, the introduction of a
state supported welfare system rather than a for-profit capitalist run
system (as in America) would hardly be considered any more a violation
of libertarian principles as the reverse happening. In terms of reducing
human suffering, though, most anarchists would oppose the latter and be
in favour of the former while aiming to create a third (self-managed)
alternative.

Fourthly, we must note that while most anarchists **are** in favour of
collective self-help and welfare, we are opposed to the state. Part of
the alternatives anarchists try and create are self-managed and
community welfare projects (see [next section](secJ5.html#secj516)).
Moreover, in the past, anarchists and syndicalists were at the forefront
in opposing state welfare schemes. This was because they were introduced
**not** by socialists but by liberals and other supporters of capitalism
to undercut support for radical alternatives and to aid long term
economic development by creating the educated and healthy population
required to use advanced technology and fight wars. Thus we find that:

> *"Liberal social welfare legislation . . . were seen by many [British
> syndicalists] not as genuine welfare reforms, but as mechanisms of
> social control. Syndicalists took a leading part in resisting such
> legislation on the grounds that it would increase capitalist
> discipline over labour, thereby undermining working class independence
> and self-reliance."* [Bob Holton, **British Syndicalism: 1900-1914**,
> p. 137]

Anarchists view the welfare state much as some feminists do. While they
note, to quote Carole Pateman, the *"patriarchal structure of the
welfare state"* they are also aware that it has *"also brought
challenges to patriarchal power and helped provide a basis for women's
autonomous citizenship."* She goes on to note that *"for women to look
at the welfare state is merely to exchange dependence on individual men
for dependence on the state. The power and capriciousness of husbands is
replaced by the arbitrariness, bureaucracy and power of the state, the
very state that has upheld patriarchal power."* This *"will not in
itself do anything to challenge patriarchal power relations."* [**The
Disorder of Women**, p. 195 and p. 200]

Thus while the welfare state does give working people more options than
having to take **any** job or put up with **any** conditions, this
relative independence from the market and individual capitalists has
came at the price of dependence on the state -- the very institution
that protects and supports capitalism in the first place. And has we
have became painfully aware in recent years, it is the ruling class who
has most influence in the state -- and so, when it comes to deciding
what state budgets to cut, social welfare ones are first in line. Given
that such programmes are controlled by the state, **not** working class
people, such an outcome is hardly surprising. Not only this, we also
find that state control reproduces the same hierarchical structures that
the capitalist firm creates.

Unsurprisingly, anarchists have no great love of such state welfare
schemes and desire their replacement by self-managed alternatives. For
example, taking municipal housing, Colin Ward writes:

> *"The municipal tenant is trapped in a syndrome of dependence and
> resentment, which is an accurate reflection of his housing situation.
> People care about what is theirs, what they can modify, alter, adapt
> to changing needs and improve themselves. They must have a direct
> responsibility for it . . . The tenant take-over of the municipal
> estate is one of those obviously sensible ideas which is dormant
> because our approach to municipal affairs is still stuck in the groves
> of nineteenth-century paternalism."* [**Anarchy in Action**, p. 73]

Looking at state supported education, Ward argues that the *"universal
education system turns out to be yet another way in which the poor
subsidise the rich."* Which is the least of its problems, for *"it is in
the **nature** of public authorities to run coercive and hierarchical
institutions whose ultimate function is to perpetuate social inequality
and to brainwash the young into the acceptance of their particular slot
in the organised system."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 83 and p. 81] The role of
state education as a means of systematically indoctrinating the working
class is reflected in William Lazonick words:

> *"The Education Act of 1870 . . . [gave the] state . . . the
> facilities . . . to make education compulsory for all children from
> the age of five to the age of ten. It had also erected a powerful
> system of ideological control over the next generation of workers . .
> . [It] was to function as a prime ideological mechanism in the attempt
> by the capitalist class through the medium of the state, to
> continually **reproduce** a labour force which would passively accept
> [the] subjection [of labour to the domination of capital]. At the same
> time it had set up a public institution which could potentially be
> used by the working class for just the contrary purpose."* [*"The
> Subjection of Labour to Capital: The rise of the Capitalist System"*,
> **Radical Political Economy** Vol. 2, p. 363]

Lazonick, as did Pateman, indicates the contradictory nature of welfare
provisions within capitalism. On the one hand, they are introduced to
help control the working class (and to improve long term economic
development). On the other hand, these provisions can be used by working
class people as weapons against capitalism and give themselves more
options than "work or starve" (the fact that the attacks on welfare in
the UK during the 1990s -- called, ironically enough, **welfare to
work** -- involves losing benefits if you refuse a job is not a
surprising development). Thus we find that welfare acts as a kind of
floor under wages. In the US, the two have followed a common trajectory
(rising together and falling together). And it is **this**, the
potential benefits welfare can have for working people, that is the
**real** cause for the current capitalist attacks upon it. As Noam
Chomsky summarises:

> *"State authority is now under severe attack in the more democratic
> societies, but not because it conflicts with the libertarian vision.
> Rather the opposite: because it offers (weak) protection to some
> aspects of that vision. Governments have a fatal flaw: unlike the
> private tyrannies, the institutions of state power and authority offer
> to the public an opportunity to play some role, however limited, in
> managing their own affairs."* [**Chomsky on Anarchism**, p. 193]

Because of this contradictory nature of welfare, we find anarchists like
Noam Chomsky arguing that (using an expression popularised by South
American rural workers unions) *"we should 'expand the floor of the
cage.' We know we're in a cage. We know we're trapped. We're going to
expand the floor, meaning we will extend to the limits what the cage
will allow. And we intend to destroy the cage. But not by attacking the
cage when we're vulnerable, so they'll murder us . . . You have to
protect the cage when it's under attack from even worse predators from
outside, like private power. And you have to expand the floor of the
cage, recognising that it's a cage. These are all preliminaries to
dismantling it. Unless people are willing to tolerate that level of
complexity, they're going to be of no use to people who are suffering
and who need help, or, for that matter, to themselves."* [**Expanding
the Floor of the Cage**]

Thus, even though we know the welfare state is a cage and part of an
instrument of class power, we have to defend it from a worse possibility
-- namely, the state as "pure" defender of capitalism with working
people with few or no rights. At least the welfare state does have a
contradictory nature, the tensions of which can be used to increase our
options. And one of these options is its abolition **from below**!

For example, with regards to municipal housing, anarchists will be the
first to agree that it is paternalistic, bureaucratic and hardly a
wonderful living experience. However, in stark contrast with the right
who desire to privatise such estates, anarchists think that *"tenants
control"* is the best solution as it gives us the benefits of individual
ownership **along with** community (and so without the negative points
of property, such as social atomisation). The demand for *"tenant
control"* must come from below, by the *"collective resistance"* of the
tenants themselves, perhaps as a result of struggles against
*"continuous rent increases"* leading to *"the demand . . . for a change
in the status of the tenant."* Such a *"tenant take-over of the
municipal estate is one of those sensible ideas which is dormant because
our approach to municipal affairs is still stuck in the grooves of
nineteenth century paternalism."* [Ward, **Op. Cit.**, p. 73]

And it is here that we find the ultimate irony of the right-wing, "free
market" attempts to abolish the welfare state -- neo-liberalism wants to
end welfare **from above,** by means of the state (which is the
instigator of this individualistic "reform"). It does not seek the end
of dependency by self-liberation, but the shifting of dependency from
state to charity and the market. In contrast, anarchists desire to
abolish welfare from **below**. This the libertarian attitude to those
government policies which actually do help people. While anarchists
would *"hesitate to condemn those measures taken by governments which
obviously benefited the people, unless we saw the immediate possibility
of people carrying them out for themselves. This would not inhibit us
from declaring at the same time that what initiatives governments take
would be more successfully taken by the people themselves if they put
their minds to the same problems . . . to build up a hospital service or
a transport system, for instance, from local needs into a national
organisation, by agreement and consent at all levels is surely more
economical as well as efficient than one which is conceived at top level
[by the state] . . . where Treasury, political and other pressures, not
necessarily connected with what we would describe as **needs**,
influence the shaping of policies."* So *"as long as we have capitalism
and government the job of anarchists is to fight both, and at the same
time encourage people to take what steps they can to run their own
lives."* [*"Anarchists and Voting"*, pp. 176-87, **The Raven**, No. 14,
p. 179]

Ultimately, unlike the state socialist/liberal left, anarchists reject
the idea that the cause of socialism, of a free society, can be helped
by using the state. Like the right, the left see political action in
terms of the state. All its favourite policies have been statist --
state intervention in the economy, nationalisation, state welfare, state
education and so on. Whatever the problem, the left see the solution as
lying in the extension of the power of the state. They continually push
people in relying on **others** to solve their problems for them.
Moreover, such state-based "aid" does not get to the core of the
problem. All it does is fight the symptoms of capitalism and statism
without attacking their root causes -- the system itself.

Invariably, this support for the state is a move away from working class
people, from trusting and empowering them to sort out their own
problems. Indeed, the left seem to forget that the state exists to
defend the collective interests of the ruling class and so could hardly
be considered a neutral body. And, worst of all, they have presented the
right with the opportunity of stating that freedom from the state means
the same thing as the freedom of the market (so ignoring the awkward
fact that capitalism is based upon domination -- wage labour -- and
needs many repressive measures in order to exist and survive).
Anarchists are of the opinion that changing the boss for the state (or
vice versa) is only a step sideways, **not** forward! After all, it is
**not** working people who control how the welfare state is run, it is
politicians, "experts", bureaucrats and managers who do so (*"Welfare is
administered by a top-heavy governmental machine which ensures that when
economies in public expenditure are imposed by its political masters,
they are made in reducing the service to the public, not by reducing the
cost of administration."* [Ward, **Op. Cit.** p. 10]). Little wonder we
have seen elements of the welfare state used as a weapon in the class
war **against** those in struggle (for example, in Britain during the
miners strike in 1980s the Conservative Government made it illegal to
claim benefits while on strike, so reducing the funds available to
workers in struggle and helping bosses force strikers back to work
faster).

Anarchists consider it far better to encourage those who suffer
injustice to organise themselves and in that way they can change what
**they** think is actually wrong, as opposed to what politicians and
"experts" claim is wrong. If sometimes part of this struggle involves
protecting aspects of the welfare state (*"expanding the floor of the
cage"*) so be it -- but we will never stop there and will use such
struggles as a stepping stone in abolishing the welfare state **from
below** by creating self-managed, working class, alternatives. As part
of this process anarchists also seek to **transform** those aspects of
the welfare state they may be trying to "protect". They do not defend an
institution which **is** paternalistic, bureaucratic and unresponsive.
For example, if we are involved in trying to stop a local state-run
hospital or school from closing, anarchists would try to raise the issue
of self-management and local community control into the struggle in the
hope of going beyond the status quo.

In this, we follow the suggestion made by Proudhon that rather than
*"fatten certain contractors,"* libertarians should be aiming to create
*"a new kind of property"* by *"granting the privilege of running"*
public utilities, industries and services, *"under fixed conditions, to
responsible companies, not of capitalists, but of workmen."*
Municipalities would take the initiative in setting up public works but
actual control would rest with workers' co-operatives for *"it becomes
necessary for the workers to form themselves into democratic societies,
with equal conditions for all members, on pain of a relapse into
feudalism."* [**General Idea of the Revolution**, p. 151 and p. 276-7]
Thus, for example, rather than nationalise or privatise railways, they
should be handed over workers' co-operatives to run. The same with
welfare services and such like: *"the abolition of the State is the last
term of a series, which consists of an incessant diminution, by
political and administrative simplification the number of public
functionaries and to put into the care of responsible workers societies
the works and services confided to the state."* [Proudhon, **Carnets**,
vol. 3, p. 293]

Not only does this mean that we can get accustomed to managing our own
affairs collectively, it also means that we can ensure that whatever
"safety-nets" we have do what we want and not what capital wants. In the
end, what we create and run by ourselves will be more responsive to our
needs, and the needs of the class struggle, than reformist aspects of
the capitalist state. This much, we think, is obvious. And it is ironic
to see elements of the "radical" and "revolutionary" left argue against
this working class self-help (and so ignore the **long** tradition of
such activity in working class movements) and instead select for the
agent of their protection a state run by and for capitalists!

There are two traditions of welfare within society, one of *"fraternal
and autonomous associations springing from below, the other that of
authoritarian institutions directed from above."* [Ward, **Op. Cit.**,
p. 123] While sometimes anarchists are forced to defend the latter
against the greater evil of "free market" capitalism, we never forget
the importance of creating and strengthening the former. As Chomsky
suggests, libertarians have to *"defend some state institutions from the
attack against them [by private power], while trying at the same time to
pry them open to meaningful public participation -- and ultimately, to
dismantle them in a much more free society, if the appropriate
circumstances can be achieved."* [**Chomsky on Anarchism**, p. 194] A
point we will discuss more in [the next section](secJ5.html#secj516)
when we highlight the historical examples of self-managed communal
welfare and self-help organisations.

J.5.16 Are there any historical examples of collective self-help?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, in all societies we see working class people joining together to
practice mutual aid and solidarity. This takes many forms, such as trade
and industrial unions, credit unions and friendly societies,
co-operatives and so on, but the natural response of working class
people to the injustices of capitalism was to practice collective
"self-help" in order to improve their lives and protect their friends,
communities and fellow workers.

There are, as Colin Ward stresses, *"in fact several quite separate
traditions of social welfare: the product of totally different attitudes
to social needs . . . One of these traditions is that of a service given
grudgingly and punitively by authority, another is the expression of
social responsibility, or of mutual aid and self-help. One is embodied
in **institutions**, the other in **associations**."* [**Anarchy in
Action**, p. 112] Anarchists, needless to say, favour the latter.
Unfortunately, this *"great tradition of working class self-help and
mutual aid was written off, not just as irrelevant, but as an actual
impediment, by the political and professional architects of the welfare
state . . . The contribution that the recipients had to make to all this
theoretical bounty was ignored as a mere embarrassment -- apart, of
course, for paying for it . . . The socialist ideal was rewritten as a
world in which everyone was entitled to everything, but where nobody
except the providers had any actual say about anything. We have been
learning for years, in the anti-welfare backlash, what a vulnerable
utopia that was."* This self-managed working class self-help was the
*"welfare road we failed to take."* [Ward, **Social Policy: an anarchist
response**, p. 11-2 and p. 9]

Anarchists would argue that self-help is the natural side effect of
freedom. There is no possibility of radical social change unless people
are free to decide for themselves what their problems are, where their
interests lie and are free to organise for themselves what they want to
do about them. Self-help is a natural expression of people taking
control of their own lives and acting for themselves. Anyone who urges
state action on behalf of people is no socialist and any one arguing
against self-help as "bourgeois" is no anti-capitalist. It is somewhat
ironic that it is the right who have monopolised the rhetoric of
"self-help" and turned it into yet another ideological weapon against
working class direct action and self-liberation (although, saying that,
the right generally likes individualised self-help -- given a strike,
squatting or any other form of **collective** self-help movement they
will be the first to denounce it):

> *"The political Left has, over the years, committed an enormous
> psychological error in allowing this kind of language ["self-help",
> "mutual aid", "standing on your own two feet" and so on] to be
> appropriated by the political Right. If you look at the exhibitions of
> trade union banners from the last century, you will see slogans like
> Self Help embroidered all over them. It was those clever Fabians and
> academic Marxists who ridiculed out of existence the values by which
> ordinary citizens govern their own lives in favour of bureaucratic
> paternalising, leaving those values around to be picked up by their
> political opponents."* [Ward, **Talking Houses**, p. 58]

We cannot be expected to provide an extensive list of working class
collective self-help and social welfare activity here, all we can do is
present an overview of collective welfare in action (for a discussion of
working class self-help and co-operation through the centuries we can
suggest no better source than Kropotkin's **Mutual Aid**). In the case
of Britain, we find that the *"newly created working class built up from
nothing a vast network of social and economic initiatives based on
self-help and mutual aid. The list is endless: friendly societies,
building societies, sick clubs, coffin clubs, clothing clubs, up to
enormous federated enterprises like the trade union movement and the
Co-operative movement."* [Ward, **Social Policy**, pp. 10-1] The
historian E.P. Thompson confirmed this picture of a wide network of
working class self-help organisations. *"Small tradesmen, artisans,
labourers"* he summarised, *"all sought to insure themselves against
sickness, unemployment, or funeral expenses through membership of . . .
friendly societies."* These were *"authentic evidence of independent
working-class culture and institutions . . . out of which . . . trade
unions grew, and in which trade union officers were trained."* Friendly
societies *"did not 'proceed from' an idea: both the ideas and
institutions arose from a certain common experience . . . In the simple
cellular structure of the friendly society, with its workaday ethos of
mutual aid, we see many features which were reproduced in more
sophisticated and complex form in trade unions, co-operatives, Hampden
clubs, Political Unions, and Chartist lodges . . . Every kind of witness
in the first half of the nineteenth century -- clergymen, factory
inspectors, Radical publicists -- remarked upon the extent of mutual aid
in the poorest districts. In times of emergency, unemployment, strikes,
sickness, childbirth, then it was the poor who 'helped every one his
neighbour.'"* [**The Making of the English Working Class**, p. 458, pp.
460-1 and p. 462] Sam Dolgoff gave an excellent summary of similar
self-help activities by the American working class:

> *"Long before the labour movement got corrupted and the state stepped
> in, the workers organised a network of co-operative institutions of
> all kinds: schools, summer camps for children and adults, homes for
> the aged, health and cultural centres, credit associations, fire,
> life, and health insurance, technical education, housing, etc."*
> [**The American Labour Movement: A New Beginning**, p. 74]

Dolgoff, like all anarchists, urged workers to *"finance the
establishment of independent co-operative societies of all types, which
will respond adequately to their needs"* and that such a movement
*"could constitute a realistic alternative to the horrendous abuses of
the 'establishment' at a fraction of the cost."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 74
and pp. 74-75] In this way a network of self-managed, communal, welfare
associations and co-operatives could be built -- paid for, run by and
run for working class people. Such a system *"would not . . . become a
plaything of central government financial policy."* [Ward, **Op. Cit.**,
p. 16] Such a network could be initially build upon, and be an aspect
of, the struggles of both workers in and claimants, patients, tenants,
and other users of the current welfare state. So a *"multiplicity of
mutual aid organisations among claimants, patients, victims, represents
the most potent lever for change in transforming the welfare state into
a genuine welfare society, in turning community care into a caring
community."* [Ward, **Anarchy in Action**, p. 125]

The creation of such a co-operative, community-based, welfare system
will not occur over night, nor will it be easy. But it **is** possible,
as history shows. It will, of course, have its problems, but as Colin
Ward notes, *"the standard argument against a localist and decentralised
point of view, is that of universalism: an equal service to all
citizens, which it is thought that central control achieves. The short
answer to this is that it doesn't!"* [Colin Ward, **Social Policy**, p.
16] He notes that richer areas generally get a better service from the
welfare state than poorer ones, thus violating the claims of equal
service. A centralised system (be it state or private) will most likely
allocate resources which reflect the interests and (lack of) knowledge
of bureaucrats and experts, **not** on where they are best used or the
needs of the users.

Anarchists are sure that a **confederal** network of mutual aid
organisations and co-operatives, based upon local input and control, can
overcome problems of localism far better than a centralised one --
which, due to its lack of local input and participation will more likely
**encourage** parochialism and indifference than a wider vision and
solidarity. If you have no real say in what affects you, why should you
be concerned with what affects others? This is unsurprising, for what
else is global action other than the product of thousands of local
actions? Solidarity within our class is the flower that grows from the
soil of our local self-activity, direct action and self-organisation.
Unless we act and organise locally, any wider organisation and action
will be hollow. Thus **local** organisation and empowerment is essential
to create and maintain wider organisations and mutual aid.

To take another example of the benefits of a self-managed welfare
system, we find that it *"was a continual complaint of the authorities"*
in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century *"that friendly
societies allowed members to withdraw funds when on strike."* [Thompson,
**Op. Cit.**, p. 461f] The same complaints were voiced in Britain about
the welfare state allowing strikers to claim benefit will on strike. The
Conservative Government of the 1980s changed that by passing a law
barring those in industrial dispute to claim benefits -- and so removing
a potential support for those in struggle. Such a restriction would have
been far harder (if not impossible) to impose on a network of
self-managed mutual aid co-operatives. Such institutions would have not
become the plaything of central government financial policy as the
welfare state and the taxes working class people have to pay have
become.

All this means that anarchists reject the phoney choice between private
and state capitalism we are usually offered. We reject both
privatisation **and** nationalisation, both right and left wings (of
capitalism). Neither state nor private health care are user-controlled
-- one is subject to the requirements of politics and the other places
profits before people. As we have discussed the welfare state in the
[last section](secJ5.html#secj515), it is worthwhile to quickly discuss
privatised welfare and why anarchists reject this option even more than
state welfare.

Firstly, all forms of private healthcare/welfare have to pay dividends
to capitalists, fund advertising, reduce costs to maximise profits by
standardising the "caring" process - i.e. McDonaldisation - and so on,
all of which inflates prices and produces substandard service across the
industry as a whole. According to Alfie Kohn, *"[m]ore hospitals and
clinics are being run by for-profit corporations; many institutions,
forced to battle for 'customers,' seem to value a skilled director of
marketing more highly than a skilled caregiver. As in any other economic
sector, the race for profits translates into pressure to reduce costs,
and the easiest way to do it here is to cut back on services to
unprofitable patients, that is, those who are more sick than rich . . .
The result: hospital costs are actually **higher** in areas where there
is more competition for patients."* [**No Contest**, p. 240] In the UK,
attempts to introduce "market forces" into the National Health Service
has also lead to increased costs as well as inflating the size and cost
of its bureaucracy.

Looking at Chile, hyped by those who desire to privatise Social
Security, we find similar disappointing results (well, disappointing for
the working class at least, as we will see). Seemingly, Chile's private
system has achieved impressive average returns on investment. However,
once commissions are factored in, the real return for individual workers
is considerably lower. For example, although the average rate of return
on funds from 1982 through 1986 was 15.9 percent, the real return after
commissions was a mere 0.3 percent! Between 1991 and 1995, the
pre-commission return was 12.9 percent, but with commissions it fell to
2.1 percent. According to Doug Henwood, the *"competing mutual funds
have vast sales forces, and the portfolio managers all have their vast
fees. All in all, administrative costs . . . are almost 30% of revenues,
compared to well under 1% for the U.S. Social Security system."* [**Wall
Street**, p. 305] In addition, the private pension fund market is
dominated by a handful of companies.

Even if commission costs were lowered (by regulation), the impressive
returns on capital seen between 1982 and 1995 (when the real annual
return on investment averaged 12.7 percent) are likely not to be
sustained. These average returns coincided with boom years in Chile,
complemented by government's high borrowing costs. Because of the debt
crisis of the 1980s, Latin governments were paying double-digit real
interest rates on their bonds -- the main investment vehicle of social
security funds. In effect, government was subsidising the "private"
system by paying astronomical rates on government bonds. Another failing
of the system is that only a little over half of Chilean workers make
regular social security contributions. While many believe that a private
system would reduce evasion because workers have a greater incentive to
contribute to their own personal retirement accounts, 43.4 percent of
those affiliated with the new system in June of 1995 did not contribute
regularly. [Stephen J. Kay, *"The Chile Con: Privatizing Social Security
in South America,"* **The American Prospect** no. 33, pp. 48-52] All in
all, privatisation seems to be beneficial only to middle-men and
capitalists, if Chile is anything to go by. As Henwood argues, while the
*"infusion of money"* resulting from privatising social security *"has
done wonders for the Chilean stock market"* *"projections are that as
many as half of future retirees will draw a poverty-level pension."*
[Henwood, **Op. Cit.**, pp. 304-5]

Suffice to say, all you really need to know about privatisation of
pensions and healthcare in Chile is that the military dictatorship which
imposed it excluded the military from its dubious benefits. Such
altruism is truly touching.

So, anarchists reject private welfare as a con (and an even bigger one
than state welfare). As Colin Ward suggests, it *"is the question of how
we get back on the mutual aid road **instead of** commercial health
insurance and private pension schemes."* [**Social Policy**, p. 17] As
anarchists are both anti-state and anti-capitalist, swapping private
power for the state power is, at best, a step sideways. Usually, it is
worse for capitalist companies are accountable only to their owners and
the profit criteria. This means, as Chomsky suggests, *"protecting the
state sector today is a step towards abolishing the state because it
maintains a public arena in which people can participate and organise,
and affect policy, and so on, though in limited ways. If that's removed,
we'd go back to a . . . private dictatorship, but that's hardly a step
towards liberation."* [ **Chomsky on Anarchism**, p. 213] Instead
anarchists try to create **real** alternatives to hierarchy, be it state
or capitalist, in the here and now which reflect our ideas of a free and
just society. For, when it boils down to it, freedom cannot be given,
only taken and this process of **self**-liberation is reflected in the
alternatives we build to help win the class war.

The struggle **against** capitalism and statism requires that we build
**for** the future and, moreover, we should remember that *"he who has
no confidence in the creative capacity of the masses and in their
capability to revolt doesn't belong in the revolutionary movement. He
should go to a monastery and get on his knees and start praying. Because
he is no revolutionist. He is a son of a bitch."* [Sam Dolgoff, quoted
by Ulrike Heider, **Anarchism: left, right, and green**, p. 12]
