C.2 Why is capitalism exploitative?
===================================

For anarchists, capitalism is marked by the exploitation of labour by
capital. While this is most famously expressed by Proudhon's
***"property is theft,"*** this perspective can be found in all forms of
anarchism. For Bakunin, capitalism was marked by an *"economic
relationship between the exploiter and exploited"* as it meant the few
have *"the power and right to live by exploiting the labour of someone
else, the right to exploit the labour of those who possess neither
property nor capital and who thus are forced to sell their productive
power to the lucky owners of both."* [**The Political Philosophy of
Bakunin**, p. 183] This means that when a worker *"sells his labour to
an employee . . . some part of the value of his produce will be unjustly
taken by the employer."* [Kropotkin, **Anarchism and
Anarchist-Communism**, p. 52]

At the root this criticism is based, ironically enough, on the
**capitalist** defence of private property as the product of labour. As
noted in [section B.4.2](secB4.html#secb42), Locke defended private
property in terms of labour yet allowed that labour to be sold to
others. This allowed the buyers of labour (capitalists and landlords) to
appropriate the product of other people's labour (wage workers and
tenants) and so, in the words of dissident economist David Ellerman,
*"capitalist production, i.e. production based on the employment
contract denies workers the right to the (positive and negative) fruit
of their labour. Yet people's right to the fruits of their labour has
always been the natural basis for private property appropriation. Thus
capitalist production, far from being founded on private property, in
fact denies the natural basis for private property appropriation."*
[**The Democratic worker-owned firm**, p. 59] This was expressed by
Proudhon in the following way:

> *"Whoever labours becomes a proprietor -- this is an inevitable
> deduction from the principles of political economy and jurisprudence.
> And when I say proprietor, I do not mean simply (as do our
> hypocritical economists) proprietor of his allowance, his salary, his
> wages, -- I mean proprietor of the value his creates, and by which the
> master alone profits . . . **The labourer retains, even after he has
> received his wages, a natural right in the thing he was produced.**"*
> [**What is Property?**, pp. 123-4]

In other words, taking the moral justification for capitalism,
anarchists argue that it fails to meet its own criteria (*"With me who,
as a labourer, have a right to the possession of the products of Nature
and my own industry -- and who, as a proletaire [wage labourer], enjoy
none of them."* [Proudhon, **Op. Cit.**, p. 65]). Whether this principle
should be applied in a free society is a moot point within anarchism.
Individualist and mutualist anarchists argue it should be and,
therefore, say that individual workers should receive the product of
their toil (and so argue for distribution according to deed).
Communist-anarchists argue that *"social ownership and sharing according
to need . . . would be the best and most just economic arrangement."*
This is for two reasons. Firstly, because *"in modern industry"* there
is *"no such thing"* as an individual product as *"all labour and the
products of labour are social."* [Berkman, **What is Anarchism?**, pp.
169-70] Secondly, in terms of simple justice need is not related to the
ability to work and, of course, it would be wrong to penalise those who
cannot work (i.e. the sick, the young and the old). Yet, while
anarchists disagree over exactly how this should be most justly
realised, they all agree that labour should control **all** that it
produces (either individually or collectively) and, consequently,
non-labour income is exploitation (it should be stressed that as both
schemes are voluntary, there is no real contradiction between them).
Anarchists tend to call non-labour income "surplus-value" or "usury" and
these terms are used to group together profits, rent and interest (see
[section C.2.1](secC2.html#secc21) for details).

That this critique is a problem for capitalism can be seen from the many
varied and wonderful defences created by economists to justify
non-labour income. Economists, at least in the past, saw the problem
clear enough. John Stuart Mill, the final great economist of the
classical school, presented the typical moral justification of
capitalism, along with the problems it causes. As he explains in his
classic introduction to economics, the *"institution of property, when
limited to its essential elements, consists in the recognition, in each
person, of a right to the exclusive disposal of what he or she have
produced by their own exertions . . . The foundation of the whole is,
the right of producers to what they themselves have produced."* He then
notes the obvious contradiction -- workers do **not** receive what they
have produced. Thus it *"may be objected"* that capitalist society
*"recognises rights of property in individuals over which they have not
produced,"* for example *"the operatives in a manufactory create, by
their labour and skill, the whole produce; yet, instead of it belonging
to them, the law gives them only their stipulated hire [wages], and
transfers the produce to someone who has merely supplied the funds,
without perhaps contributing to the work itself."* [**Principles of
Political Economy**, p. 25] With the rise of neoclassical economics, the
problem remained and so did need to justify capitalism continued to
drive economics. J. B. Clark, for example, knew what was at stake and,
like Mill, expressed it:

> *"When a workman leaves the mill, carrying his pay in his pocket, the
> civil law guarantees to him what he thus takes away; but before he
> leaves the mill he is the rightful owner of a part of the wealth that
> the day's industry has brought forth. Does the economic law which, in
> some way that he does not understand, determines what his pay shall
> be, make it to correspond with the amount of his portion of the day's
> product, or does it force him to leave some of his rightful share
> behind him? A plan of living that should force men to leave in their
> employer's hands anything that by right of creation is theirs, would
> be an institutional robbery -- a legally established violation of the
> principle on which property is supposed to rest."* [**The Distribution
> of Wealth**, pp. 8-9]

Why should the owners of land, money and machinery get an income in the
first place? Capitalist economics argues that everything involves a cost
and, as such, people should be rewarded for the sacrifices they suffer
when they contribute to production. Labour, in this schema, is
considered a cost to those who labour and, consequently, they should be
rewarded for it. Labour is thought of a disutility, i.e. something
people do not want, rather than something with utility, i.e. something
people do want. Under capitalism (like any class system), this
perspective makes some sense as workers are bossed about and often
subject to long and difficult labour. Most people will happily agree
that labour is an obvious cost and should be rewarded.

Economists, unsurprisingly, have tended to justify surplus value by
arguing that it involves as much cost and sacrifice as labour. For Mill,
labour *"cannot be carried on without materials and machinery . . . All
these things are the fruits of previous production. If the labourers
possessed of them, they would not need to divide the produce with any
one; but while they have them not, an equivalent must be given to those
who have."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 25] This rationale for profits is called
the "abstinence" or "waiting" theory. Clark, like Mill, expressed a
defence of non-labour income in the face of socialist and anarchist
criticism, namely the idea of marginal productivity to explain and
justify non-labour income. Other theories have been developed as the
weaknesses of previous ones have been exposed and we will discuss some
of them in subsequent sections.

The ironic thing is that, well over 200 years after it came of age with
Adam Smith's **Wealth of Nations**, economics has no agreed explanation
for the source of surplus value. As dissident economists Michele I.
Naples and Nahid Aslanbeigui show, introductory economics texts provide
*"no consistent, widely accepted theory"* on the profit rate. Looking at
the top three introductions to economics, they discovered that there was
a *"strange amalgam"* of theories which is *"often confusing, incomplete
and inconsistent."* Given that internal consistency is usually heralded
as one of the hallmarks of neoclassical theory, *"the theory must be
questioned."* This *"failure . . . to provide a coherent theory of the
rate of profit in the short run or long run"* is damning, as the
*"absence of a coherent explanation for the profit rate represents a
fundamental failure for the neoclassical model."* [*"What **does**
determine the profit rate? The neoclassical theories present in
introductory textbooks,"* pp. 53-71, **Cambridge Journal of Economics**,
vol. 20, p. 53, p. 54, p. 69 and p. 70]

As will become clear, anarchists consider defences of *"surplus value"*
to be essentially ideological and without an empirical base. As we will
attempt to indicate, capitalists are not justified in appropriating
surplus value from workers for no matter how this appropriation is
explained by capitalist economics, we find that inequality in wealth and
power are the real reasons for this appropriation rather than some
actual productive act on the part of capitalists, investors or
landlords. Mainstream economic theories generally seek to justify the
distribution of income and wealth rather than to understand it. They are
parables about what should be rather than what is. We argue that any
scientific analysis of the source of *"surplus value"* cannot help
conclude that it is due, primarily, to inequalities of wealth and,
consequently, inequalities of power on the market. In other words, that
Rousseau was right:

> *"The terms of social compact between these two estates of men may be
> summed up in a few words: 'You have need of me, because I am rich and
> you are poor. We will therefore come to an agreement. I will permit
> you to have the honour of serving me, on condition that you bestow on
> me that little you have left, in return for the pains I shall take to
> command you.'"* [**The Social Contract and Discourses**, p. 162]

This is the analysis of exploitation we present in more detail in
[section C.2.2](secC2.html#secc22). To summarise it, labour faces social
inequality when it passes from the market to production. In the
workplace, capitalists exercise social power over how labour is used and
this allows them to produce more value from the productive efforts of
workers than they pay for in wages. This social power is rooted in
social dependence, namely the fact that workers have little choice but
to sell their liberty to those who own the means of life. To ensure the
creation and appropriation of surplus-value, capitalists must not only
own the production process and the product of the workers' labour, they
must own the labour of the workers itself. In other words, they must
control the workers. Hence capitalist production must be, to use
Proudhon's term, *"despotism."* How much surplus-value can be produced
depends on the relative economic power between bosses and workers as
this determines the duration of work and the intensity of labour,
however its roots are the same -- the hierarchical and class nature of
capitalist society.

C.2.1 What is *"surplus value"*?
--------------------------------

Before discussing how surplus-value exists and the flaws in capitalist
defences of it, we need to be specific about what we mean by the term
**"surplus value."** To do this we must revisit the difference between
possession and private property we discussed in [section
B.3](secB3.html). For anarchists, private property (or capital) is *"the
power to produce without labour."* [Proudhon, **What is Property?**, p.
161] As such, surplus value is created when the owners of property let
others use them and receive an income from so doing. Therefore something
only becomes capital, producing surplus value, under specific social
relationships.

Surplus value is *"the difference between the value produced by the
workers and the wages they receive"* and is *"appropriated by the
landlord and capitalist class . . . absorbed by the non-producing
classes as profits, interest, rent, etc."* [Charlotte Wilson,
**Anarchist Essays**, pp. 46-7] It basically refers to any non-labour
income (some anarchists, particularly individualist anarchists, have
tended to call *"surplus value"* usury). As Proudhon noted, it
*"receives different names according to the thing by which it is
yielded: if by land, **ground-rent**; if by houses and furniture,
**rent**; if by life-investments, **revenue**; if by money,
**interest**; if by exchange, **advantage**, **gain**, **profit** (three
things which must not be confounded with the wages of legitimate price
of labour)."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 159]

For simplicity, we will consider *"surplus value"* to have three
component parts: profits, interest and rent. All are based on payment
for letting someone else use your property. Rent is what we pay to be
allowed to exist on part of the earth (or some other piece of property).
Interest is what we pay for the use of money. Profit is what we pay to
be allowed to work a farm or use piece of machinery. Rent and interest
are easy to define, they are obviously the payment for using someone
else's property and have existed long before capitalism appeared. Profit
is a somewhat more complex economic category although, ultimately, is
still a payment for using someone else's property.

The term "profit" is often used simply, but incorrectly, to mean an
excess over costs. However, this ignores the key issue, namely how a
workplace is organised. In a co-operative, for example, while there is a
surplus over costs, *"there is no profit, only income to be divided
among members. Without employees the labour-managed firm does not have a
wage bill, and labour costs are not counted among the expenses to be
extracted from profit, as they are in the capitalist firm."* This means
that the *"**economic category of profit does not exist in the
labour-managed firm,** as it does in the capitalist firm where wages are
a cost to be subtracted from gross income before a residual profit is
determined . . . Income shared among all producers is net income
generated by the firm: the total of value added by human labour applied
to the means of production, less payment of all costs of production and
any reserves for depreciation of plant and equipment."* [Christopher
Eaton Gunn, **Workers' Self-Management in the United States**, p. 41 and
p. 45] Gunn, it should be noted, follows both Proudhon and Marx in his
analysis (*"Let us suppose the workers are themselves in possession of
their respective means of production and exchange their commodities with
one another. These commodities would not be products of capital."*
[Marx, **Capital**, vol. 3, p. 276]).

In other words, by profits we mean income that flows to the owner of a
workplace or land who hires others to do the work. As such returns to
capital are as unique to capitalism as unemployment is. This means that
a farmer who works their own land receives a labour income when they
sell the crop while one who hires labourers to work the land will
receives a non-labour income, profit. Hence the difference between
***possession*** and ***private property*** (or ***capital***) and
anarchist opposition to *"capitalist property, that is, property which
allows some to live by the work of others and which therefore
presupposes a class of . . . people, obliged to sell their labour power
to the property-owners for less than its value."* [Malatesta, **Errico
Malatesta: His Life and Ideas**, p. 102]

Another complication arises due to the fact that the owners of private
property sometimes do work on them (i.e. be a boss) or hire others to do
boss-like work on their behalf (i.e. executives and other managerial
staff). It could be argued that bosses and executives are also
*"workers"* and so contribute to the value of the commodities produced.
However, this is not the case. Exploitation does not just happen, it
needs to be organised and managed. In other words, exploitation requires
labour (*"There is work and there is work,"* as Bakunin noted, *"There
is productive labour and there is the labour of exploitation."* [**The
Political Philosophy of Bakunin**, p. 180]). The key is that while a
workplace would grind to a halt without workers, the workers could
happily do without a boss by organising themselves into an association
to manage their own work. As such, while bosses may work, they are not
taking part in productive activity but rather exploitative activity.

Much the same can be said of executives and managers. Though they may
not own the instruments of production, they are certainly buyers and
controllers of labour power, and under their auspices production is
still **capitalist** production. The creation of a "salary-slave" strata
of managers does not alter the capitalist relations of production. In
effect, the management strata are **de facto** capitalists and they are
like "working capitalist" and, consequently, their "wages" come from the
surplus value appropriated from workers and realised on the market. Thus
the exploitative role of managers, even if they can be fired, is no
different from capitalists. Moreover, *"shareholders and
managers/technocrats share common motives: to make profits and to
reproduce hierarchy relations that exclude most of the employees from
effective decision making"* [Takis Fotopoulos, *"The Economic
Foundations of an Ecological Society"*, pp. 1-40, **Society and
Nature**, No.3, p. 16] In other words, the high pay of the higher levels
of management is a share of profits **not** a labour income based on
their contribution to production but rather due to their position in the
economic hierarchy and the power that gives them.

So management is paid well because they monopolise power in the company
and can get away with it. As Bakunin argued, within the capitalist
workplace *"administrative work . . . [is] monopolised . . . if I
concentrate in my hands the administrative power, it is not because the
interests of production demand it, but in order to serve my own ends,
the ends of exploitation. As absolute boss of my establishment I get for
my labours [many] . . . times more than my workers get for theirs."*
[**Op. Cit.**, p. 186] Given this, it is irrelevant whether those in the
hierarchy simply control (in the case of managers) or actually own the
means of production. What counts is that those who do the actual work
are excluded from the decision making process.

This is not to say that 100 percent of what managers do is exploitative.
The case is complicated by the fact that there is a legitimate need for
co-ordination between various aspects of complex production processes --
a need that would remain under libertarian socialism and would be filled
by elected and recallable (and in some cases rotating) managers (see
[section I.3](secI3.html)). But under capitalism, managers become
parasitic in proportion to their proximity to the top of the pyramid. In
fact, the further the distance from the production process, the higher
the salary; whereas the closer the distance, the more likely that a
"manager" is a worker with a little more power than average. In
capitalist organisations, the less you do, the more you get. In
practice, executives typically call upon subordinates to perform
managerial (i.e. co-ordinating) functions and restrict themselves to
broader policy-making decisions. As their decision-making power comes
from the hierarchical nature of the firm, they could be easily replaced
if policy making was in the hands of those who are affected by it. As
such, their role as managers do not require them to make vast sums. They
are paid that well currently because they monopolise power in the
company and can, consequently, get away with deciding that they,
unsurprisingly, contribute most to the production of useful goods rather
than those who do the actual work.

Nor are we talking, as such, of profits generated by buying cheap and
selling dear. We are discussing the situation at the level of the
economy as a whole, **not** individual transactions. The reason is
obvious. If profits could just explained in terms of buying cheap in
order to sell dear then, over all, such transactions would cancel each
other out when we look at the market as a whole as any profit will
cancel any loss. For example, if someone buys a product at, say, £20 and
sells it at £25 then there would be no surplus overall as someone else
will have to pay £20 for something which cost £25. In other words, what
one person gains as a seller, someone else will lose as a buyer and no
net surplus has been created. Capitalists, in other words, do not simply
profit at each other's expense. There is a creation of surplus rather
than mere redistribution of a given product. This means that we are
explaining why production results in a aggregate surplus and why it gets
distributed between social classes under capitalism.

This means that capitalism is based on the creation of surplus rather
than mere redistribution of a given sum of products. If this were not
the case then the amount of goods in the economy would not increase,
growth would not exist and all that would happen is that the
distribution of goods would change, depending on the transactions made.
Such a world would be one without production and, consequently, not
realistic. Unsurprisingly, as we noted in [section C.1](secC1.html),
this is the world of neoclassical economics. This shows the weakness of
attempts to explain the source of profits in terms of the market rather
than production. While the market can explain how, perhaps, a specific
set of goods and surplus is distributed, it cannot explain how a surplus
is generated in the first place. To understand how a surplus is created
we need to look at the process of value creation. For this, it is
necessary to look at production to see if there is something which
produces more than it gets paid for. Anarchists, like other socialists,
argue that this is labour and, consequently, that capitalism is an
exploitative system. We discuss why in the [next
section](secC2.html#secc22).

Obviously, pro-capitalist economics argues against this theory of how a
surplus arises and the conclusion that capitalism is exploitative. We
will discuss the more common arguments below. However, one example will
suffice here to see why labour is the source of a surplus, rather than
(say) "waiting", risk or the productivity of capital (to list some of
the more common explanations for capitalist appropriation of surplus
value). This is a card game. A good poker-player uses equipment
(capital), takes risks, delays gratification, engages in strategic
behaviour, tries new tricks (innovates), not to mention cheats, and can
make large winnings. However, no surplus product results from such
behaviour; the gambler's winnings are simply redistributions from others
with no new production occurring. For one to win, the rest must lose.
Thus risk-taking, abstinence, entrepreneurship, and so on might be
necessary for an individual to receive profits but they are far from
sufficient for them not to be the result a pure redistribution from
others.

In short, our discussion of exploitation under capitalism is first and
foremost an economy-wide one. We are concentrating on how value (goods
and services) and surplus value (profits, rent and interest) are
produced rather than how they are distributed. The distribution of goods
between people and the division of income into wages and surplus value
between classes is a secondary concern as this can only occur under
capitalism if workers produce goods and services to sell (this is the
direct opposite of mainstream economics which assumes a static economy
with almost no discussion of how scarce means are organised to yield
outputs, the whole emphasis is on exchanges of ready made goods).

Nor is this distribution somehow fixed. As we discuss in [section
C.3](secC3.html), how the amount of value produced by workers is divided
between wages and surplus value is source of much conflict and struggle,
the outcome of which depends on the balance of power between and within
classes. The same can be said of surplus value. This is divided between
profits, interest and rent -- capitalists, financiers and landlords.
This does not imply that these sections of the exploiting class see eye
to eye or that there is not competition between them. Struggle goes on
within classes and well as between classes and this applies at the top
of the economic hierarchy as at the bottom. The different sections of
the ruling elite fight over their share of surplus value. This can
involve fighting over control of the state to ensure that their
interests are favoured over others. For example, the Keynesian post-war
period can be considered a period when industrial capitalists shaped
state policy while the period after 1973 represents a shift in power
towards finance capital.

We must stress, therefore, that the exploitation of workers is not
defined as payment less than competitive ("free market") for their
labour. Rather, exploitation occurs even if they are paid the market
wage. This is because workers are paid for their ability to labour
(their *"labour-power,"* to use Marx's term) rather the labour itself.
This means that for a given hour's work (labour), the capitalist expects
the worker to produce more than their wage (labour power). How much more
is dependent on the class struggle and the objective circumstances each
side faces. Indeed, a rebellious workforce willing to take direct action
in defence of their interests will not allow subjection or its resulting
exploitation.

Similarly, it would be wrong to confuse exploitation with low wages.
Yes, exploitation is often associated with paying low wages but it is
more than possible for real wages to go up while the rate of
exploitation falls or rises. While some anarchists in the nineteenth
century did argue that capitalism was marked by falling real wages, this
was more a product of the time they were living through rather than an
universal law. Most anarchists today argue that whether wages rise or
fall depends on the social and economic power of working people and the
historic context of a given society. This means, in other words, that
labour is exploited not because workers have a low standard of living
(although it can) but because labour produces the whole of the value
created in any process of production or creation of a service but gets
only part of it back.

As such, it does not matter **if** real wages do go up or not. Due to
the accumulation of capital, the social and economic power of the
capitalists and their ability to extract surplus-value can go up at a
higher rate than real wages. The key issue is one of freedom rather than
the possibility of consuming more. Bosses are in a position, due to the
hierarchical nature of the capitalist workplace, to make workers produce
more than they pay them in wages. The absolute level of those wages is
irrelevant to the creation and appropriation of value and surplus-value
as this happens at all times within capitalism.

As an example, since the 1970s American workers have seen their wages
stagnate and have placed themselves into more and more debt to maintain
an expected standard of living. During this time, productivity has
increased and so they have been increasingly exploited. However, between
1950s and 1970s wages did increase along with productivity. Strong
unions and a willingness to strike mitigated exploitation and increased
living standards but exploitation continued. As Doug Henwood notes,
while *"average incomes have risen considerably"* since 1945, *"the
amount of work necessary to earn those incomes has risen with equal
relentlessness . . . So, despite the fact that productivity overall is
up more than threefold"* over this time *"the average worker would have
to toil six months longer to make the average family income."* [**After
the New Economy**, pp. 39-40] In other words, rising exploitation
**can** go hand in hand with rising wages.

Finally, we must stress that we are critiquing economics mostly in its
own terms. On average workers sell their labour-power at a "fair" market
price and still exploitation occurs. As sellers of a commodity
(labour-power) they do not receive its full worth (i.e. what they
actually produce). Even if they did, almost all anarchists would still
be against the system as it is based on the worker becoming a wage-slave
and subject to hierarchy. In other words, they are not free during
production and, consequently, they would still being robbed, although
this time it is as human beings rather than a factor of production (i.e.
they are oppressed rather than exploited). As Bookchin put it:

> *"To the modern mind, labour is viewed as a rarefied, abstract
> activity, a process extrinsic to human notions of genuine
> self-actualisation. One usually 'goes to work' the way a condemned
> person 'goes' to a place of confinement: the workplace is little more

Almost all anarchists seek to change this, combat oppression and
alienation as well as exploitation (some individualist anarchists are
the exception on this issue). Needless to say, the idea that we could be
subject to oppression during working hours and ***not*** be exploited is
one most anarchists would dismiss as a bad joke and, as a result, follow
Proudhon and demand the abolition of wage labour (most take it further
and advocate the abolition of the wages system as well, i.e. support
libertarian communism).

C.2.2 How does exploitation happen?
-----------------------------------

In order to make more money, money must be transformed into capital,
i.e., workplaces, machinery and other *"capital goods."* By itself,
however, capital (like money) produces nothing. While a few even talk
about *"making money work for you"* (as if pieces of paper can actually
do any form of work!) obviously this is not the case -- human beings
have to do the actual work. As Kropotkin put it, *"if [the capitalist]
locks [his money] up, it will not increase, because [it] does not grow
like seed, and after a lapse of a twelve month he will not find £110 in
his drawer if he only put £100 into it.* [**The Place of Anarchism in
Socialistic Evolution**, p. 4] Capital only becomes productive in the
labour process when workers use it:

> *"Values created by net product are classed as savings and capitalised
> in the most highly exchangeable form, the form which is freest and
> least susceptible of depreciation, -- in a word, the form of specie,
> the only constituted value. Now, if capital leaves this state of
> freedom and **engages itself**, -- that is, takes the form of
> machines, buildings, etc., -- it will still be susceptible of
> exchange, but much more exposed than before to the oscillations of
> supply and demand. Once engaged, it cannot be **disengaged** without
> difficulty; and the sole resource of its owner will be exploitation.
> Exploitation alone is capable of maintaining engaged capital at its
> nominal value."* [**System of Economical Contradictions**, p. 291]

Under capitalism, workers not only create sufficient value (i.e.
produced commodities) to maintain existing capital and their own
existence, they also produce a surplus. This surplus expresses itself as
a surplus of goods and services, i.e. an excess of commodities compared
to the number a workers' wages could buy back. The wealth of the
capitalists, in other words, is due to them *"accumulating the product
of the labour of others."* [Kropotkin, **Op. Cit.**, p. 3] Thus
Proudhon:

> *"The working man cannot . . . repurchase that which he has produced
> for his master. It is thus with all trades whatsoever. . . since,
> producing for a master who in one form or another makes a profit, they
> are obliged to pay more for their own labour than they get for it."*
> [**What is Property**, p. 189]

In other words, the price of all produced goods is greater than the
money value represented by the workers' wages (plus raw materials and
overheads such as wear and tear on machinery) when those goods were
produced. The labour contained in these "surplus-products" is the source
of profit, which has to be realised on the market (in practice, of
course, the value represented by these surplus-products is distributed
throughout all the commodities produced in the form of profit -- the
difference between the cost price and the market price). In summary,
surplus value is unpaid labour and hence capitalism is based on
exploitation. As Proudhon noted, *"**Products,** say economists, **are
only bought by products**. This maxim is property's condemnation. The
proprietor producing neither by his own labour nor by his implement, and
receiving products in exchange for nothing, is either a parasite or a
thief."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 170]

It is this appropriation of wealth from the worker by the owner which
differentiates capitalism from the simple commodity production of
artisan and peasant economies. All anarchists agree with Bakunin when he
stated that:

> *"**what is property, what is capital in their present form?** For the
> capitalist and the property owner they mean the power and the right,
> guaranteed by the State, to live without working . . . [and so] the
> power and right to live by exploiting the work of someone else . . .
> those . . . [who are] forced to sell their productive power to the
> lucky owners of both."* [**The Political Philosophy of Bakunin**, p.
> 180]

It is the nature of capitalism for the monopolisation of the worker's
product by others to exist. This is because of private property in the
means of production and so in *"consequence of [which] . . . [the]
worker, when he is able to work, finds no acre to till, no machine to
set in motion, unless he agrees to sell his labour for a sum inferior to
its real value."* [Peter Kropotkin, **Anarchism**, p. 55]

Therefore workers have to sell their labour on the market. However, as
this "commodity" *"cannot be separated from the person of the worker
like pieces of property. The worker's capacities are developed over time
and they form an integral part of his self and self-identity; capacities
are internally not externally related to the person. Moreover,
capacities or labour power cannot be used without the worker using his
will, his understanding and experience, to put them into effect. The use
of labour power requires the presence of its 'owner'. . . To contract
for the use of labour power is a waste of resources unless it can be
used in the way in which the new owner requires . . . The employment
contract must, therefore, create a relationship of command and obedience
between employer and worker."* So, *"the contract in which the worker
allegedly sells his labour power is a contract in which, since he cannot
be separated from his capacities, he sells command over the use of his
body and himself. . . The characteristics of this condition are captured
in the term **wage slave.**"* [Carole Pateman, **The Sexual Contract**,
pp. 150-1]

Or, to use Bakunin's words, *"the worker sells his person and his
liberty for a given time"* and so *"concluded for a term only and
reserving to the worker the right to quit his employer, this contract
constitutes a sort of **voluntary** and **transitory** serfdom."* [**The
Political Philosophy of Bakunin**, p. 187] This domination is the source
of the surplus, for *"wage slavery is not a consequence of exploitation
-- exploitation is a consequence of the fact that the sale of labour
power entails the worker's subordination. The employment contract
creates the capitalist as master; he has the political right to
determine how the labour of the worker will be used, and -- consequently
-- can engage in exploitation."* [Pateman, **Op. Cit.**, p. 149]

So profits exist because the worker sells themselves to the capitalist,
who then owns their activity and, therefore, controls them (or, more
accurately, **tries** to control them) like a machine. Benjamin Tucker's
comments with regard to the claim that capital is entitled to a reward
are of use here. He notes that some *"combat. . . the doctrine that
surplus value -- oftener called profits -- belong to the labourer
because he creates it, by arguing that the horse. . . is rightly
entitled to the surplus value which he creates for his owner. So he will
be when he has the sense to claim and the power to take it. . . Th[is]
argument . . is based upon the assumption that certain men are born
owned by other men, just as horses are. Thus its **reductio ad
absurdum** turns upon itself."* [**Instead of a Book**, pp. 495-6] In
other words, to argue that capital should be rewarded is to implicitly
assume that workers are just like machinery, another "factor of
production" rather than human beings and the creator of things of value.
So profits exists because during the working day the capitalist controls
the activity and output of the worker (i.e. owns them during working
hours as activity cannot be separated from the body and *"[t]here is an
integral relationship between the body and self. The body and self are
not identical, but selves are inseparable from bodies."* [Carole
Pateman, **Op. Cit.**, p. 206]).

Considered purely in terms of output, this results in, as Proudhon
noted, workers working *"for an entrepreneur who pays them and keeps
their products."* [quoted by Martin Buber, **Paths in Utopia**, p. 29]
The ability of capitalists to maintain this kind of monopolisation of
another's time and output is enshrined in *"property rights"* enforced
by either public or private states. In short, therefore, property *"is
the right to enjoy and dispose at will of another's goods - the fruit of
an other's industry and labour."* [P-J Proudhon, **What is Property**,
p. 171] And because of this "right," a worker's wage will always be less
than the wealth that he or she produces.

The surplus value produced by labour is divided between profits,
interest and rent (or, more correctly, between the owners of the various
factors of production other than labour). In practice, this surplus is
used by the owners of capital for: (a) investment (b) to pay themselves
dividends on their stock, if any; (c) to pay for rent and interest
payments; and (d) to pay their executives and managers (who are
sometimes identical with the owners themselves) much higher salaries
than workers. As the surplus is being divided between different groups
of capitalists, this means that there can be clashes of interest between
(say) industrial capitalists and finance capitalists. For example, a
rise in interest rates can squeeze industrial capitalists by directing
more of the surplus from them into the hands of rentiers. Such a rise
could cause business failures and so a slump (indeed, rising interest
rates is a key way of regulating working class power by generating
unemployment to discipline workers by fear of the sack). The surplus,
like the labour used to reproduce existing capital, is embodied in the
finished commodity and is realised once it is sold. This means that
workers do not receive the full value of their labour, since the surplus
appropriated by owners for investment, etc. represents value added to
commodities by workers -- value for which they are not paid nor control.

The size of this surplus, the amount of unpaid labour, can be changed by
changing the duration and intensity of work (i.e. by making workers
labour longer and harder). If the duration of work is increased, the
amount of surplus value is increased absolutely. If the intensity is
increased, e.g. by innovation in the production process, then the amount
of surplus value increases relatively (i.e. workers produce the
equivalent of their wage sooner during their working day resulting in
more unpaid labour for their boss). Introducing new machinery, for
example, increases surplus-value by reducing the amount of work required
per unit of output. In the words of economist William Lazonick:

> "As a general rule, all market prices, including wages, are given to
> the particular capitalist. Moreover, in a competitive world a
> particular capitalist cannot retain privileged access to process or
> product innovations for any appreciable period of time. But the

> value-added by and the value paid to the worker. As owner of the means
> of production, the industrial capitalist has a legal right to keep the
> surplus-value for himself." [**Competitive Advantage on the Shop
> Floor**, p. 54]

Such surplus indicates that labour, like any other commodity, has a use
value and an exchange value. Labour's exchange value is a worker's
wages, its use value their ability to work, to do what the capitalist
who buys it wants. Thus the existence of "surplus products" indicates
that there is a difference between the exchange value of labour and its
use value, that labour can **potentially** create **more** value than it
receives back in wages. We stress potentially, because the extraction of
use value from labour is not a simple operation like the extraction of
so many joules of energy from a ton of coal. Labour power cannot be used
without subjecting the labourer to the will of the capitalist - unlike
other commodities, labour power remains inseparably embodied in human
beings. Both the extraction of use value and the determination of
exchange value for labour depends upon - and are profoundly modified by
- the actions of workers. Neither the effort provided during an hours
work, nor the time spent in work, nor the wage received in exchange for
it, can be determined without taking into account the worker's
resistance to being turned into a commodity, into an order taker. In
other words, the amount of "surplus products" extracted from a worker is
dependent upon the resistance to dehumanisation within the workplace, to
the attempts by workers to resist the destruction of liberty during work
hours.

Thus unpaid labour, the consequence of the authority relations explicit
in private property, is the source of profits. Part of this surplus is
used to enrich capitalists and another to increase capital, which in
turn is used to increase profits, in an endless cycle (a cycle, however,
which is not a steady increase but is subject to periodic disruption by
recessions or depressions - "The business cycle." The basic causes for
such crises will be discussed later, in sections [C.7](secC7.html) and
[C.8](secC8.html)).

It should be noted that few economists deny that the "value added" by
workers in production must exceed the wages paid. It has to, if a profit
is to be made. As Adam Smith put it:

> *"As soon as stock has accumulated in the hands of particular persons,
> some of them will naturally employ it in setting to work industrious
> people, whom they will supply with materials and subsistence, in order
> to make a profit by the sale of their work, or by what their labour
> adds to the value of the materials . . . The value which the workmen
> add to the materials, therefore, resolves itself in this case into two
> parts, of which one pays their wages, the other the profits of their
> employer upon the whole stock of materials and wages which he
> advanced. He could have no interest to employ them, unless he expected
> from the sale of their work something more than what was sufficient to
> replace his stock to him."* [**The Wealth of Nations**, p. 42]

That surplus value consists of unpaid labour is a simple fact. The
difference is that non-socialist economists refuse to explain this in
terms of exploitation. Like Smith, David Ricardo argued in a similar
manner and justified surplus value appropriation in spite of this
analysis. Faced with the obvious interpretation of non-labour income as
exploitation which could easily be derived from classical economics,
subsequent economists have sought to obscure this fact and have produced
a series of rationales to justify the appropriation of workers labour by
capitalists. In other words, to explain and justify the fact that
capitalism is not based on its own principle that labour creates and
justifies property. These rationales have developed over time, usually
in response to socialist and anarchist criticism of capitalism and its
economics (starting in response to the so-called Ricardian Socialists
who predated Proudhon and Marx and who first made such an analysis
commonplace). These have been based on many factors, such as the
abstinence or waiting by the capitalist, the productivity of capital,
"time-preference," entrepreneurialism and so forth. We discuss most
rationales and indicate their weaknesses in subsequent sections.

C.2.3 Is owning capital sufficient reason to justify profits?
-------------------------------------------------------------

No, it does not. To understand why, we must first explain the logic
behind this claim. It is rooted in what is termed "marginal
productivity" theory. In the words of one of its developers:

> *"If each productive function is paid for according to the amount of
> its product, then each man get what he himself produces. If he works,
> he gets what he creates by working; if he provides capital, he gets
> what his capital produces; and if, further, he renders service by
> co-ordinating labour and capital, he gets the product that can be
> separately traced to that function. Only in one of these ways can a
> man produce anything. If he receives all that he brings into existence
> through any one of these three functions, he receives all that he
> creates at all."* [John Bates Clark, **The Distribution of Wealth**,
> p.7]

Needless to say, this analysis was based on the need to justify the
existing system, for it was *"the purpose of this work to show that the
distribution of income to society is controlled by a natural law, and
that this law, if it worked without friction, would give to every agent
of production the amount of wealth which that agent creates."* In other
words, *"what a social class gets is, under natural law, what it
contributes to the general output of industry."* [Clark, **Op. Cit.**,
p. v and p. 313] And only mad people can reject a *"natural law"* like
gravity -- or capitalism!

Most schools of capitalist economics, when they bother to try and
justify non-labour income, hold to this theory of productivity.
Unsurprisingly, as it proves what right-wing economist Milton Friedman
called the *"capitalist ethic"*: *"To each according to what he and the
instruments he owns produces."* [**Capitalism and Freedom**, pp.
161-162] As such, this is one of the key defences of capitalism, based
as it is on the productive contribution of each factor (labour, land and
capital). Anarchists as unconvinced.

Unsurprisingly, this theory took some time to develop given the
theoretical difficulties involved. After all, you need all three factors
to produce a commodity, say a bushel of wheat. How can we determine that
percentage of the price is due to the land, what percentage to labour
and what percentage to capital? You cannot simply say that the
"contribution" of each factor just happens to be identical to its cost
(i.e. the contribution of land is what the market rent is) as this is
circular reasoning. So how is it possible to specify contribution of
each factor of production independently of the market mechanism in such
a way as to show, firstly, that the contributions add up to 100 percent
and, secondly, that the free market will in fact return to each factor
its respective contribution?

This is where marginal productivity theory comes in. In neo-classical
theory, the contribution of a specific factor is defined as the marginal
product of that factor when the other factors are left constant. Take,
as an example, a hundred bushels of wheat produced by X acres of land
being worked by Y workers using £Z worth of capital. The contribution of
land can then be defined as the increase in wheat that an extra acre of
land would produce (X+1) if the same number of workers employed the same
capital worked it. Similarly, the contribution of a worker would be the
increase that would result if an addition worker was hired (Y + 1) to
work the same land (X) with the same capital (£Z). The contribution of
capital, obviously, would be the increase in wheat produced by the same
number of workers (X) working the same amount of land (Y) using one more
unit of capital (£Z+1). Then mathematics kicks in. If enough assumptions
are made in terms of the substitutability of factors, diminishing
returns, and so forth, then a mathematical theorem (Euler's Theorem) can
be used to show that the sum of these marginal contributions would be a
hundred bushels. Applying yet more assumptions to ensure "perfect
competition" it can be mathematically proven that the rent per acre set
by this perfect market will be precisely the contribution of the land,
that the market wage will be the contribution of the worker, and the
market interest rate will be the contribution of capital. In addition,
it can be shown that any monopoly power will enable a factor owner to
receive more than it contributes, so exploiting the others.

While this is impressive, the problems are obvious. As we discuss in
[section C.2.5](secC2.html#secc25), this model does not (indeed, cannot)
describe any actual real economy. However, there is a more fundamental
issue than mere practicality or realism, namely that it confuses a
**moral** principle (that factors should receive in accordance with
their productive contributions) with an ownership issue. This is because
even if we want to say that land and capital "contribute" to the final
product, we cannot say the same for the landowner or the capitalist.
Using our example above, it should be noted that neither the capitalist
nor the landowner actually engages in anything that might be called a
productive activity. Their roles are purely passive, they simply allow
what they own to be used by the people who do the actual work, the
labourers.

Marginal productivity theory shows that with declining marginal
productivity, the contribution of labour is less than the total product.
The difference is claimed to be precisely the contribution of capital
and land. But what is this "contribution" of capital and land? Without
any labourers there would be no output. In addition, in physical terms,
the marginal product of, say, capital is simply the amount by which
production would decline is one piece of capital were taken out of
production. It does not reflect any productive activity whatsoever on
the part of the owner of said capital. **It does not, therefore, measure
his or her productive contribution.** In other words, capitalist
economics tries to confuse the owners of capital with the machinery they
own. Unlike labour, whose "ownership" cannot be separated from the
productive activities being done, capital and land can be rewarded
without their owners actually doing anything productive at all.

For all its amazing mathematics, the neo-classical solution fails simply
because it is not only irrelevant to reality, it is not relevant
ethically.

To see why, let us consider the case of land and labour (capital is more
complex and will be discussed in the next two sections). Marginal
productivity theory can show, given enough assumptions, that five acres
of land can produce 100 bushels of wheat with the labour of ten men and
that the contribution of land and labour are, respectively, 40 and 60
bushels each. In other words, that each worker receives a wage
representing 6 bushels of wheat while the landlord receives an income of
40 bushels. As socialist David Schweickart notes, *"we have derived both
the contribution of labour and the contribution of land from purely
technical considerations. We have made no assumptions about ownership,
competition, or any other social or political relationship. No covert
assumptions about capitalism have been smuggled into the analysis."*
[**After Capitalism**, p. 29]

Surely this means that economics has produced a defence of non-labour
income? Not so, as it ignores the key issue of what represents a valid
contribution. The conclusion that the landlord (or capitalist) is
entitled to their income *"in no way follows from the technical premises
of the argument. Suppose our ten workers had cultivated the five acres
**as a worker collective.** In this, they would receive the entire
product, all one hundred bushels, instead of sixty. Is this unfair? To
whom should the other forty bushels go? To the land, for its
'contribution'? Should the collective perhaps burn forty bushels as an
offering to the Land-God? (Is the Land-Lord the representative on Earth
of this Land-God?)."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 30] It should be noted that
Schweickart is echoing the words of Proudhon:

> *"How much does the proprietor increase the utility of his tenant's
> products? Has he ploughed, sowed, reaped, mowed, winnowed, weeded? . .
> . I admit that the land is an implement; but who made it? Did the

> will consider the matter with him; or even when the proprietor -- his
> pretended representative -- shall exhibit his power of attorney."*
> [**What is Property?**, pp. 166-7]

In other words, granting permission cannot be considered as a
"contribution" or a "productive" act:

> *"We can see that a moral sleight-of-hand has been performed. A
> technical demonstration has passed itself off as a moral argument by
> its choice of terminology, namely, by calling a marginal product a

> continue to 'contribute' year after year (lifting not a finger), and
> be rewarded year after year for doing so."* [Schweickart, **Op.
> Cit.**, p. 30]

As the examples of the capitalist and co-operative farms shows, the
"contribution" of land and capital can be rewarded without their owners
doing anything at all. So what does it mean, "capital's share"? After
all, no one has ever given money to a machine or land. That money goes
to the owner, not the technology or resource used. When "land" gets its
"reward" it involves money going to the landowner **not** fertiliser
being spread on the land. Equally, if the land and the capital were
owned by the labourers then "capital" and "land" would receive nothing
despite both being used in the productive process and, consequently,
having "aided" production. Which shows the fallacy of the idea that
profits, interest and rent represent a form of "contribution" to the
productive process by land and capital which needs rewarded. They only
get a "reward" when they hire labour to work them, i.e. they give
permission for others to use the property in question in return for
telling them what to do and keeping the product of their labour.

As Proudhon put it, *"[w]ho is entitled to the rent of the land? The
producer of the land, without doubt. Who made the land? God. Then,
proprietor, retire!"* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 104] Much the same can be said
of "capital" (workplaces, machinery, etc.) as well. The capitalist,
argued Berkman, *"gives you a job; that is permission to work in the
factory or mill which was not built by him but by other workers like
yourself. And for that permission you help to support him for the rest
of your life or as long as you work for him."* [**What is Anarchism?**,
p. 14]

So non-labour income exists **not** because of the owners of capital and
land "contribute" to production but because they, as a class, **own**
the means of life and workers have to sell their labour and liberty to
them to gain access:

> *"We cry shame on the feudal baron who forbade the peasant to turn a
> clod of earth unless he surrendered to his lord a fourth of his crop.
> We called those the barbarous times, But if the forms have changed,
> the relations have remained the same, and the worker is forced, under
> the name of free contract, to accept feudal obligations."* [Kropotkin,
> **The Conquest of Bread**, pp. 31-2]

It is capitalist property relations that allow this monopolisation of
wealth by those who own (or boss) but do not produce. The workers do not
get the full value of what they produce, nor do they have a say in how
the surplus value produced by their labour gets used (e.g. investment
decisions). Others have monopolised both the wealth produced by workers
and the decision-making power within the company. This is a private form
of taxation without representation, just as the company is a private
form of statism.

Therefore, providing capital is **not** a productive act, and keeping
the profits that are produced by those who actually do use capital is an
act of theft. This does not mean, of course, that creating capital goods
is not creative nor that it does not aid production. Far from it! But
owning the outcome of such activity and renting it does not justify
capitalism or profits. In other words, while we need machinery,
workplaces, houses and raw materials to produce goods we do **not** need
landlords and capitalists.

The problem with the capitalists' "contribution to production" argument
is that one must either assume (a) a strict definition of who is the
producer of something, in which case one must credit only the worker(s),
or (b) a looser definition based on which individuals have contributed
to the circumstances that made the productive work possible. Since the
worker's productivity was made possible in part by the use of property
supplied by the capitalist, one can thus credit the capitalist with
"contributing to production" and so claim that he or she is entitled to
a reward, i.e. profit.

However, if one assumes (b), one must then explain why the chain of
credit should stop with the capitalist. Since all human activity takes
place within a complex social network, many factors might be cited as
contributing to the circumstances that allowed workers to produce --
e.g. their upbringing and education, the contribution of other workers
in providing essential products, services and infrastructure that
permits their place of employment to operate, and so on (even the
government, which funds infrastructure and education). Certainly the
property of the capitalist contributed in this sense. But his
contribution was less important than the work of, say, the worker's
mother. Yet no capitalist, so far as we know, has proposed compensating
workers' mothers with any share of the firm's revenues, and particularly
not with a **greater** share than that received by capitalists! Plainly,
however, if they followed their own logic consistently, capitalists
would have to agree that such compensation would be fair.

In summary, while some may consider that profit is the capitalist's
"contribution" to the value of a commodity, the reality is that it is
nothing more than the reward for owning capital and giving permission
for **others** to produce using it. As David Schweickart puts it,
*"'providing capital' means nothing more than 'allowing it to be used.'
But an act of granting permission, in and of itself, is not a productive
activity. If labourers cease to labour, production ceases in any
society. But if owners cease to grant permission, production is affected
only if their **authority** over the means of production is respected."*
[**Against Capitalism**, p. 11]

This authority, as discussed earlier, derives from the coercive
mechanisms of the state, whose primary purpose is to ensure that
capitalists have this ability to grant or deny workers access to the
means of production. Therefore, not only is "providing capital" not a
productive activity, it depends on a system of organised coercion which
requires the appropriation of a considerable portion of the value
produced by labour, through taxes, and hence is actually parasitic.
Needless to say, rent can also be considered as "profit", being based
purely on "granting permission" and so not a productive activity. The
same can be said of interest, although the arguments are somewhat
different (see [section C.2.6](secC2.html#secc26)).

So, even if we assume that capital and land **are** productive, it does
not follow that owning those resources entitles the owner to an income.
However, this analysis is giving too much credit to capitalist ideology.
The simple fact is that capital is **not** productive at all. Rather,
*"capital"* only contributes to production when used by labour (land
does produce use values, of course, but these only become available once
labour is used to pick the fruit, reap the corn or dig the coal). As
such, profit is not the reward for the productivity of capital. Rather
**labour** produces the marginal productivity of capital. This is
discussed in the [next section](secC2.html#secc24).

C.2.4 Is profit the reward for the productivity of capital?
-----------------------------------------------------------

In a word, no. As Proudhon pointed out, *"Capital, tools, and machinery
are likewise unproductive. . . The proprietor who asks to be rewarded
for the use of a tool or for the productive power of his land, takes for
granted, then, that which is radically false; namely, that capital
produces by its own effort -- and, in taking pay for this imaginary
product, he literally receives something for nothing."* [**What is
Property?**, p. 169] In other words, only labour is productive and
profit is not the reward for the productivity of capital.

Needless to say, capitalist economists disagree. *"Here again the
philosophy of the economists is wanting. To defend usury they have
pretended that capital was productive, and they have changed a metaphor
into a reality,"* argued Proudhon. The socialists had *"no difficulty in
overturning their sophistry; and through this controversy the theory of
capital has fallen into such disfavour that today, in the minds of the
people, **capitalist** and **idler** are synonymous terms."* [**System
of Economical Contradictions**, p. 290]

Sadly, since Proudhon's time, the metaphor has become regained its hold,
thanks in part to neo-classical economics and the "marginal
productivity" theory. We explained this theory in the [last
section](secC2.html#secc23) as part of our discussion on why, even if we
assume that land and capital **are** productive this does not, in
itself, justify capitalist profit. Rather, profits accrue to the
capitalist simply because he or she gave their permission for others to
use their property. However, the notion that profits represent that
"productivity" of capital is deeply flawed for other reasons. The key
one is that, by themselves, capital and land produce nothing. As Bakunin
put it, *"neither property nor capital produces anything when not
fertilised by labour."* [**The Political Philosophy of Bakunin**, p.
183]

In other words, capital is "productive" simply because people use it.
This is hardly a surprising conclusion. Mainstream economics recognises
it in its own way (the standard economic terminology for this is that
*"factors usually do not work alone"*). Needless to say, the conclusions
anarchists and defenders of capitalism draw from this obvious fact are
radically different.

The standard defence of class inequalities under capitalism is that
people get rich by producing what other people want. That, however, is
hardly ever true. Under capitalism, people get rich by hiring other
people to produce what other people want or by providing land, money or
machinery to those who do the hiring. The number of people who have
became rich purely by their own labour, without employing others, is
tiny. When pressed, defenders of capitalism will admit the basic point
and argue that, in a free market, everyone gets in income what their
contribution in producing these goods indicates. Each factor of
production (land, capital and labour) is treated in the same way and
their marginal productivity indicates what their contribution to a
finished product is and so their income. Thus wages represent the
marginal productivity of labour, profit the marginal productivity of
capital and rent the marginal productivity of land. As we have used land
and labour in the [previous section](secC2.html#secc23), we will
concentrate on land and "capital" here. We must note, however, that
marginal productivity theory has immense difficulties with capital and
has been proven to be internally incoherent on this matter (see [next
section](secC2.html#secc25)). However, as mainstream economics ignores
this, so will we for the time being.

So what of the argument that profits represent the contribution of
capital? The reason why anarchists are not impressed becomes clear when
we consider ten men digging a hole with spades. Holding labour constant
means that we add spades to the mix. Each new spade increases
productivity by the same amount (because we assume that labour is
homogenous) until we reach the eleventh spade. At that point, the extra
spade lies unused and so the marginal contribution of the spade
("capital") is zero. This suggests that the socialists are correct,
capital **is** unproductive and, consequently, does not deserve any
reward for its use.

Of course, it will be pointed out that the eleventh spade cost money
and, as a result, the capitalist would have stopped at ten spades and
the marginal contribution of capital equals the amount the tenth spade
added. Yet the only reason that spade added anything to production was
because there was a worker to use it. In other words, as economist David
Ellerman stresses, the *"point is that capital itself does not 'produce'
at all; capital is used by Labour to produce the outputs . . . Labour
produces the marginal product **of capital.**"* [**Property and Contract
in Economics**, p. 204] As such, to talk of the "marginal product" of
capital is meaningless as holding labour constant is meaningless:

Therefore, the idea that profits equals the marginal productivity of
capital is hard to believe. Capital, in this perspective, is not only a
tree which bears fruit even if its owner leaves it uncultivated, it is a
tree which also picks its own fruit, prepares it and serves it for
dinner! Little wonder the classical economists (Smith, Ricardo, John
Stuart Mill) considered capital to be unproductive and explained profits
and interest in other, less obviously false, means.

Perhaps the "marginal productivity" of capital is simply what is left
over once workers have been paid their "share" of production, i.e. once
the marginal productivity of labour has been rewarded. Obviously the
marginal product of labour and capital are related. In a production
process, the contribution of capital will (by definition) be equal to
total price minus the contribution of labour. You define the marginal
product of labour, it is necessary to keep something else constant. This
means either the physical inputs other than labour are kept constant, or
the rate of profit on capital is kept constant. As economist Joan
Robinson noted:

> *"I found this satisfactory, for it destroys the doctrine that wages

> Modern Economics**, p. 104]

If wages are not regulated by marginal productivity theory, then neither
is capital (or land). Subtracting labour while keeping capital constant
simply results in unused equipment and unused equipment, by definition,
produces nothing. What the "contribution" of capital is dependent,
therefore, on the economic power the owning class has in a given market
situation (as we discuss in [section C.3](secC3.html)). As William
Lazonick notes, the neo-classical theory of marginal productivity has
two key problems which flow from its flawed metaphor that capital is
"productive":

> "The first flaw is the assumption that, at any point in time, the
> productivity of a technology is given to the firm, irrespective of the
> social context in which the firm attempts to utilise the technology .
> . . this assumption, typically implicit in mainstream economic
> analysis and [is] derived from an ignorance of the nature of the

> "The second flaw in the neo-classical theoretical structure is the

> labour inputs . . . the productivity of a technology depends on the
> amount of effort that workers choose to supply." [**Competitive
> Advantage on the Shop Floor**, p. 130 and pp. 133-4]

In other words, neo-classical economics forgets that technology has to
be used by workers and so its "productivity" depends on how it is
applied. If profit did flow as a result of some property of machinery
then bosses could do without autocratic workplace management to ensure
profits. They would have no need to supervise workers to ensure that
adequate amounts of work are done in excess of what they pay in wages.
This means the idea (so beloved by pro-capitalist economics) that a
worker's wage **is** the equivalent of what she produces is one violated
everyday within reality:

> *"Managers of a capitalist enterprise are not content simply to
> respond to the dictates of the market by equating the wage to the
> value of the marginal product of labour. Once the worker has entered
> the production process, the forces of the market have, for a time at
> least, been superseded. The effort-pay relation will depend not only
> on market relations of exchange but also. . . on the hierarchical
> relations of production -- on the relative power of managers and
> workers within the enterprise."* [William Lazonick, **Business
> Organisation and the Myth of the Market Economy**, pp. 184-5]

But, then again, capitalist economics is more concerned with justifying
the status quo than being in touch with the real world. To claim that a
workers wage represents her contribution and profit capital's is simply
false. Capital cannot produce anything (never mind a surplus) unless
used by labour and so profits do not represent the productivity of
capital. In and of themselves, fixed costs do not create value. Whether
value is created depends on how investments are developed and used once
in place. Which brings us back to labour (and the social relationships
which exist within an economy) as the fundamental source of surplus
value.

Then there is the concept of profit sharing, whereby workers are get a
share of the profits made by the company. Yet profits are the return to
capital. This shatters the notion that profits represent the
contribution of capital. **If** profits were the contribution of the
productivity of equipment, then sharing profits would mean that capital
was not receiving its full *"contribution"* to production (and so was
being exploited by labour!). It is unlikely that bosses would implement
such a scheme unless they knew they would get more profits out of it. As
such, profit sharing is usually used as a technique to **increase**
productivity and profits. Yet in neo-classical economics, it seems
strange that such a technique would be required if profits, in fact,
**did** represent capital's "contribution." After all, the machinery
which the workers are using is the same as before profit sharing was
introduced -- how could this unchanged capital stock produce an
increased "contribution"? It could only do so if, in fact, capital was
unproductive and it was the unpaid efforts, skills and energy of
workers' that actually was the source of profits. Thus the claim that
profit equals capital's "contribution" has little basis in fact.

As capital is not autonomously productive and goods are the product of
human (mental and physical) labour, Proudhon was right to argue that
*"Capital, tools, and machinery are likewise unproductive . . . The
proprietor who asks to be rewarded for the use of a tool or for the
productive power of his land, takes for granted, then, that which is
radically false; namely, that capital produces by its own effort - and,
in taking pay for this imaginary product, he literally receives
something for nothing."* [**What is Property?**, p. 169]

It will be objected that while capital is not productive in itself, its
use does make labour more productive. As such, surely its owner is
entitled to some share of the larger output produced by its aid. Surely
this means that the owners of capital deserve a reward? Is this
difference not the "contribution" of capital? Anarchists are not
convinced. Ultimately, this argument boils down to the notion that
giving permission to use something is a productive act, a perspective we
rejected in the [last section](secC2.html#secc23). In addition,
providing capital is unlike normal commodity production. This is because
capitalists, unlike workers, get paid multiple times for one piece of
work (which, in all likelihood, they paid others to do) and **keep** the
result of that labour. As Proudhon argued:

> "He [the worker] who manufactures or repairs the farmer's tools
> receives the price **once**, either at the time of delivery, or in
> several payments; and when this price is once paid to the
> manufacturer, the tools which he has delivered belong to him no more.
> Never can he claim double payment for the same tool, or the same job
> of repairs. If he annually shares in the products of the farmer, it is
> owing to the fact that he annually does something for the farmer.
> "The proprietor, on the contrary, does not yield his implement;
> eternally he is paid for it, eternally he keeps it." [**Op. Cit.**,
> pp. 169-170]

While the capitalist, in general, gets their investment back plus
something extra, the workers can never get their time back. That time
has gone, forever, in return for a wage which allows them to survive in
order to sell their time and labour (i.e. liberty) again. Meanwhile, the
masters have accumulated more capital and their the social and economic
power and, consequently, their ability to extract surplus value goes up
at a higher rate than the wages they have to pay (as we discuss in
[section C.7](secC7.html), this process is not without problems and
regularly causes economic crisis to break out).

Without labour nothing would have been produced and so, in terms of
justice, **at best** it could be claimed that the owners of capital
deserve to be paid only for what has been used of their capital (i.e.
wear and tear and damages). While it is true that the value invested in
fixed capital is in the course of time transferred to the commodities
produced by it and through their sale transformed into money, this does
not represent any actual labour by the owners of capital. Anarchists
reject the ideological sleight-of-hand that suggests otherwise and
recognise that (mental and physical) labour is the **only** form of
contribution that can be made by humans to a productive process. Without
labour, nothing can be produced nor the value contained in fixed capital
transferred to goods. As Charles A. Dana pointed out in his popular
introduction to Proudhon's ideas, *"[t]he labourer without capital would
soon supply his wants by its production . . . but capital with no
labourers to consume it can only lie useless and rot."* [**Proudhon and
his "Bank of the People"**, p. 31] If workers do not control the full
value of their contributions to the output they produce then they are
exploited and so, as indicated, capitalism is based upon exploitation.

Of course, as long as "capital" **is** owned by a different class than
as those who use it, this is extremely unlikely that the owners of
capital will simply accept a "reward" of damages. This is due to the
hierarchical organisation of production of capitalism. In the words of
the early English socialist Thomas Hodgskin *"capital does not derive
its utility from previous, but present labour; and does not bring its
owner a profit because it has been stored up, but because it is a means
of obtaining a command over labour."* [**Labour Defended against the
Claims of Capital**] It is more than a strange coincidence that the
people with power in a company, when working out who contributes most to
a product, decide it is themselves!

This means that the notion that labour gets its "share" of the products
created is radically false for, as *"a description of **property
rights**, the distributive shares picture is quite misleading and false.
The simple fact is that one legal party owns all the product. For
example, General Motors doesn't just own 'Capital's share' of the GM
cars produced; it owns all of them."* [Ellerman, **Op. Cit.**, p. 27] Or
as Proudhon put it, *"Property is the right to enjoy and dispose of
another's goods, -- the fruit of another's industry and labour."* The
only way to finally abolish exploitation is for workers to manage their
own work and the machinery and tools they use. This is implied, of
course, in the argument that labour is the source of property for *"if
labour is the sole basis of property, I cease to be a proprietor of my
field as soon as I receive rent for it from another . . . It is the same
with all capital."* Thus, *"all production being necessarily
collective"* and *"all accumulated capital being social property, no one
can be its exclusive proprietor."* [**What is Property?**, p. 171, p.
133 and p. 130]

The reason why capital gets a "reward" is simply due to the current
system which gives capitalist class an advantage which allows them to
refuse access to their property except under the condition that they
command the workers to make more than they have to pay in wages and keep
their capital at the end of the production process to be used afresh the
next. So while capital is not productive and owning capital is not a
productive act, under capitalism it is an enriching one and will
continue to be so until such time as that system is abolished. In other
words, profits, interest and rent are not founded upon any permanent
principle of economic or social life but arise from a specific social
system which produce specific social relationships. Abolish wage labour
by co-operatives, for example, and the issue of the "productivity" of
"capital" disappears as "capital" no longer exists (a machine is a
machine, it only becomes capital when it is used by wage labour).

So rather that the demand for labour being determined by the technical
considerations of production, it is determined by the need of the
capitalist to make a profit. This is something the neo-classical theory
implicitly admits, as the marginal productivity of labour is just a
roundabout way of saying that labour-power will be bought as long as the
wage is not higher than the profits that the workers produce. In other
words, wages do not rise above the level at which the capitalist will be
able to produce and realise surplus-value. To state that workers will be
hired as long as the marginal productivity of their labour exceeds the
wage is another way of saying that workers are exploited by their boss.
So even if we do ignore reality for the moment, this defence of profits
does **not** prove what it seeks to -- it shows that labour **is**
exploited under capitalism.

However, as we discuss in the [next section](secC5.html), this whole
discussion is somewhat beside the point. This is because marginal
productivity theory has been conclusively proven to be flawed by
dissident economics and has been acknowledged as such by leading
neo-classical economists.

C.2.5 Do profits represent the contribution of capital to production?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

In a word, no. While we have assumed the validity of "marginal
productivity" theory in relation to capital in the previous two
sections, the fact is that the theory is deeply flawed. This is on two
levels. Firstly, it does not reflect reality in any way. Secondly, it is
logically flawed and, even worse, this has been known to economists for
decades. While the first objection will hardly bother most neo-classical
economists (what part of that dogma **does** reflect reality?), the
second should as intellectual coherence is what replaces reality in
economics. However, in spite of "marginal productivity" theory being
proven to be nonsense and admitted as such by leading neo-classical
economists, it is still taught in economic classes and discussed in text
books as if it were valid.

We will discuss each issue in turn.

The theory is based on a high level of abstraction and the assumptions
used to allow the mathematics to work are so extreme that no real world
example could possibly meet them. The first problem is determining the
level at which the theory should be applied. Does it apply to
individuals, groups, industries or the whole economy? For depending on
the level at which it is applied, there are different problems
associated with it and different conclusions to be drawn from it.
Similarly, the time period over which it is to be applied has an impact.
As such, the theory is so vague that it would be impossible to test as
its supporters would simply deny the results as being inapplicable to
**their** particular version of the model.

Then there are problems with the model itself. While it has to assume
that factors are identical in order to invoke the necessary mathematical
theory, none of the factors used are homogenous in the real world.
Similarly, for Euler's theory to be applied, there must be constant
returns to scale and this does not apply either (it would be fair to say
that the assumption of constant returns to scale was postulated to allow
the theorem to be invoked in the first place rather than as a result of
a scientific analysis of real industrial conditions). Also, the model
assumes an ideal market which cannot be realised and any real world
imperfections make it redundant. In the model, such features of the real
world as oligopolistic markets (i.e. markets dominated by a few firms),
disequilibrium states, market power, informational imperfections of
markets, and so forth do not exist. Including any of these real features
invalidates the model and no "factor" gets its just rewards.

Moreover, like neo-classical economics in general, this theory just
assumes the original distribution of ownership. As such, it is a boon
for those who have benefited from previous acts of coercion -- their
ill-gotten gains can now be used to generate income for them!

Finally, "marginal productivity" theory ignores the fact that most
production is collective in nature and, as a consequence, the idea of
subtracting a single worker makes little or no sense. As soon as there
is *"a division of labour and an interdependence of different jobs, as
is the case generally in modern industry,"* its *"absurdity can
immediately be shown."* For example, *"[i]f, in a coal-fired locomotive,
the train's engineer is eliminated, one does not 'reduce a little' of
the product (transportation), one eliminates it completely; and the same
is true if one eliminates the fireman. The 'product' of this indivisible
team of engineer and fireman obeys a law of all or nothing, and there is
no 'marginal product' of the one that can be separated from the other.
The same thing goes on the shop floor, and ultimately for the modern
factory as a whole, where jobs are closely interdependent."* [Cornelius
Castoriadis, **Political and Social Writings**, vol. 3, p. 213]
Kropotkin made the same point, arguing it *"is utterly impossible to
draw a distinction between the work"* of the individuals collectively
producing a product as all *"contribute . . . in proportion to their
strength, their energy, their knowledge, their intelligence, and their
skill."* [**The Conquest of Bread**, p. 170 and p. 169]

This suggests another explanation for the existence of profits than the
"marginal productivity" of capital. Let us assume, as argued in marginal
productivity theory, that a worker receives exactly what she has
produced because if she ceases to work, the total product will decline
by precisely the value of her wage. However, this argument has a flaw in
it. This is because the total product will decline by more than that
value if two or more workers leave. This is because the wage each worker
receives under conditions of perfect competition is assumed to be the
product of the **last** labourer in neo-classical theory. The
neo-classical argument presumes a "declining marginal productivity,"
i.e. the marginal product of the last worker is assumed to be less than
the second last and so on. In other words, in neo-classical economics,
all workers bar the mythical "last worker" do not receive the full
product of their labour. They only receive what the **last** worker is
claimed to produce and so everyone **bar** the last worker does not
receive exactly what he or she produces. In other words, all the workers
are exploited bar the last one.

However, this argument forgets that co-operation leads to increased
productivity which the capitalists appropriate for themselves. This is
because, as Proudhon argued, *"the capitalist has paid as many times one
day's wages"* rather than the workers collectively and, as such, *"he
has paid nothing for that immense power which results from the union and
harmony of labourers, and the convergence and simultaneousness of their
efforts. Two hundred grenadiers stood the obelisk of Luxor upon its base
in a few hours; do you suppose that one man could have accomplished the
same task in two hundred days? Nevertheless, on the books of the
capitalist, the amount of wages would have been the same."* Therefore,
the capitalist has *"paid all the individual forces"* but *"the
collective force still remains to be paid. Consequently, there remains a
right of collective property"* which the capitalist *"enjoy[s]
unjustly."* [**What is Property?**, p. 127 and p. 130]

As usual, therefore, we must distinguish between the ideology and
reality of capitalism. As we indicated in [section C.1](secC1.html), the
model of perfect competition has no relationship with the real world.
Unsurprisingly, marginal productivity theory is likewise unrelated to
reality. This means that the assumptions required to make "marginal
productivity" theory work are so unreal that these, in themselves,
should have made any genuine scientist reject the idea out of hand.
Note, we are **not** opposing abstract theory, **every** theory
abstracts from reality is some way. We are arguing that, to be valid, a
theory has to reflect the real situation it is seeking to explain in
some meaningful way. Any abstractions or assumptions used must be
relatively trivial and, when relaxed, not result in the theory
collapsing. This is not the case with marginal productivity theory. It
is important to recognise that there are degrees of abstraction. There
are *"negligibility assumptions"* which state that some aspect of
reality has little or no effect on what is being analysed. Sadly for
marginal productivity theory, its assumptions are not of this kind.
Rather, they are *"domain assumptions"* which specify *"the conditions
under which a particular theory will apply. If those conditions do not
apply, then neither does the theory."* [Steve Keen, **Debunking
Economics**, p. 151] This is the case here.

However, most economists will happily ignore this critique for, as noted
repeatedly, basing economic theory on reality or realistic models is not
considered a major concern by neoclassical economists. However,
"marginal productivity" theory applied to capital is riddled with
logical inconsistencies which show that it is simply wrong. In the words
of the noted left-wing economist Joan Robinson:

> *"The neo-classicals evidently had not been told that the
> neo-classical theory did not contain a solution of the problems of
> profits or of the value of capital. They have erected a towering
> structure of mathematical theorems on a foundation that does not
> exist. Recently [in the 1960s, leading neo-classical economist] Paul
> Samuelson was sufficiently candid to admit that the basis of his
> system does not hold, but the theorems go on pouring out just the
> same."* [**Contributions to Modern Economics**, p. 186]

If profits **are** the result of private property and the inequality it
produces, then it is unsurprising that neoclassical theory would be as
foundationless as Robinson argues. After all, this is a **political**
question and neo-classical economics was developed to ignore such
questions. Marginal productivity theory has been subject to intense
controversy, precisely because it claims to show that labour is not
exploited under capitalism (i.e. that each factor gets what it
contributes to production). We will now summarise this successful
criticism.

The first major theoretical problem is obvious: how do you measure
capital? In neoclassical economics, capital is referred to as machinery
of all sorts as well as the workplaces that house them. Each of these
items is, in turn, made up of a multitude of other commodities and many
of these are assemblies of other commodities. So what does it mean to
say, as in marginal productivity theory, that "capital" is varied by one
unit? The only thing these products have in common is a price and that
is precisely what economists **do** use to aggregate capital. Sadly,
though, shows *"that there is no meaning to be given to a 'quantity of
capital' apart from the rate of profit, so that the contention that the
'marginal product of capital' determines the rate of profit is
meaningless."* [Robinson, **Op. Cit.**, p. 103] This is because argument
is based on circular reasoning:

> "For long-period problems we have to consider the meaning of the rate
> of profit on capital . . . the value of capital equipment, reckoned as
> its future earnings discounted at a rate of interest equal to the rate
> of profit, is equal to its initial cost, which involves prices
> including profit at the same rate on the value of the capital involved
> in producing it, allowing for depreciation at the appropriate rate
> over its life up to date.
> "The value of a stock of capital equipment, therefore, involves the
> rate of profit. There is no meaning in a 'quantity of capital' apart
> from the rate of profit." [**Collected Economic Papers**, vol. 4, p.
> 125]

Looking at it another way, neo-classical economics seeks to
simultaneously solve the problems of production and income distribution.
It attempts to show how the level of employment of capital and labour is
determined as well as how national income is divided between the two.
The latter is done by multiplying the quantities of labour and capital
by the equilibrium wage and interest rate, respectively. In the long
term, equilibrium conditions are governed by the net marginal
productivity of each factor, with each supplied until its net marginal
revenue is zero. This is why the market rate of interest is used as
capital is assumed to have marginal productivity and the existing market
interest reflects that.

Yet in what sense can we say that capital has marginal productivity? How
is the stock of capital to be measured? One measure is to take the
present value of the income stream expected to accrue to capital owners.
However, where does this discount rate and net income stream come from?
To find a value for these, it is necessary to estimate a national income
and the division of income between labour and capital but that is what
the analysis was meant to produce. In other words, the neo-classical
theory requires assumptions which are, in fact, the solution. This means
that value of capital is dependent on the distribution of income. As
there is no rationale offered for choosing one income distribution over
another, the neo-classical theory does not solve the problem it set out
to investigate but rather simply assumes it away. It is a tautology. It
asks how the rate of profit is determined and answers by referencing the
quantity of capital and its marginal revenue product. When asked how
these are determined, the reply is based on assuming a division of
future income and the discounting of the returns of capital with the
market rate of interest. That is, it simply says that the market rate of
interest is a function of the market rate of interest (and an assumed
distribution of income).

In other words, according to neoclassical theory, the rate of profit and
interest depends on the amount of capital, and the amount of capital
depends on the rate of profit and interest. One has to assume a rate of
profit in order to demonstrate the equilibrium rate of return is
determined. This issue is avoided in neo-classical economics simply by
ignoring it (it must be noted that the same can be said of the
"Austrian" concept of *"roundaboutness"* as *"it is impossible to define
one way of producing a commodity as 'more roundabout' than another
independently of the rate of profit . . . Therefore the Austrian notion
of roundaboutness is as internally inconsistent as the neoclassical
concept of the marginal productivity of capital."* [Steve Keen,
**Debunking Economics**, p. 302]).

The next problem with the theory is that "capital" is treated as
something utterly unreal. Take, for example, leading neoclassical Dennis
Robertson's 1931 attempt to explain the marginal productivity of labour
when holding "capital" constant:

> *"If ten men are to be set out to dig a hole instead of nine, they
> will be furnished with ten cheaper spades instead of nine more
> expensive ones; or perhaps if there is no room for him to dig
> comfortably, the tenth man will be furnished with a bucket and sent to
> fetch beer for the other nine."* [*"Wage-grumbles"*, **Economic
> Fragments**, p. 226]

So to work out the marginal productivity of the factors involved, *"ten
cheaper spades"* somehow equals nine more expensive spades? How is this
keeping capital constant? And how does this reflect reality? Surely, any
real world example would involve sending the tenth digger to get another
spade? And how do nine expensive spades become nine cheaper ones? In the
real world, this is impossible but in neoclassical economics this is not
only possible but required for the theory to work. As Robinson argued,
in neo-classical theory the *"concept of capital all the man-made
factors are boiled into one, which we may call **leets** . . . [which],
though all made up of one physical substance, is endowed with the
capacity to embody various techniques of production . . . and a change
of technique can be made simply by squeezing up or spreading out leets,
instantaneously and without cost."* [**Contributions to Modern
Economics**, p. 106]

This allows economics to avoid the obvious aggregation problems with
"capital", make sense of the concept of adding an extra unit of capital
to discover its "marginal productivity" and allows capital to be held
"constant" so that the "marginal productivity" of labour can be found.
For when *"the stock of means of production in existence can be
represented as a quantity of ectoplasm, we can say, appealing to Euler's
theorem, that the rent per unit of ectoplasm is equal to the marginal
product of the given quantity of ectoplasm when it is fully utilised.
This does seem to add anything of interest to the argument."* [**Op.
Cit.**, p. 99] This ensures reality has to be ignored and so economic
theory need not discuss any practical questions:

> *"When equipment is made of leets, there is no distinction between
> long and short-period problems . . . Nine spades are lumps of leets;
> when the tenth man turns up it is squeezed out to provide him with a
> share of equipment nine-tenths of what each man had before . . . There
> is no room for imperfect competition. There is no possibility of
> disappointed expectations . . . There is no problem of unemployment .
> . . Unemployed workers would bid down wages and the pre-existing
> quantity of leets would be spread out to accommodate them."* [**Op.
> Cit.**, p. 107]

The concept that capital goods are made of ectoplasm and can be
remoulded into the profit maximising form from day to day was invented
in order to prove that labour and capital both receive their
contribution to society, to show that labour is not exploited. It is not
meant to be taken literally, it is only a parable, but without it the
whole argument (and defence of capitalism) collapses. Once capital
equipment is admitted to being actual, specific objects that cannot be
squeezed, without cost, into new objects to accommodate more or less
workers, such comforting notions that profits equal the (marginal)
contribution of "capital" or that unemployment is caused by wages being
too high have to be discarded for the wishful thinking they most surely
are.

The last problem arises when ignore these issues and assume that
marginal productivity theory is correct. Consider the notion of the
short run, where at least one factor of production cannot be varied. To
determine its marginal productivity then capital has to be the factor
which is varied. However, common sense suggests that capital is the
least flexible factor and if that can be varied then every other one can
be as well? As dissident economist Piero Sraffa argued, when a market is
defined broadly enough, then the key neoclassical assumption that the
demand and supply of a commodity are independent breaks down. This was
applied by another economist, Amit Bhaduri, to the "capital market"
(which is, by nature, a broadly defined industry). Steve Keen usually
summarises these arguments, noting that *"at the aggregate level [of the
economy as a whole], the desired relationship -- the rate of profit
equals the marginal productivity of capital -- will not hold true"* as
it only applies *"when the capital to labour ratio is the same in all
industries -- which is effectively the same as saying there is only one
industry."* This *"proves Sraffa's assertion that, when a broadly
defined industry is considered, changes in its conditions of supply and
demand will affect the distribution of income."* This means that a
*"change in the capital input will change output, but it also changes
the wage, and the rate of profit . . . As a result, the distribution of
income is neither meritocratic nor determined by the market. The
distribution of income is to some significant degree determined
independently of marginal productivity and the impartial blades of
supply and demand . . . To be able to work out prices, it is first
necessary to know the distribution of income . . . There is therefore
nothing sacrosanct about the prices that apply in the economy, and
equally nothing sacrosanct about the distribution of income. It reflects
the relative power of different groups in society."* [**Op. Cit.**, p.
135]

It should be noted that this critique bases itself on the neoclassical
assumption that it is possible to define a factor of production called
capital. In other words, even if we assume that neo-classical economics
theory of capital is not circular reasoning, it's theory of distribution
is still logically wrong.

So mainstream economics is based on a theory of distribution which is
utterly irrelevant to the real world and is incoherent when applied to
capital. This would not be important except that it is used to justify
the distribution of income in the real world. For example, the widening
gap between rich and poor (it is argued) simply reflects a market
efficiently rewarding more productive people. Thus the compensation for
corporate chief executives climbs so sharply because it reflects their
marginal productivity. Except, of course, the theory supports no such
thing -- except in a make believe world which cannot exist (lassiez
fairy land, anyone?).

It must be noted that this successful critique of neoclassical economics
by dissident economists was first raised by Joan Robinson in the 1950s
(it usually called the Cambridge Capital Controversy). It is rarely
mentioned these days. While most economic textbooks simply repeat the
standard theory, the fact is that this theory has been successfully
debunked by dissident economists over four decades go. As Steve Keen
notes, while leading neoclassical economists admitted that the critique
was correct in the 1960s, today *"economic theory continues to use
exactly the same concepts which Sraffa's critique showed to be
completely invalid"* in spite the *"definitive capitulation by as
significant an economist as Paul Samuelson."* As he concludes: *"There
is no better sign of the intellectual bankruptcy of economics than
this."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 146, p. 129 and p. 147]

Why? Simply because the Cambridge Capital Controversy would expose the
student of economics to some serious problems with neo-classical
economics and they may start questioning the internal consistency of its
claims. They would also be exposed to alternative economic theories and
start to question whether profits **are** the result of exploitation. As
this would put into jeopardy the role of economists as, to quote Marx,
the *"hired prize-fighters"* for capital who replace *"genuine
scientific research"* with *"the bad conscience and evil intent of
apologetics."* Unsurprisingly, he characterised this as *"vulgar
economics."* [**Capital**, vol. 1, p. 97]

C.2.6 Does interest represent the "time value" of money?
--------------------------------------------------------

One defence of interest is the notion of the "time value" of money, that
individuals have different "time preferences." Most individuals prefer,
it is claimed, to consume now rather than later while a few prefer to
save now on the condition that they can consume more later. Interest,
therefore, is the payment that encourages people to defer consumption
and so is dependent upon the subjective evaluations of individuals. It
is, in effect, an exchange over time and so surplus value is generated
by the exchange of present goods for future goods.

Based on this argument, many supporters of capitalism claim that it is
legitimate for the person who provided the capital to get back **more**
than they put in, because of the "time value of money." This is because
investment requires savings and the person who provides those had to
postpone a certain amount of current consumption and only agree to do
this only if they get an increased amount later (i.e. a portion, over
time, of the increased output that their saving makes possible). This
plays a key role in the economy as it provide the funds from which
investment can take place and the economy grow.

In this theory, interest rates are based upon this "time value" of money
and the argument is rooted in the idea that individuals have different
"time preferences." Some economic schools, like the Austrian school,
argue that the actions by banks and states to artificially lower
interest rates (by, for example, creating credit or printing money)
create the business cycle as this distorts the information about
people's willingness to consume now rather than later leading to over
investment and so to a slump.

That the idea of doing nothing (i.e. not consuming) can be considered as
productive says a lot about capitalist theory. However, this is beside
the point as the argument is riddled with assumptions and, moreover,
ignores key problems with the notion that savings always lead to
investment.

The fundamental weakness of the theory of time preference must be that
it is simply an unrealistic theory and does not reflect where the supply
of capital does come from. It **may** be appropriate to the decisions of
households between saving and consumption, but the main source of new
capital is previous profit under capitalism. The motivation of making
profits is not the provision of future means of consumption, it is
profits for their own sake. The nature of capitalism requires profits to
be accumulated into capital for if capitalists **did** only consume the
system would break down. While from the point of view of the mainstream
economics such profit-making for its own sake is irrational in reality
it is imposed on the capitalist by capitalist competition. It is only by
constantly investing, by introducing new technology, work practices and
products, can the capitalists keep their capital (and income) intact.
Thus the motivation of capitalists to invest is imposed on them by the
capitalist system, not by subjective evaluations between consuming more
later rather than now.

Ignoring this issue and looking at the household savings, the theory
still raises questions. The most obvious problem is that an individual's
psychology is conditioned by the social situation they find themselves
in. Ones "time preference" is determined by ones social position. If one
has more than enough money for current needs, one can more easily
"discount" the future (for example, workers will value the future
product of their labour less than their current wages simply because
without those wages there will be no future). We will discuss this issue
in more detail later and will not do so here (see [section
C.2.7](secC2.html#secc27)).

The second thing to ask is why should the supply price of waiting be
assumed to be positive? If the interest rate simply reflects the
subjective evaluations of individuals then, surely, it could be negative
or zero. Deferred gratification is as plausible a psychological
phenomenon as the overvaluation of present satisfactions, while
uncertainty is as likely to produce immediate consumption as it is to
produce provision for the future (saving). Thus Joan Robinson:

> "The rate of interest (excess of repayment over original loan) would
> settle at the level which equated supply and demand for loans. Whether
> it was positive or negative would depend upon whether spendthrifts or
> prudent family men happened to predominate in the community. There is
> no **a priori** presumption in favour of a positive rate. Thus, the
> rate of interest cannot be account for as the 'cost of waiting.'
> "The reason why there is always a demand for loans at a positive rate
> of interest, in an economy where there is property in the means of
> production and means of production are scarce, is that finance
> expended now can be used to employ labour in productive processes
> which will yield a surplus in the future over costs of production.
> Interest is positive because profits are positive (though at the same
> time the cost and difficulty of obtaining finance play a part in
> keeping productive equipment scarce, and so contribute to maintaining
> the level of profits)." [**Contributions to Modern Economics**, p. 83]

It is only because money provides the authority to allocate resources
and exploit wage labour that money now is more valuable (*"we know that
mere saving itself brings in nothing, so long as the pence saved are not
used to exploit."* [Kropotkin, **The Conquest of Bread**, p. 59]). The
capitalist does not supply "time" (as the "time value" theory argues),
the loan provides authority/power and so the interest rate does not
reflect "time preference" but rather the utility of the loan to
capitalists, i.e. whether it can be used to successfully exploit labour.
If the expectations of profits by capitalists are low (as in, say,
during a depression), loans would not be desired no matter how low the
interest rate became. As such, the interest rate is shaped by the
general profit level and so be independent of the "time preference" of
individuals.

Then there is the problem of circularity. In any real economy, interest
rates obviously shape people's saving decisions. This means that an
individual's "time preference" is shaped by the thing it is meant to
explain:

> *"But there may be some savers who have the psychology required by the
> text books and weigh a preference for present spending against an
> increment of income (interest, dividends and capital gains) to be had
> from an increment of wealth. But what then? Each individual goes on
> saving or dis-saving till the point where his individual subjective
> rate of discount is equal to the market rate of interest. There has to
> be a market rate of interest for him to compare his rate of discount
> to."* [Joan Robinson, **Op. Cit.**, pp. 11-12]

Looking at the individuals whose subjective evaluations allegedly
determine the interest rate, there is the critical question of
motivation. Looking at lenders, do they **really** charge interest
because they would rather spend more money later than now? Hardly, their
motivation is far more complicated than that. It is doubtful that many
people actually sit down and work out how much their money is going to
be "worth" to them a year or more from now. Even if they did, the fact
is that they really have no idea how much it will be worth. The future
is unknown and uncertain and, consequently, it is implausible that "time
preference" plays the determining role in the decision making process.

In most economies, particularly capitalism, the saver and lender are
rarely the same person. People save and the banks use it to loan it to
others. The banks do not do this because they have a low "time
preference" but because they want to make profits. They are a business
and make their money by charging more interest on loans than they give
on savings. Time preference does not enter into it, particularly as, to
maximise profits, banks loan out more (on credit) than they have in
savings and, consequently, make the actual interest rate totally
independent of the rate "time preference" would (in theory) produce.

Given that it would be extremely difficult, indeed impossible, to stop
banks acting in this way, we can conclude that even if "time preference"
were true, it would be of little use in the real world. This,
ironically, is recognised by the same free market capitalist economists
who advocate a "time preference" perspective on interest. Usually
associated with the "Austrian" school, they argue that banks should have
100% reserves (i.e. they loan out only what they have in savings, backed
by gold). This implicitly admits that the interest rate does not reflect
"time preference" but rather the activities (such as credit creation) of
banks (not to mention other companies who extend business credit to
consumers). As we discuss in [section C.8](secC8.html), this is not due
to state meddling with the money supply or the rate of interest but
rather the way capitalism works.

Moreover, as the banking industry is marked, like any industry, by
oligopolistic competition, the big banks will be able to add a mark up
on services, so distorting any interest rates set even further from any
abstract "time preference" that exists. Therefore, the structure of that
market will have a significant effect on the interest rate. Someone in
the same circumstances with the same "time preference" will get
radically different interest rates depending on the "degree of monopoly"
of the banking sector (see [section C.5](secC5.html) for "degree of
monopoly"). An economy with a multitude of small banks, implying low
barriers of entry, will have different interest rates than one with a
few big firms implying high barriers (if banks are forced to have 100%
gold reserves, as desired by many "free market" capitalists, then these
barriers may be even higher). As such, it is highly unlikely that "time
preference" rather than market power is a more significant factor in
determining interest rates in any **real** economy. Unless, of course,
the rather implausible claim is made that the interest rate would be the
same no matter how competitive the banking market was -- which, of
course, is what the "time preference" argument does imply.

Nor is "time preference" that useful when we look at the saver. People
save money for a variety of motives, few (if any) of which have anything
to do with "time preference." A common motive is, unsurprisingly,
uncertainty about the future. Thus people put money into savings
accounts to cover possible mishaps and unexpected developments (as in
*"saving for a rainy day"*). Indeed, in an uncertain world future money
may be its own reward for immediate consumption is often a risky thing
to do as it reduces the ability to consumer in the future (for example,
workers facing unemployment in the future could value the same amount of
money more then than now). Given that the future is uncertain, many save
precisely for precautionary reasons and increasing current consumption
is viewed as a disutility as it is risky behaviour. Another common
reason would be to save because they do not have enough money to buy
what they want now. This is particularly the case with working class
families who face stagnating or falling income or face financial
difficulties.[Henwood, **Wall Street**, p. 65] Again, "time preference"
does not come into it as economic necessity forces the borrowers to
consume more now in order to be around in the future.

Therefore, money lending is, for the poor person, not a choice between
more consumption now/less later and less consumption now/more later. If
there is no consumption now, there will not be any later. So not
everybody saves money because they want to be able to spend more at a
future date. As for borrowing, the real reason for it is necessity
produced by the circumstances people find themselves in. As for the
lender, their role is based on generating a current and future income
stream, like any business. So if "time preference" seems unlikely for
the lender, it seems even more unlikely for the borrower or saver. Thus,
while there is an element of time involved in decisions to save, lend
and borrow, it would be wrong to see interest as the consequence of
"time preference." Most people do not think in terms of it and,
therefore, predicting their behaviour using it would be silly.

At the root of the matter is that for the vast majority of cases in a
capitalist economy, an individual's "time preference" is determined by
their social circumstances, the institutions which exist, uncertainty
and a host of other factors. As inequality drives "time preference,"
there is no reason to explain interest rates by the latter rather than
the former. Unless, of course, you are seeking to rationalise and
justify the rich getting richer. Ultimately, interest is an expression
of inequality, **not** exchange:

> *"If there is chicanery afoot in calling 'money now' a different good
> than 'money later,' it is by no means harmless, for the intended
> effect is to subsume money lending under the normative rubric of
> exchange . . . [but] there are obvious differences . . . [for in

> loaning] he has something you don't . . . [so] inequality dominates
> the relationship. He has more than you have now, and he will get back
> more than he gives."* [Schweickart, **Against Capitalism**, p. 23]

While the theory is less than ideal, the practice is little better.
Interest rates have numerous perverse influences in any real economy. In
neo-classical and related economics, saving does not have a negative
impact on the economy as it is argued that non-consumed income must be
invested. While this could be the case when capitalism was young, when
the owners of firms ploughed their profits back into them, as financial
institutions grew this became less so. Saving and investment became
different activities, governed by the rate of interest. If the supply of
savings increased, the interest rate would drop and capitalists would
invest more. If the demand for loans increased, then the interest rate
would rise, causing more savings to occur.

While the model is simple and elegant, it does have its flaws. These are
first analysed by Keynes during the Great Depression of the 1930s, a
depression which the neo-classical model said was impossible.

For example, rather than bring investment into line with savings, a
higher interest can cause savings to fall as *"[h]ousehold saving, of
course, is mainly saving up to spend later, and . . . it is likely to
respond the wrong way. A higher rate of return means that 'less' saving
is necessary to get a given pension or whatever."* [Robinson, **Op.
Cit.**, p. 11] Similarly, higher interest rates need not lead to higher
investment as higher interest payments can dampen profits as both
consumers and industrial capitalists have to divert more of their
finances away from real spending and towards debt services. The former
causes a drop in demand for products while the latter leaves less for
investing.

As argued by Keynes, the impact of saving is not as positive as some
like to claim. Any economy is a network, where decisions affect
everyone. In a nutshell, the standard model fails to take into account
changes of income that result from decisions to invest and save (see
Michael Stewart's **Keynes and After** for a good, if basic,
introduction). This meant that if some people do not consume now, demand
falls for certain goods, production is turned away from consumption
goods, and this has an effect on all. Some firms will find their sales
failing and may go under, causing rising unemployment. Or, to put it
slightly differently, aggregate demand -- and so aggregate supply -- is
changed when some people postpone consumption, and this affects others.
The decrease in the demand for consumer goods affects the producers of
these goods. With less income, the producers would reduce their
expenditure and this would have repercussions on other people's incomes.
In such circumstances, it is unlikely that capitalists would be seeking
to invest and so rising savings would result in falling investment in
spite of falling interest rates. In an uncertain world, investment will
only be done if capitalists think that they will end up with more money
than they started with and this is unlikely to happen when faced with
falling demand.

Whether rising interest rates do cause a crisis is dependent on the
strength of the economy. During a strong expansion, a modest rise in
interest rates may be outweighed by rising wages and profits. During a
crisis, falling rates will not counteract the general economic despair.
Keynes aimed to save capitalism from itself and urged state intervention
to counteract the problems associated with free market capitalism. As we
discuss in [section C.8.1](secC8.html#secc81), this ultimately failed
partly due to the mainstream economics gutting Keynes' work of key
concepts which were incompatible with it, partly due to Keynes' own
incomplete escape from neoclassical economics, partly due the
unwillingness of rentiers to agree to their own euthanasia but mostly
because capitalism is inherently unstable due to the hierarchical (and
so oppressive and exploitative) organisation of production.

Which raises the question of whether someone who saves deserve a reward
for so doing? Simply put, no. Why? Because the act of saving is no more
an act of production than is purchasing a commodity (most investment
comes from retained profits and so the analogy is valid). Clearly the
reward for purchasing a commodity is that commodity. By analogy, the
reward for saving should be not interest but one's savings -- the
ability to consume at a later stage. Particularly as the effects of
interest rates and savings can have such negative impacts on the rest of
the economy. It seems strange, to say the least, to reward people for
helping do so. Why should someone be rewarded for a decision which may
cause companies to go bust, so **reducing** the available means of
production as reduced demand results in job loses and idle factories?
Moreover, this problem *"becomes ever more acute the richer or more
inegalitarian the society becomes, since wealthy people tend to save
more than poor people."* [Schweickart, **After Capitalism**, p. 43]

Supporters of capitalists assume that people will not save unless
promised the ability to consume **more** at a later stage, yet close
examination of this argument reveals its absurdity. People in many
different economic systems save in order to consume later, but only in
capitalism is it assumed that they need a reward for it beyond the
reward of having those savings available for consumption later. The
peasant farmer "defers consumption" in order to have grain to plant next
year, even the squirrel "defers consumption" of nuts in order to have a
stock through winter. Neither expects to see their stores increase in
size over time. Therefore, saving is rewarded by saving, as consuming is
rewarded by consuming. In fact, the capitalist "explanation" for
interest has all the hallmarks of apologetics. It is merely an attempt
to justify an activity without careful analysing it.

To be sure, there is an economic truth underlying this argument for
justifying interest, but the formulation by supporters of capitalism is
inaccurate and unfortunate. There is a sense in which 'waiting' is a
condition for capital **increase**, though not for capital per se. Any
society which wishes to increase its stock of capital goods may have to
postpone some gratification. Workplaces and resources turned over to
producing capital goods cannot be used to produce consumer items, after
all. How that is organised differs from society to society. So, like
most capitalist economics there is a grain of truth in it but this grain
of truth is used to grow a forest of half-truths and confusion.

As such, this notion of "waiting" only makes sense in a 'Robinson
Crusoe" style situation, **not** in any form of real economy. In a real
economy, we do not need to "wait" for our consumption goods until
investment is complete since the division of labour/work has replaced
the succession in time by a succession in place. We are dealing with an
already well developed system of **social** production and an economy
based on a social distribution of labour in which there are available
all the various stages of the production process. As such, the notion
that "waiting" is required makes little sense. This can be seen from the
fact that it is not the capitalist who grants an advance to the worker.
In almost all cases the worker is paid by their boss **after** they have
completed their work. That is, it is the worker who makes an advance of
their labour power to the capitalist. This waiting is only possible
because *"no species of labourer depends on any previously prepared
stock, for in fact no such stock exists; but every species of labourer
does constantly, and at all times, depend for his supplies on the
co-existing labour of some other labourers."* [Thomas Hodgskin, **Labour
Defended Against the Claims of Capital**] This means that the workers,
as a class, creates the fund of goods out of which the capitalists pay
them.

Ultimately, selling the use of money (paid for by interest) is not the
same as selling a commodity. The seller of the commodity does not
receive the commodity back as well as its price, unlike the typical
lender of money. In effect, as with rent and profits, interest is
payment for permission to use something and, therefore, not a productive
act which should be rewarded. It is **not** the same as other forms of
exchange. Proudhon pointed out the difference:

> "Comparing a loan to a **sale**, you say: Your argument is as valid
> against the latter as against the former, for the hatter who sells
> hats does not **deprive** himself.
> "No, for he receives for his hats -- at least he is reputed to receive

> **less**. But the capitalist lender not only is not deprived, since he

> part. Now, a service which costs no labour to him who renders it is a
> service which may become gratuitous." [**Interest and Principal: The
> Circulation of Capital, Not Capital Itself, Gives Birth to Progress**]

The reason why interest rates do not fall to zero is due to the class
nature of capitalism, **not** "time preference." That it is ultimately
rooted in social institutions can be seen from Böhm-Bawerk's
acknowledgement that monopoly can result in exploitation by increasing
the rate of interest above the rate specified by "time preference" (i.e.
the market):

> "Now, of course, the circumstances unfavourable to buyers may be
> corrected by active competition among sellers . . . But, every now and
> then, something will suspend the capitalists' competition, and then

> p. 361]

Little wonder, then, that Proudhon continually stressed the need for
working people to organise themselves and credit (which, of course, they
would have done naturally, if it were not for the state intervening to
protect the interests, income and power of the ruling class, i.e. of
itself and the economically dominant class). If, as Böhm-Bawerk
admitted, interest rates could be high due to institutional factors
then, surely, they do not reflect the "time preferences" of individuals.
This means that they could be lower (effectively zero) if society
organised itself in the appropriate manner. The need for savings could
be replaced by, for example, co-operation and credit (as already exists,
in part, in any developed economy). Organising these could ensure a
positive cycle of investment, growth and savings (Keynes, it should be
noted, praised Proudhon's follower Silvio Gesell in **The General
Theory**. For a useful discussion see Dudley Dillard's essay *"Keynes
and Proudhon"* [**The Journal of Economic History**, vol. 2, No. 1, pp.
63-76]).

Thus the key flaw in the theory is that of capitalist economics in
general. By concentrating on the decisions of individuals, it ignores
the social conditions in which these decisions are made. By taking the
social inequalities and insecurities of capitalism as a given, the
theory ignores the obvious fact that an individual's "time preference"
will be highly shaped by their circumstances. Change those circumstances
and their "time preference" will also change. In other words, working
people have a different "time preference" to the rich because they are
poorer. Similarly, by focusing on individuals, the "time preference"
theory fails to take into account the institutions of a given society.
If working class people have access to credit in other forms than those
supplied by capitalists then their "time preference" will differ
radically. As an example, we need only look at credit unions. In
communities with credit unions the poor are less likely to agree to get
into an agreement from a loan shark. It seems unlikely, to say the
least, that the "time preference" of those involved have changed. They
are subject to the same income inequalities and pressures as before, but
by uniting with their fellows they give themselves better alternatives.

As such, "time preference" is clearly not an independent factor. This
means that it cannot be used to justify capitalism or the charging of
interest. It simply says, in effect, that in a society marked by
inequality the rich will charge the poor as much interest as they can
get away with. This is hardly a sound basis to argue that charging
interest is a just or a universal fact. It reflects social inequality,
the way a given society is organised and the institutions it creates.
Put another way, there is no "natural" rate of interest which reflects
the subjective "time preferences" of abstract individuals whose
decisions are made without any social influence. Rather, the interest
rate depends on the conditions and institutions within the economy as a
whole. The rate of interest is positive under capitalism because it is a
class society, marked by inequality and power, **not** because of the
"time preference" of abstract individuals.

In summary, providing capital and charging interest are not productive
acts. As Proudhon argued, *"all rent received (nominally as damages, but
really as payment for a loan) is an act of property -- of robbery."*
[**What is Property**, p. 171]

C.2.7 Are interest and profit not the reward for waiting?
---------------------------------------------------------

Another defence of surplus value by capitalist economics is also based
on time. This argument is related to the "time preference" one we have
discussed in the [last section](secC6.html) and is, likewise, rooted in
the idea that money now is different than money later and, as a
consequence, surplus value represents (in effect) an exchange of present
goods for future ones. This argument has two main forms, depending on
whether it is interest or profits which are being defended, but both are
based on this perspective. We will discuss each in turn.

One of the oldest defences of interest is the "abstinence" theory first
postulated by Nassau Senior in 1836. For Senior, abstinence is a
sacrifice of present enjoyment for the purpose achieving some distant
result. This demands the same heavy sacrifice as does labour, for to
*"abstain from the enjoyment which is in our power, or to seek distant
rather than immediate results, are among the most painful exertions of
the human will."* Thus wages and interest/profit *"are to be considered
as the rewards of peculiar sacrifices, the former the remuneration for
labour, and the latter for abstinence from immediate enjoyment."* [**An
Outline of the Science of Political Economy**, p. 60 and p. 91]

Today, the idea that interest is the reward for "abstinence" on the part
of savers is still a common one in capitalist economics. However, by the
end of the nineteenth century, Senior's argument had become known as the
"waiting" theory while still playing the same role in justifying
non-labour income. One of the leading neo-classical economists of his
day, Alfred Marshall, argued that *"[i]f we admit [a commodity] is the
product of labour alone, and not of labour and waiting, we can no doubt
be compelled by an inexorable logic to admit that there is no
justification of interest, the reward for waiting."* [**Principles of
Economics**, p. 587] While implicitly recognising that labour is the
source of all value in capitalism (and that abstinence is not the
**source** of profits), it is claimed that interest is a justifiable
claim on the surplus value produced by a worker.

Why is this the case? Capitalist economics claims that by "deferring
consumption," the capitalist allows new means of production to be
developed and so should be rewarded for this sacrifice. In other words,
in order to have capital available as an input -- i.e. to bear costs now
for returns in the future -- someone has to be willing to postpone his
or her consumption. That is a real cost, and one that people will pay
only if rewarded for it:

> *"human nature being what it is, we are justified in speaking of the
> interest on capital as the reward of the sacrifice involved in waiting

The interest rate is, in neo-classical economic theory, set when the
demand for loans meets the supply of savings. The interest rate stems
from the fact that people prefer present spending over future spending.
If someone borrows £200 for one year at 5%, this is basically the same
as saying that there would rather have £200 now than £210 a year from
now. Thus interest is the cost of providing a service, namely time.
People are able to acquire today what they would otherwise not have
until sometime in the future. With a loan, interest is the price of the
advantage obtained from having money immediately rather than having to
wait for.

This, on first appears, seems plausible. If you accept the logic of
capitalist economics and look purely at individuals and their
preferences independently of their social circumstances then it can make
sense. However, once you look wider you start to see this argument start
to fall apart. Why is it that the wealthy are willing to save and
provide funds while it is the working class who do not save and get into
debt? Surely a person's "time preference" is dependent on their
socio-economic position? As we argued in the [last
section](secC2.html#secc26), this means that any subjective evaluation
of the present and future is dependent on, not independent of, the
structure of market prices and income distribution. It varies with the
income of individual and their class position, since the latter will
condition the degree or urgency of present wants and needs.

So this theory appears ludicrous to a critic of capitalism -- simply
put, does the mine owner really sacrifice more than a miner, a rich
stockholder more than an autoworker working in their car plant, a
millionaire investor more than a call centre worker? As such, the notion
that "waiting" explains interest is question begging in the extreme as
it utterly ignores inequality within a society. After all, it is far
easier for a rich person to "defer consumption" than for someone on an
average income. This is borne out by statistics, for as Simon Kuznets
has noted, *"only the upper income groups save; the total savings of
groups below the top decile are fairly close to zero."* [**Economic
Growth and Structure**, p. 263] Obviously, therefore, in modern society
it is the capitalist class, the rich, who refrain from expending their
income on immediate consumption and *"abstain."* Astonishingly, working
class people show no such desire to abstain from spending their wages on
immediate consumption. It does not take a genius to work out why,
although many economists have followed Senior in placing the blame on
working class lack of abstinence on poor education rather than, say, the
class system they live in (for Senior, *"the worse educated"* classes
*"are always the most improvident, and consequently the least
abstinent."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 60]).

Therefore, the plausibility of interest as payment for the pain of
deferring consumption rests on the premise that the typical saving unit
is a small or medium-income household. But in contemporary capitalist
societies, this is not the case. Such households are not the source of
most savings; the bulk of interest payments do not go to them. As such,
interest is the dependent factor and so "waiting" cannot explain
interest. Rather, interest is product of social inequality and the
social relationships produced by an economy. Lenders lend because they
have the funds to do so while borrowers borrow because without money now
they may not be around later. As those with funds are hardly going
without by lending, it does not make much sense to argue that they would
spend even more today without the temptation of more income later.

To put this point differently, the capitalist proponents of interest
only consider "postponing consumption" as an abstraction, without making
it concrete. For example, a capitalist may "postpone consumption" of his
10th Rolls Royce because he needs the money to upgrade some machinery in
his factory; whereas a single mother may have to "postpone consumption"
of food or adequate housing in order to attempt to better take care of
her children. The two situations are vastly different, yet the
capitalist equates them. This equation implies that "not being able to
buy anything you want" is the same as "not being able to buy things you
need", and is thus skewing the obvious difference in costs of such
postponement of consumption!

Thus Proudhon's comments that the loaning of capital *"does not involve
an actual sacrifice on the part of the capitalist"* and so *"does not
deprive himself. . . of the capital which be lends. He lends it, on the
contrary, precisely because the loan is not a deprivation to him; he
lends it because he has no use for it himself, being sufficiently
provided with capital without it; be lends it, finally, because he
neither intends nor is able to make it valuable to him personally, --
because, if he should keep it in his own hands, this capital, sterile by
nature, would remain sterile, whereas, by its loan and the resulting
interest, it yields a profit which enables the capitalist to live
without working. Now, to live without working is, in political as well
as moral economy, a contradictory proposition, an impossible thing."*
[**Interest and Principal: A Loan is a Service**]

In other words, contra Marshall, saving is **not** a sacrifice for the
wealthy and, as such, not deserving a reward. Proudhon goes on:

> *"The proprietor who possesses two estates, one at Tours, and the
> other at Orleans, and who is obliged to fix his residence on the one
> which he uses, and consequently to abandon his residence on the other,
> can this proprietor claim that he deprives himself of anything,
> because he is not, like God, ubiquitous in action and presence? As

> that of the master who has lost his slave, to that of the prince
> expelled by his subjects, to that of the robber who, wishing to break
> into a house, finds the dogs on the watch and the inmates at the
> windows."*

Given how much income this "abstinence" or "waiting" results in, we can
only conclude that it is the most painful of decisions possible for a
multi-millionaire to decide **not** to buy that fifth house and instead
save the money. The effort to restrain themselves from squandering their
entire fortunes all at once must be staggering. In the capitalist's
world, an industrialist who decides not to consume a part of their
riches "suffers" a cost equivalent to that of someone who postpones
consumption of their meagre income to save enough to get something they
need. Similarly, if the industrialist "earns" hundred times more in
interest than the wage of the worker who toils in their workplace, the
industrialist "suffers" hundred times more discomfort living in his
palace than, say, the coal miner does working at the coal face in
dangerous conditions or the worker stuck in a boring McJob they hate.
The "disutility" of postponing consumption while living in luxury is
obviously 100 times greater than the "disutility" of, say, working for a
living and so should be rewarded appropriately.

As there is no direct relationship between interest received and the
"sacrifice" involved (if anything, it is an **inverse** relationship),
the idea that interest is the reward for waiting is simply nonsense. You
need be no anarchist to come to this obvious conclusion. It was admitted
as much by a leading capitalist economist and his argument simply echoes
Proudhon's earlier critique:

> *"the existence and height of interest by no means invariably
> correspond with the existence and the height of a 'sacrifice of
> abstinence.' Interest, in exceptional cases, is received where there
> has been no individual sacrifice of abstinence. High interest is often

> and mortgage funds. These phenomena fit badly into a theory which
> explains interest quite universally as a 'wage of abstinence.'"*
> [Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk, **Capital and Interest**, p. 277]

All in all, as Joan Robinson pointed out, *"that the rate of interest is
the 'reward for waiting' but 'waiting' only means owning wealth . . . In
short, a man who refrains from blowing his capital in orgies and feasts
can continue to get interest on it. This seems perfectly correct, but as
a theory of distribution it is only a circular argument."*
[**Contributions to Modern Economics**, p. 11] Interest is not the
reward for "waiting," rather it is one of the (many) rewards for being
rich. This was admitted as much by Marshall himself, who noted that the
*"power to save depends on an excess of income over necessary
expenditure; and this is greatest among the wealthy."* [**Op. Cit.**, p.
229]

Little wonder, then, that neo-classical economists introduced the term
**waiting** as an "explanation" for returns to capital (such as
interest). Before this change in the jargon of economics, mainstream
economists used the notion of "abstinence" (the term used by Nassau
Senior) to account for (and so justify) interest. Just as Senior's
"theory" was seized upon to defend returns to capital, so was the term
"waiting" after it was introduced in the 1880s. Interestingly, while
describing **exactly** the same thing, "waiting" became the preferred
term simply because it had a less apologetic ring to it. Both describe
the *"sacrifice of present pleasure for the sake of future"* yet,
according to Marshall, the term *"abstinence"* was *"liable to be
misunderstood"* because there were just too many wealthy people around
who received interest and dividends without ever having abstained from
anything. As he admitted, the *"greatest accumulators of wealth are very
rich persons, some [!] of whom live in luxury, and certainly do not
practise abstinence in that sense of the term in which it is convertible
with abstemiousness."* So he opted for the term "waiting" because there
was *"advantage"* in its use to describe *"the accumulation of wealth"*
as the *"result of a postponement of enjoyment."* [**Op. Cit.**, pp.
232-3] This is particularly the case as socialists had long been
pointing out the obvious fact that capitalists do not *"abstain"* from
anything.

The lesson is obvious, in mainstream economics if reality conflicts with
your theory, do not reconsider the theory, change its name!

The problems of "waiting" and "abstinence" as the source of interest
becomes even clearer when we look at inherited wealth. Talking about
"abstinence" or "waiting" when discussing a capitalist inheriting a
company worth millions is silly. Senior recognised this, arguing that
income in this case is not profit, but rather *"has all the attributes
of rent."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 129] That such a huge portion of capitalist
revenue would not be considered profit shows the bankruptcy of any
theory which see profit as the reward for "waiting." However, Senior's
argument does show that interest payments need not reflect any positive
contribution to production by those who receive it. Like the landlord
receiving payment for owning a gift of nature, the capitalist receives
income for simply monopolising the work of previous generations and, as
Smith put it, the *"rent of land, considered as the price paid for the
use of land, is naturally a monopoly price."* [**The Wealth of
Nations**, p. 131]

Even capitalist economists, while seeking to justify interest, admit
that it *"arises independently of any personal act of the capitalist. It
accrues to him even though he has not moved any finger in creating it .
. . And it flows without ever exhausting that capital from which it
arises, and therefore without any necessary limit to its continuance. It
is, if one may use such an expression in mundane matters, capable of
everlasting life."* [Böhm-Bawerk, **Op. Cit.**, p. 1] Little wonder we
argued in [section C.2.3](secC2.html#secc23) that simply owning property
does not justify non-labour income.

In other words, due to **one** decision not to do anything (i.e. **not**
to consume), a person (and his or her heirs) may receive **forever** a
reward that is not tied to any productive activity. Unlike the people
actually doing the work (who only get a reward every time they
"contribute" to creating a commodity), the capitalist will get rewarded
for just **one** act of abstention. This is hardly a just arrangement.
As David Schweickart has pointed out, *"Capitalism does reward some
individuals perpetually. This, if it is to be justified by the canon of
contribution, one must defend the claim that some contributions are
indeed eternal."* [**Against Capitalism**, p. 17] As we noted in
[section C.1.1](secC1.html#secc11), current and future generations
should not be dominated by the actions of the long dead.

The "waiting" theory, of course, simply seeks to justify interest rather
than explain its origin. If the capitalist really **did** deserve an
income as a reward for their abstinence, where does it come from? It
cannot be created passively, merely by the decision to save, so interest
exists because the exploitation of labour exists. As Joan Robinson
summarised:

> "Obviously, the reward of saving is owning some more wealth. One of
> the advantages, though by no means the only one, of owning wealth is
> the possibility of getting interest on it.
> "But why is it possible to get interest? Because businesses make
> profits and are willing to borrow." [**Collected Economic Papers**,
> vol. 5, p. 36]

This is the key. If ones ability and willingness to "wait" is dependent
on social facts (such as available resources, ones class, etc.), then
interest cannot be based upon subjective evaluations, as these are not
the independent factor. In other words, saving does not express
"waiting", it simply expresses the extent of inequality and interest
expresses the fact that workers have to sell their labour to others in
order to survive:

So, interest has little to do with "waiting" and a lot more to do with
the inequalities associated with the capitalist system. In effect, the
"waiting" theory assumes what it is trying to prove. Interest is
positive simply because capitalists can appropriate surplus value from
workers and so current money is more valuable than future money because
of this fact. Ironically, therefore, the pro-capitalist theories of who
abstains are wrong, *"since saving is mainly out of profits, and real
wages tend to be lower the higher the rate of profit, the abstinence
associated with saving is mainly done by the workers, who do not receive
any share in the 'reward.'"* [Robinson, **Op. Cit.**, p. 393]

In other words, "waiting" does not produce a surplus, labour does. As
such, to *"say that those who hold financial instruments can lay claim
to a portion of the social product by abstaining or waiting provides no
explanation of what makes the production process profitable, and hence
to what extent interest claims or dividends can be paid. Reliance on a
waiting theory of the return to capital represented nothing less than a
reluctance of economists to confront the sources of value creation and
analyse the process of economic development."* [William Lazonick,
**Competitive Advantage on the Shop Floor**, p. 267] This would involve
having to analyse the social relations between workers and
managers/bosses on the shop floor, which would be to bring into question
the whole nature of capitalism and any claims it was based upon freedom.

To summarise, the idea that interest is the "reward" for waiting simply
ignores the reality of class society and, in effect, rewards the wealthy
for being wealthy. Neo-classical economics implies that being rich is
the ultimate disutility. The hardships ("sacrifices") of having to
decide to consume or invest their riches weighs as heavily on the elite
as they do on the scales of utility. Compared to, say, working in a
sweatshop, fearing unemployment (sorry, maximising "leisure") or not
having to worry about saving (as your income just covers your
out-goings) it is clear which are the greatest sacrifices and which are
rewarded accordingly under capitalism.

Much the same argument can be applied to "time-preference" theories of
profit. These argue that profits are the result of individuals
preferring present goods to future ones. Capitalists pay workers wages,
allowing them to consumer now rather than later. This is the providing
of time and this is rewarded by profits. This principle was first stated
clearly by Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk and has been taken as the basis of the
"Austrian" school of capitalist economics (see [section
C.1.6](secC1.html#secc16)). After rejecting past theories of interest
(including, as noted above, "abstinence" theories, which he concluded
the socialists were right to mock), Böhm-Bawerk argued that profits
could only by explained by means of time preference:

> *"**The loan is a real exchange of present goods against future
> goods** . . . present goods invariably possess a greater value than
> future goods of the same number and kind, and therefore a definite sum
> of present goods can, as a rule, only be purchased by a larger sum of
> future goods. Present goods possess an agio in future goods. **This
> agio is interest.** It is not a separate equivalent for a separate and
> durable use of the loaned goods, for that is inconceivable; it is a
> part equivalent of the loaned sum, kept separate for practical
> reasons. The replacement of the capital + the interest constitutes the
> full equivalent."* [**Capital and Interest**, p. 259]

For him, time preference alone is the reason for profit/interest due to
the relative low value of future goods, compared to present goods.
Capital goods, although already present in their physical state, are
really **future** goods in their *"economic nature"* as is labour. This
means that workers are paid the amount their labour creates in terms of
**future** goods, not **current** goods. This difference between the
high value of current goods and low value of future goods is the source
of surplus value:

> *"This, and nothing else, is the foundation of the so-called 'cheap'
> buying of production instruments, and especially of labour, which the
> Socialists rightly explain as the source of profit on capital, but
> wrongly interpret . . . as the result of a robbery or exploitation of
> the working classes by the propertied classes."* [**The Positive
> Theory of Capital**, p. 301]

The capitalists are justified in keeping this surplus value because they
provided the time required for the production process to occur. Thus
surplus value is the product of an exchange, the exchange of present
goods for future ones. The capitalist bought labour at its full present
value (i.e. the value of its future product) and so there is no
exploitation as the future goods are slowly maturing during the process
of production and can then be sold at its full value as a present
commodity. Profit, like interest, is seen as resulting from varying
estimates of the present and future needs.

As should be obvious, our criticisms of the "waiting" theory of interest
apply to this justification of profits. Money in itself does not produce
profit any more than interest. It can only do that when invested in
**actual** means of production which are put to work by actual people.
As such, "time preference" only makes sense in an economy where there is
a class of property-less people who are unable to "wait" for future
goods as they would have died of starvation long before they arrived.

So it is the **class** position of workers which explains their time
preferences, as Böhm-Bawerk **himself** acknowledged. Thus capitalism
was marked by an *"enormous number of wage-earners who cannot employ
their labour remuneratively by working on their own account, and are
accordingly, as a body, inclined and ready to sell the future product of
their labour for a considerably less amount of present goods."* So,
being poor, meant that they lacked the resources to "wait" for "future"
goods and so became dependent (as a class) on those who do. This was, in
his opinion the *"sole ground of that much-talked-of and much-deplored
dependence of labourer on capitalist."* It is *"only because the
labourers cannot wait till the roundabout process . . . delivers up its
products ready for consumption, that they become economically dependent
on the capitalists who already hold in their possession what we have
called 'intermediate products.'"* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 330 and p. 83]

Böhm-Bawerk, ironically, simply repeats (although in different words)
**and agrees** with the socialist critique of capitalism which, as we
discussed in [section C.2.2](secC2.html#secc22), is also rooted in the
class dependence of workers to capitalists (Bakunin, for example, argued
that the capitalists were *"profiting by the economic dependence of the
worker"* in order to exploit them by *"turn[ing] the worker into a
subordinate."* [**The Political Philosophy of Bakunin**, p. 188]). The
difference is that Böhm-Bawerk thinks that the capitalists deserve their
income from wealth while anarchists, like other socialists, argue they
do not as they simply are being rewarded for being wealthy. Böhm-Bawerk
simply cannot bring himself to acknowledge that an individual's
psychology, their subjective evaluations, are conditioned by their
social circumstances and so cannot comprehend the **class** character of
capitalism and profit. After all, a landless worker will, of course,
estimate the "sacrifice" or "disutility" of selling their labour to a
master as much less than the peasant farmer or artisan who possesses
their own land or tools. The same can be said of workers organised into
a union.

As such, Böhm-Bawerk ignores the obvious, that the source of non-labour
income is not in individual subjective evaluations but rather the
**social** system within which people live. The worker does not sell her
labour power because she "underestimates" the value of future goods but
because she lacks the means of obtaining any sort of goods at all except
by the selling of her labour power. There is no real choice between
producing for herself or working for a boss -- she has no real
opportunity of doing the former at all and so **has** to do the latter.
This means that workers sells their labour (future goods) "voluntarily"
for an amount less than its value (present goods) because their class
position ensures that they cannot "wait." So, if profit is the price of
time, then it is a monopoly price produced by the class monopoly of
wealth ownership under capitalism. Needless to say, as capital is
accumulated from surplus value, the dependence of the working class on
the capitalists will tend to grow over time as the "waiting" required to
go into business will tend to increase also.

An additional irony of Böhm-Bawerk's argument is that is very similar to
the "abstinence" theory he so rightly mocked and which he admitted the
socialists were right to reject. This can be seen from one of his
followers, right-"libertarian" Murray Rothbard:

> *"What has been the contribution of these product-owners, or
> 'capitalists', to the production process? It is this: the saving and
> restriction of consumption, instead of being done by the owners of
> land and labour, has been done by the **capitalists.** The capitalists
> originally saved, say, 95 ounces of gold which they could have then
> spent on consumers' goods. They refrained from doing so, however, and,
> instead, **advanced** the money to the original owners of the factors.
> They **paid** the latter for their services while they were working,
> thus advancing them money before the product was actually produced and
> sold to the consumers. The capitalists, therefore, made an essential
> contribution to production. They relieved the owners of the original
> factors from the necessity of sacrificing present goods and waiting
> for future goods."* [**Man, Economy, and State**, pp. 294-95]

This meant that without risk, *"[e]ven if financial returns and consumer
demand are certain, **the capitalists are still providing present goods
to the owners of labour and land** and thus relieving them of the burden
of waiting until the future goods are produced and finally transformed
into consumers' goods."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 298] Capitalists pay out,
say, £100,000 this year in wages and reap £200,000 next year not because
of exploitation but because both parties prefer this amount of money
this year rather than next year. Capitalists, in other words, pay out
wages in advance and then wait for a sale. They will only do so if
compensated by profit.

Rothbard's argument simply assumes a **class** system in which there is
a minority of rich and a majority of property-less workers. The reason
why workers cannot "wait" is because if they did they would starve to
death. Unsurprisingly, then, they prefer their wages now rather than
next year. Similarly, the reason why they do not save and form their own
co-operatives is that they simply cannot "wait" until their workplace is
ready and their products are sold before eating and paying rent. In
other words, their decisions are rooted in their class position while
the capitalists (the rich) have shouldered the "burden" of abstinence so
that they can be rewarded with even more money in the future. Clearly,
the time preference position and the "waiting" or "abstinence"
perspective are basically the same (Rothbard even echoes Senior's lament
about the improvident working class, arguing that *"the major problem
with the lower-class poor is irresponsible present-mindedness."* [**For
a New Liberty**, p. 154]). As such, it is subject to the same critique
(as can be found in, say, the works of a certain Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk).

In other words, profit has a **social** basis, rooted in the different
economic situation of classes within capitalism. It is not the fact of
"waiting" which causes profits but rather the monopoly of the means of
life by the capitalist class which is the basis of *"economic
dependence."* Any economic theory which fails to acknowledge and analyse
this social inequality is doomed to failure from the start.

To conclude, the arguments that "waiting" or "time preference" explain
or justify surplus value are deeply flawed simply because they ignore
the reality of class society. By focusing on individual subjective
evaluations, they ignore the social context in which these decisions are
made and, as a result, fail to take into account the class character of
interest and profit. In effect, they argue that the wealthy deserve a
reward for being wealthy. Whether it is to justify profits or interest,
the arguments used simply show that we have an economic system that
works only by bribing the rich!

C.2.8 Are profits the result of entrepreneurial activity and innovation?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

One of the more common arguments in favour of profits is the notion that
they are the result of innovation or entrepreneurial activity, that the
creative spirit of the capitalist innovates profits into existence. This
perspective is usually associated with the so-called "Austrian" school
of capitalist economics but has become more common in the mainstream of
economics, particularly since the 1970s.

There are two related themes in this defence of profits -- innovation
and entrepreneurial activity. While related, they differ in one key way.
The former (associated with Joseph Schumpeter) is rooted in production
while the former seeks to be of more general application. Both are based
on the idea of "discovery", the subjective process by which people use
their knowledge to identify gaps in the market, new products or services
or new means of producing existing goods. When entrepreneurs discover,
for example, a use of resources, they bring these resources into a new
(economic) existence. Accordingly, they have created something **ex
nihilo** (out of nothing) and therefore are entitled to the associated
profit on generally accepted moral principle of *"finders keepers."*

Anarchists, needless to say, have some issues with such an analysis. The
most obvious objection is that while *"finders keepers"* may be an
acceptable ethical position on the playground, it is hardly a firm basis
to justify an economic system marked by inequalities of liberty and
wealth. Moreover, discovering something does **not** entitle you to an
income from it. Take, for example, someone who discovers a flower in a
wood. That, in itself, will generate no income of any kind. Unless the
flower is picked and taken to a market, the discoverer cannot "profit"
from discovering it. If the flower is left untouched then it is
available for others to appropriate unless some means are used to stop
them (such as guarding the flower). This means, of course, limiting the
discovery potential of others, like the state enforcing copyright stops
the independent discovery of the same idea, process or product.

As such, "discovery" is not sufficient to justify non-labour income as
an idea remains an idea unless someone applies it. To generate an income
(profit) from a discovery you need to somehow take it to the market and,
under capitalism, this means getting funds to invest in machinery and
workplaces. However, these in themselves do nothing and, consequently,
workers need to be employed to produce the goods in question. If the
costs of producing these goods is less than the market price, then a
profit is made. Does this profit represent the initial "discovery"?
Hardly for without funds the idea would have remained just that. Does
the profit represent the contribution of "capital"? Hardly, for without
the labour of the workers the workplace would have remained still and
the product would have remained an idea.

Which brings us to the next obvious problem, namely that
"entrepreneurial" activity becomes meaningless when divorced from owning
capital. This is because any action which is taken to benefit an
individual and involves "discovery" is considered entrepreneurial.
Successfully looking for a better job? Your new wages are
entrepreneurial profit. Indeed, successfully finding **any** job makes
the wages entrepreneurial profit. Workers successfully organising and
striking to improve their pay and conditions? An entrepreneurial act
whose higher wages are, in fact, entrepreneurial profit. Selling your
shares in one company and buying others? Any higher dividends are
entrepreneurial profit. Not selling your shares? Likewise. What income
flow could **not** be explained by "entrepreneurial" activity if we try
hard enough?

In other words, the term becomes meaningless unless it is linked to
owning capital and so any non-trivial notion of entrepreneurial activity
requires private property, i.e. property which functions as capital.
This can be seen from an analysis of whether entrepreneurship which is
**not** linked to owning capital or land creates surplus value (profits)
or not. It is possible, for example, that an entrepreneur can make a
profit by buying cheap in one market and selling dear in another.
However, this simply redistributes existing products and surplus value,
it does not **create** them. This means that the entrepreneur does not
create something from nothing, he takes something created by others and
sells it at a higher price and so gains a slice of the surplus value
created by others. If buying high and selling low **was** the cause of
surplus value, then profits overall would be null as any gainer would be
matched by a loser. Ironically, for all its talk of being concerned
about process, this defence of entrepreneurial profits rests on the same
a **static** vision of capitalism as does neo-classical economics.

Thus entrepreneurship is inherently related to inequalities in economic
power, with those at the top of the market hierarchy having more ability
to gain benefits of it than those at the bottom. Entrepreneurship, in
other words, rather than an independent factor is rooted in social
inequality. The larger one's property, the more able they are to gather
and act on information advantages, i.e. act in as an entrepreneur.
Moreover the ability to exercise the entrepreneurial spirit or innovate
is restricted by the class system of capitalism. To implement a new
idea, you need money. As it is extremely difficult for entrepreneurs to
act on the opportunities they have observed without the ownership of
property, so profits due to innovation simply becomes yet another reward
for already being wealthy or, at best, being able to convince the
wealthy to loan you money in the expectation of a return. Given that
credit is unlikely to be forthcoming to those without collateral (and
most working class people are asset-poor), entrepreneurs are almost
always capitalists because of social inequality. Entrepreneurial
opportunities are, therefore, not available to everyone and so it is
inherently linked to private property (i.e. capital).

So while entrepreneurship in the abstract may help explain the
distribution of income, it neither explains why surplus value exists in
the first place nor does it justify the entrepreneur's appropriation of
part of that surplus. To explain why surplus value exists and why
capitalists may be justified in keeping it, we need to look at the other
aspect of entrepreneurship, innovation as this is rooted in the actual
production process.

Innovation occurs in order to expand profits and so survive competition
from other companies. While profits can be redistributed in circulation
(for example by oligopolistic competition or inflation) this can only
occur at the expense of other people or capitals (see sections
[C.5](secC5.html) and [C.7](secC7.html)). Innovation, however, allows
the generation of profits directly from the new or increased
productivity (i.e. exploitation) of labour it allows. This is because it
is in production that commodities, and so profits, are created and
innovation results in new products and/or new production methods. New
products mean that the company can reap excess profits until competitors
enter the new market and force the market price down by competition. New
production methods allow the intensity of labour to be increased,
meaning that workers do more work relative to their wages (in other
words, the cost of production falls relative to the market price,
meaning extra profits).

So while competition ensures that capitalist firms innovate, innovation
is the means by which companies can get an edge in the market. This is
because innovation means that *"capitalist excess profits come from the
production process. . . when there is an above-average rise in labour
productivity; the reduced costs then enable firms to earn higher than
average profits in their products. But this form of excess profits is
only temporary and disappears again when improved production methods
become more general."* [Paul Mattick, **Economics, Politics and the Age
of Inflation**, p. 38] Capitalists, of course, use a number of
techniques to stop the spread of new products or production methods in
order to maintain their position, such as state enforced intellectual
property rights.

Innovation as the source of profits is usually associated with economist
Joseph Schumpeter who described and praised capitalism's genius for
*"creative destruction"* caused by capitalists who innovate, i.e.
introduce new goods and means of production. Schumpeter's analysis of
capitalism is more realistic than the standard neo-classical
perspective. He recognised that capitalism was marked by a business
cycle which he argued flowed from cycles of innovation conducted by
capitalists. He also rejected the neo-classical assumption of perfect
competition, arguing that the *"introduction of new methods of
production and new commodities is hardly compatible with perfect and
perfectly prompt competition from the start . . . As a matter of fact,
perfect competition has always been temporarily stemmed whenever
anything new is being introduced."* [**Capitalism, Socialism and
Democracy**, p. 104]

This analysis presents a picture of capitalism more like it actually is
rather than what economics would like it to be. However, this does not
mean that its justification for profits is correct, far from it.
Anarchists do agree that it is true that individuals do see new
potential and act in innovative ways to create new products or
processes. However, this is not the source of surplus value. This is
because an innovation only becomes a source of profits once it actually
produced, i.e. once workers have toiled to create it (in the case of new
goods) or used it (in the case of new production techniques). An idea in
and of itself produces nothing unless it is applied. The reason why
profits result from innovation is due to the way the capitalist firm is
organised rather than any inherent aspect of innovation.

Ultimately, entrepreneurialism is just a fancy name for decision making
and, as such, it is a **labour** income (labour refers to physical
**and** mental activities). However, as noted above, there are two types
of labour under capitalism, the labour of production and the labour of
exploitation. Looking at entrepreneurialism in a workplace situation, it
is obvious that it is **not** independent of owning or managing capital
and so it is impossible to distinguish profits produced by
"entrepreneurial" activity and profits resulting from a return on
property (and so the labour of others). In other words, it is the labour
of exploitation and any income from it is simply monopoly profit. This
is because the capitalist or manager has a monopoly of power within the
workplace and, consequently, can reap the benefits this privileged
position ensures. The workers have their opportunities for
entrepreneurialism restricted and monopolised by the few in power who,
when deciding who contributes most to production, strangely enough
decide it is themselves.

This can be seen from the fact that innovation in terms of new
technology is used to help win the class war at the point of production
for the capitalists. As the aim of capitalist production is to maximise
the profits available for capitalists and management to control, it
follows that capitalism will introduce technology that will allow more
surplus value to be extracted from workers. As Cornelius Castoriadis
argues, capitalism *"does not utilise a socially neutral technology for
capitalist ends. Capitalism has created capitalist technology, which is
by no means neutral. The real essence of capitalist technology is not to
develop production for production's sake: It is to subordinate and
dominate the producers."* [**Political and Social Writings**, vol. 2, p.
104] Therefore, "innovation" (technological improvement) can be used to
increase the power of capital over the workforce, to ensure that workers
will do as they are told. In this way innovation can maximise surplus
value production by trying to increase domination during working hours
as well as by increasing productivity by new processes.

These attempts to increase profits by using innovation is the key to
capitalist expansion and accumulation. As such innovation plays a key
role within the capitalist system. However, the source of profits does
not change and remains in the labour, skills and creativity of workers
in the workplace. As such, innovation results in profits because labour
is exploited in the production process, **not** due to some magical
property of innovation.

The question now arises whether profits are justified as a reward for
those who made the decision to innovate in the first place. This,
however, fails for the obvious reason that capitalism is marked by a
hierarchical organisation of production. It is designed so that a few
make all the decisions while the majority are excluded from power. As
such, to say that capitalists or managers deserve their profits due to
innovation is begging the question. Profits which are claimed to flow
from innovation are, in fact, the reward for having a monopoly, namely
the monopoly of decision making within the workplace, rather than some
actual contribution to production. The only thing management does is
decide which innovations to pursue and to reap the benefits they create.
In other words, they gain a reward simply due to their monopoly of
decision making power within a firm. Yet this hierarchy only exists
because of capitalism and so can hardly be used to defend that system
and the appropriation of surplus value by capitalists.

Thus, if entrepreneurial spirit is the source of profit then we can
reply that under capitalism the means of exercising that spirit is
monopolised by certain classes and structures. The monopoly of decision
making power in the hands of managers and bosses in a capitalist firm
ensure that they also monopolise the rewards of the entrepreneurialism
their workforce produce. This, in turn, reduces the scope for innovation
as this division of society into people who do mental and physical
labour *"destroy[s] the love of work and the capacity for invention"*
and under such a system, the worker *"lose[s] his intelligence and his
spirit of invention."* [Kropotkin, **The Conquest of Bread**, p. 183 and
p. 181]

These issues should be a key concern **if** entrepreneurialism
**really** were considered as the unique source of profit. However, such
issues as management power is rarely, if ever, discussed by the Austrian
school. While they thunder against state restrictions on entrepreneurial
activity, boss and management restrictions are always defended (if
mentioned at all). Similarly, they argue that state intervention (say,
anti-monopoly laws) can only harm consumers as it tends to discourage
entrepreneurial activity yet ignore the restrictions to entrepreneurship
imposed by inequality, the hierarchical structure of the capitalist
workplace and negative effects both have on individuals and their
development (as discussed in [section B.1.1](secB1.html#secb11)).

This, we must stress, is the key problem with the idea that innovation
is the root of surplus value. It focuses attention to the top of the
capitalist hierarchy, to business leaders. This implies that they, the
bosses, create "wealth" and without them nothing would be done. For
example, leading "Austrian" economist Israel Kirzner talks of *"the
necessarily indivisible entrepreneur"* who *"is responsible for the
entire product, The contributions of the factor inputs, being without an
entrepreneurial component, are irrelevant for the ethical position being
taken."* [*"Producer, Entrepreneur, and the Right to Property,"* pp.
185-199, **Perception, Opportunity, and Profit**, p. 195] The workforce
is part of the *"factor inputs"* who are considered *"irrelevant."* He
quotes economist Frank Knight to bolster this analysis that the
entrepreneur solely creates wealth and, consequently, deserves his
profits:

> *"Under the enterprise system, a special social class, the
> businessman, direct economic activity: **they are in the strict sense
> the producers, while the great mass of the population merely furnishes
> them with productive services, placing their persons and their
> property at the disposal of this class.**"* [quoted by Kirzner, **Op.
> Cit.**, p. 189]

If, as Chomsky stresses, the capitalist firm is organised in a fascist
way, the "entrepreneurial" defence of profits is its ideology, its
**"Führerprinzip"** (the German for *"leader principle"*). This ideology
sees each organisation as a hierarchy of leaders, where every leader
(Führer, in German) has absolute responsibility in his own area, demands
absolute obedience from those below him and answers only to his
superiors. This ideology was most infamously applied by fascism but its
roots lie in military organisations which continue to use a similar
authority structure today.

Usually defenders of capitalism contrast the joys of "individualism"
with the evils of "collectivism" in which the individual is sub-merged
into the group or collective and is made to work for the benefit of the
group. Yet when it comes to capitalist industry, they stress the
abilities of the people at the top of the company, the owner, the
entrepreneur, and treat as unpeople those who do the actual work (and
ignore the very real subordination of those lower down the hierarchy).
The entrepreneur is considered the driving force of the market process
and the organisations and people they govern are ignored, leading to the
impression that the accomplishments of a firm are the personal triumphs
of the capitalists, as though their subordinates are merely tools not
unlike the machines on which they labour.

The ironic thing about this argument is that if it were true, then the
economy would grind to a halt (we discuss this more fully in our
critique of Engels's diatribe against anarchism *"On Authority"* in
[section H.4.4](secH4.html#sech44)). It exposes a distinct contradiction
within capitalism. While the advocates of entrepreneurialism assert that
the entrepreneur is the only real producer of wealth in society, the
fact is that the entrepreneurialism of the workforce industry is
required to implement the decisions made by the bosses. Without this
unacknowledged input, the entrepreneur would be impotent. Kropotkin
recognised this fact when he talked of the workers *"who have added to
the original invention"* little additions and contributions *"without
which the most fertile idea would remain fruitless."* Nor does the idea
itself develop out of nothing as *"every invention is a synthesis, the
resultant of innumerable inventions which have preceded it."* [**Op.
Cit.**, p. 30] Thus Cornelius Castoriadis:

> *"The capitalist organisation of production is profoundly
> contradictory . . . It claims to reduce the worker to a limited and
> determined set of tasks, but it is obliged at the same time to rely
> upon the universal capacities he develops both as a function of and in
> opposition to the situation in which he is placed . . . Production can
> be carried out only insofar as the worker himself organises his work
> and goes beyond his theoretical role of pure and simply executant,"*
> [**Political and Social Writings**, vol. 2, p. 181]

Moreover, such a hierarchical organisation cannot help but generate
wasted potential. Most innovation is the cumulative effect of lots of
incremental process improvements and the people most qualified to
identify opportunities for such improvements are, obviously, those
involved in the process. In the hierarchical capitalist firm, those most
aware of what would improve efficiency have the least power to do
anything about it. They also have the least incentive as well as any
productivity increases resulting from their improvements will almost
always enrich their bosses and investors, not them. Indeed, any gains
may be translated into layoffs, soaring stock prices, and senior
management awarding itself a huge bonus for "cutting costs." What worker
in his right mind would do something to help their worst enemy? As such,
capitalism hinders innovation:

> *"capitalism divides society into a narrow stratum of directors (whose
> function is to decide and organise everything) and the vast majority
> of the population, who are reduced to carrying out (executing) the
> decisions made by these directors. As a result of this very fact, most

> **necessarily** engenders opposition, a struggle against it by those
> upon whom it seeks to impose itself . . . The net result is not only
> waste but perpetual conflict."* [Castoriadis, **Op. Cit.**, p. 93]

While workers make the product and make entrepreneurial decisions every
day, in the face of opposition of the company hierarchy, the benefits of
those decisions are monopolised by the few who take all the glory for
themselves. The question now becomes, why should capitalists and
managers have a monopoly of power and profits when, in practice, they do
not and cannot have a monopoly of entrepreneurialism within a workplace?
If the output of a workplace is the result of the combined mental and
physical activity (entrepreneurialism) of all workers, there is no
justification either for the product or "innovation" (i.e. decision
making power) to be monopolised by the few.

We must also stress that innovation itself is a form of labour -- mental
labour. Indeed, many companies have Research and Development groups in
which workers are paid to generate new and innovative ideas for their
employers. This means that innovation is not related to property
ownership at all. In most modern industries, as Schumpeter himself
acknowledged, innovation and technical progress is conducted by *"teams
of trained specialists, who turn out what is required and make it work
in predictable ways"* and so *"[b]ureau and committee work tends to
replace individual action."* This meant that *"the leading man . . . is
becoming just another office worker -- and one who is not always
difficult to replace."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 133] And we must also point
out that many new innovations come from individuals who combine mental
and physical labour outside of capitalist companies. Given this, it is
difficult to argue that profits are the result of innovation of a few
exceptional people rather than by workers when the innovations, as well
as being worked or produced by workers are themselves are created by
teams of workers.

As such, "innovation" and "entrepreneurialism" is not limited to a few
great people but rather exists in all of us. While the few may currently
monopolise "entrepreneurialism" for their own benefit, an economy does
not need to work this way. Decision making need **not** be centralised
in a few hands. Ordinary workers can manage their own productive
activity, innovate and make decisions to meet social and individual
needs (i.e. practice "entrepreneurialism"). This can be seen from
various experiments in workers' control where increased equality within
the workplace actually increases productivity and innovation. As these
experiments show workers, when given the chance, can develop numerous
"good ideas" **and**, equally as important, produce them. A capitalist
with a "good idea," on the other hand, would be powerless to produce it
without workers and it is this fact that shows that innovation, in and
of itself, is not the source of surplus value.

So, contrary to much capitalist apologetics, innovation is not the
monopoly of an elite class of humans. It is part of all of us, although
the necessary social environment needed to nurture and develop it in all
is crushed by the authoritarian workplaces of capitalism and the effects
of inequalities of wealth and power within society as a whole. If
workers were truly incapable of innovation, any shift toward greater
control of production by workers should result in decreased
productivity. What one actually finds, however, is just the opposite:
productivity increased dramatically as ordinary people were given the
chance, usually denied them, to apply their skills and talents. They
show the kind of ingenuity and creativity people naturally bring to a
challenging situation -- if they are allowed to, if they are
participants rather than servants or subordinates.

In fact, there is *"a growing body of empirical literature that is
generally supportive of claims for the economic efficiency of the
labour-managed firm. Much of this literature focuses on productivity,
frequently finding it to be positively correlated with increasing levels
of participation . . . Studies that encompass a range of issues broader
than the purely economic also tend to support claims for the efficiency
of labour managed and worker-controlled firms . . . In addition, studies
that compare the economic preference of groups of traditionally and
worker-controlled forms point to the stronger performance of the
latter."* [Christopher Eaton Gunn, **Workers' Self-Management in the
United States**, pp. 42-3] This is confirmed by David Noble, who points
out that *"the self-serving claim"* that *"centralised management
authority is the key to productivity"* is *"belied by nearly every
sociological study of work."* [**Progress without People**, p. 65]

During the Spanish Revolution of 1936-39, workers self-managed many
factories following the principles of participatory democracy.
Productivity and innovation in the Spanish collectives was exceptionally
high (particularly given the difficult economic and political situation
they faced). As Jose Peirats notes, industry was *"transformed from top
to bottom . . . there were achieved feats pregnant with significance for
people who had always striven to deny the reality of the wealth of
popular initiatives unveiled by revolutions."* Workers made suggestions
and presented new inventions, *"offering the product of their
discoveries, genius or imaginings."* [**The CNT in the Spanish
Revolution**, vol. 2, p. 86]

The metal-working industry is a good example. As Augustine Souchy
observes, at the outbreak of the Civil War, the metal industry in
Catalonia was *"very poorly developed."* Yet within months, the
Catalonian metal workers had rebuilt the industry from scratch,
converting factories to the production of war materials for the
anti-fascist troops. A few days after the July 19th revolution, the
Hispano-Suiza Automobile Company was already converted to the
manufacture of armoured cars, ambulances, weapons, and munitions for the
fighting front. *"Experts were truly astounded,"* Souchy writes, *"at
the expertise of the workers in building new machinery for the
manufacture of arms and munitions. Very few machines were imported. In a
short time, two hundred different hydraulic presses of up to 250 tons
pressure, one hundred seventy-eight revolving lathes, and hundreds of
milling machines and boring machines were built."* [**The Anarchist
Collectives: Workers' Self-management in the Spanish Revolution,
1936-1939**, Sam Dolgoff (ed.), p. 96]

Similarly, there was virtually no optical industry in Spain before the
July revolution, only some scattered workshops. After the revolution,
the small workshops were voluntarily converted into a production
collective. *"The greatest innovation,"* according to Souchy, *"was the
construction of a new factory for optical apparatuses and instruments.
The whole operation was financed by the voluntary contributions of the
workers. In a short time the factory turned out opera glasses,
telemeters, binoculars, surveying instruments, industrial glassware in
different colours, and certain scientific instruments. It also
manufactured and repaired optical equipment for the fighting fronts . .
. What private capitalists failed to do was accomplished by the creative
capacity of the members of the Optical Workers' Union of the CNT."*
[**Op. Cit.**, pp. 98-99]

More recently, the positive impact of workers' control has been
strikingly confirmed in studies of the Mondragon co-operatives in Spain,
where workers are democratically involved in production decisions and
encouraged to innovate. As George Bennello notes, *"Mondragon
productivity is very high -- higher than in its capitalist counterparts.
Efficiency, measured as the ratio of utilised resources -- capital and
labour -- to output, is far higher than in comparable capitalist
factories."* [*"The Challenge of Mondragon"*, **Reinventing Anarchy,
Again**, p. 216]

The example of Lucas Aerospace, during the 1970s indicates well the
creative potential waiting to be utilised and wasted due to capitalism.
Faced with massive job cuts and restructuring, the workers and their
Shop Stewards SSCC in 1976 proposed an alternative Corporate Plan to
Lucas's management. This was the product of two years planning and
debate among Lucas workers. Everyone from unionised engineers, to
technicians to production workers and secretaries was involved in
drawing it up. It was based on detailed information on the machinery and
equipment that all Lucas sites had, as well as the type of skills that
were in the company. The workers designed the products themselves, using
their own experiences of work and life. While its central aim was to
head off Lucas's planned job cuts, it presented a vision of a better
world by arguing that the concentration on military goods and markets
was neither the best use of resources nor in itself desirable. It argued
that if Lucas was to look away from military production it could expand
into markets for socially useful goods (such as medical equipment) where
it already had some expertise and sales. The management were not
interested, it was their to "manage" Lucas and to decide where its
resources would be used, including the 18,000 people working there.
Management were more than happy to exclude the workforce from any say in
such fundamental matter as implementing the workers' ideas would have
shown how unnecessary they, the bosses, actually were.

Another example of wasted worker innovation is provided by the US car
industry. In the 1960s, Walter Reuther, president of the United Auto
Workers (UAW) had proposed to the Johnson Whitehouse that the government
help the US car companies to produce small cars, competing with
Volkswagen which had enjoyed phenomenal success in the U.S. market. The
project, unsurprisingly, fell through as the executives of the car
companies were uninterested. In the 1970s, higher petrol prices saw US
buyers opt for smaller cars and the big US manufacturers were caught
unprepared. This allowed Toyota, Honda and other Asian car companies to
gain a crucial foothold in the American market. Unsurprisingly,
resistance by the union and workforce were blamed for the industry's
problems when, in fact, it was the bosses, not the unions, who were
blind to a potential market niche and the industry's competitive
challenges.

Therefore, far from being a threat to innovation, workers'
self-management would increase it and, more importantly, direct it
towards improving the quality of life for all as opposed to increasing
the profits of the few (this aspect an anarchist society will be
discussed in more detail in [section I](secIcon.html)). This should be
unsurprising, as vesting a minority with managerial authority and
deciding that the others should be cogs results in a massive loss of
social initiative and drive. In addition, see sections
[J.5.10](secJ5.html#secj510), [J.5.11](secJ5.html#secj511) and
[J.5.12](secJ5.html#secj512) for more on why anarchists support
self-management and why, in spite of its higher efficiency and
productivity, the capitalist market will select against it.

To conclude, capitalist workplace hierarchy actually hinders innovation
and efficiency rather than fosters it. To defend profits by appealing to
innovation is, in such circumstances, deeply ironic. Not only does it
end up simply justifying profits in terms of monopoly power (i.e.
hierarchical decision making rewarding itself), that power also wastes a
huge amount of potential innovation in society -- namely the ideas and
experience of the workforce excluded from the decision making process.
Given that power produces resistance, capitalism ensures that the
*"creative faculties [the workers] are not allowed to exercise **on
behalf** of a social order that rejects them (and which they reject) are
now utilised **against** that social order"* and so *"work under
capitalism"* is *"a perpetual waste of creative capacity, and a constant
struggle between the worker and his own activity."* [Castoriadis, **Op.
Cit.**, p. 93 and p. 94]

Therefore, rather than being a defence of capitalist profit taking (and
the inequality it generates) innovation backfires against capitalism.
Innovation flourishes best under freedom and this points towards
libertarian socialism and workers' self-management. Given the chance,
workers can manage their own work and this results in increased
innovation and productivity, so showing that capitalist monopoly of
decision making power hinders both. This is unsurprising, for only
equality can maximise liberty and so workers' control (rather than
capitalist power) is the key to innovation. Only those who confuse
freedom with the oppression of wage labour would be surprised by this.

C.2.9 Do profits reflect a reward for risk?
-------------------------------------------

Another common justification of surplus value is that of "risk taking",
namely the notion that non-labour income is justified because its owners
took a risk in providing money and deserve a reward for so doing.

Before discussing why anarchists reject this argument, it must be noted
that in the mainstream neo-classical model, risk and uncertainty plays
no role in generating profits. According to general equilibrium theory,
there is no uncertainty (the present and future are known) and so there
is no role for risk. As such, the concept of profits being related to
risk is more realistic than the standard model. However, as we will
argue, such an argument is unrealistic in many other ways, particularly
in relation to modern-day corporate capitalism.

It is fair to say that the appeal of risk to explain and justify profits
lies almost entirely in the example of the small investor who gambles
their savings (for example, by opening a bar) and face a major risk if
the investment does not succeed. However, in spite of the emotional
appeal of such examples, anarchists argue that they are hardly typical
of investment decisions and rewards within capitalism. In fact, such
examples are used precisely to draw attention away from the way the
system works rather than provide an insight into it. That is, the higher
apparent realism of the argument hides an equally unreal model of
capitalism as the more obviously unrealistic theories which seek to
rationalise non-labour income.

So does "risk" explain or justify non-labour income? No, anarchists
argue. This is for five reasons. Firstly, the returns on property income
are utterly independent on the amount of risk involved. Secondly, all
human acts involve risk of some kind and so why should property owners
gain exclusively from it? Thirdly, risk as such it not rewarded, only
**successful** risks are and what constitutes success is dependent on
production, i.e. exploiting labour. Fourthly, most "risk" related
non-labour income today plays **no** part in aiding production and,
indeed, is simply not that risky due to state intervention. Fifthly,
risk in this context is not independent of owning capital and,
consequently, the arguments against "waiting" and innovation apply
equally to this rationale. In other words, "risk" is simply yet another
excuse to reward the rich for being wealthy.

The first objection is the most obvious. It is a joke to suggest that
capitalism rewards in proportion to risk. There is little or no
relationship between income and the risk that person faces. Indeed, it
would be fairer to say that return is **inversely** proportional to the
amount of risk a person faces. The most obvious example is that of a
worker who wants to be their own boss and sets up their own business.
That is a genuine risk, as they are risking their savings and are
willing to go into debt. Compare this to a billionaire investor with
millions of shares in hundreds of companies. While the former struggles
to make a living, the latter gets a large regular flow of income without
raising a finger. In terms of risk, the investor is wealthy enough to
have spread their money so far that, in practical terms, there is none.
Who has the larger income?

As such, the risk people face is dependent on their existing wealth and
so it is impossible to determine any relationship between it and the
income it is claimed to generate. Given that risk is inherently
subjective, there is no way of discovering its laws of operation except
by begging the question and using the actual rate of profits to measure
the cost of risk-bearing.

The second objection is equally as obvious. The suggestion that risk
taking is the source and justification for profits ignores the fact that
virtually all human activity involves risk. To claim that capitalists
should be paid for the risks associated with investment is to implicitly
state that money is more valuable that human life. After all, workers
risk their health and often their lives in work and often the most
dangerous workplaces are those associated with the lowest pay. Moreover,
providing safe working conditions can eat into profits and by cutting
health and safety costs, profits can rise. This means that to reward
capitalist "risk", the risk workers face may actually increase. In the
inverted world of capitalist ethics, it is usually cheaper (or more
"efficient") to replace an individual worker than a capital investment.
Unlike investors, bosses and the corporate elite, workers **do** face
risk to life or limb daily as part of their work. Life is risky and no
life is more risky that that of a worker who may be ruined by the
"risky" decisions of management, capitalists and investors seeking to
make their next million. While it is possible to diversify the risk in
holding a stock portfolio that is not possible with a job. A job cannot
be spread across a wide array of companies diversifying risk.

In other words, workers face much greater risks than their employers
and, moreover, they have no say in what risks will be taken with their
lives and livelihoods. It is workers who pay the lion's share of the
costs of failure, not management and stockholders. When firms are in
difficulty, it is the workers who are asked to pay for the failures of
management though pay cuts and the elimination of health and other
benefits. Management rarely get pay cuts, indeed they often get bonuses
and "incentive" schemes to get them to do the work they were (over) paid
to do in the first. When a corporate manager makes a mistake and their
business actually fails, his workers will suffer far more serious
consequences than him. In most cases, the manager will still live
comfortably (indeed, many will receive extremely generous severance
packages) while workers will face the fear, insecurity and hardship of
having to find a new job. Indeed, as we argued in [section
C.2.1](secC2.html#secc21), it is the risk of unemployment that is a key
factor in ensuring the exploitation of labour in the first place.

As production is inherently collective under capitalism, so must be the
risk. As Proudhon put it, it may be argued that the capitalist *"alone
runs the risk of the enterprise"* but this ignores the fact that
capitalist cannot *"alone work a mine or run a railroad"* nor *"alone
carry on a factory, sail a ship, play a tragedy, build the Pantheon."*
He asked: *"Can anybody do such things as these, even if he has all the
capital necessary?"* And so *"association"* becomes *"absolutely
necessary and right"* as the *"work to be accomplished"* is *"the common
and undivided property of all those who take part therein."* If not,
shareholders would *"plunder the bodies and souls of the wage-workers"*
and it would be *"an outrage upon human dignity and personality."*
[**The General Idea of the Revolution**, p. 219] In other words, as
production is collective, so is the risk faced and, consequently, risk
cannot be used to justify excluding people from controlling their own
working lives or the fruit of their labour.

This brings us to the third reason, namely how "risk" contributes to
production. The idea that "risk" is a contribution to production is
equally flawed. Obviously, no one argues that **failed** investments
should result in investors being rewarded for the risks they took. This
means that **successful** risks are what counts and this means that the
company has produced a desired good or service. In other words, the
argument for risk is dependent on the investor providing capital which
the workers of the company used productivity to create a commodity.
However, as we discussed in [section C.2.4](secC2.html#secc24) capital
is **not** productive and, as a result, an investor may expect the
return of their initial investment but no more. At best, the investor
has allowed others to use their money but, as [section
C.2.3](secC2.html#secc23) indicated, giving permission to use something
is not a productive act.

However, there is another sense in which risk does not, in general,
contribute to production within capitalism, namely finance markets. This
bring us to our fourth objection, namely that most kinds of "risks"
within capitalism do **not** contribute to production and, thanks to
state aid, not that risky.

Looking at the typical "risk" associated with capitalism, namely putting
money into the stock market and buying shares, the idea that "risk"
contributes to production is seriously flawed. As David Schweickart
points out, *"[i]n the vast majority of cases, when you buy stock, you
give your money not to the company but to another private individual.
You buy your share of stock from someone who is cashing in his share.
Not a nickel of your money goes to the company itself. The company's
profits would have been exactly the same, with or without your stock
purchase."* [**After Capitalism**, p. 37] In fact between 1952 and 1997,
about 92% of investment was paid for by firms' own internal funds and so
*"the stock market contributes virtually nothing to the financing of
outside investment."* Even new stock offerings only accounted for 4% of
non-financial corporations capital expenditures. [Doug Henwood, **Wall
Street**, p. 72] *"In spite of the stock market's large symbolic value,
it is notorious that it has relatively little to do with the production
of goods and services,"* notes David Ellerman, *"The overwhelming bulk
of stock transactions are in second-hand shares so the capital paid for
shares usually goes to other stock traders, not to productive
enterprises issuing new shares."* [**The Democratic worker-owned firm**,
p. 199]

In other words, most investment is simply the "risk" associated with
buying a potential income stream in an uncertain world. The buyer's
action has not contributed to producing that income stream in any way
whatsoever yet it results in a claim on the labour of others. At best,
it could be said that a previous owner of the shares at some time in the
past has *"contributed"* to production by providing money but this does
not justify non-labour income. As such, investing in shares may
rearrange existing wealth (often to the great advantage of the
rearrangers) but it does produce anything. New wealth flows from
production, the use of labour on existing wealth to create new wealth.

Ironically, the stock market (and the risk it is based on) harms this
process. The notion that dividends represent the return for "risk" may
be faulted by looking at how the markets operate in reality, rather than
in theory. Stock markets react to recent movements in the price of stock
markets, causing price movements to build upon price movements.
According to academic finance economist Bob Haugen, this results in
finance markets having endogenous instability, with such price-driven
volatility accounting for over three-quarters of all volatility in
finance markets. This leads to the market directing investments very
badly as some investment is wasted in over-valued companies and
under-valued firms cannot get finance to produce useful goods. The
market's endogenous volatility reduces the overall level of investment
as investors will only fund projects which return a sufficiently high
level of return. This results in a serious drag on economic growth. As
such, "risk" has a large and negative impact on the real economy and it
seems ironic to reward such behaviour. Particularly as the high rate of
return is meant to compensate for the risk of investing in the stock
market, but in fact most of this risk results from the endogenous
stability of the market itself. [Steve Keen, **Debunking Economics**,
pp. 249-50]

Appeals to "risk" to justify capitalism are somewhat ironic, given the
dominant organisational form within capitalism -- the corporation. These
firms are based on *"limited liability"* which was designed explicitly
to reduce the risk faced by investors. As Joel Bakan notes, before this
"no matter how much, or how little, a person had invested in a company,
he or she was **personally** liable, without limit, for the company's
debts. Investors' homes, savings, and other personal assess would be
exposed to claims by creditors if a company failed, meaning that a
person risked finance ruin simply by owning shares in a company.
Stockholding could not becomes a truly attractive option . . . until
that risk was removed, which it soon was. By the middle of the
nineteenth century, business leaders and politicians broadly advocated
changing the law to limit the liability of shareholders to the amounts
they had invested in a company. If a person bought \$100 worth of
shares, they reasoned, he or she should be immune to liability for
anything beyond that, regardless of what happened to the company."
Limited liability's *"sole purpose . . . is to shield them from legal
responsibility for corporations' actions"* as well as reducing the risks
of investing (unlike for small businesses). [**The Corporation**, p. 11
and p. 79]

This means that stock holders (investors) in a corporation hold no
liability for the corporation's debts and obligations. As a result of
this state granted privilege, potential losses cannot exceed the amount
which they paid for their shares. The rationale used to justify this is
the argument that without limited liability, a creditor would not likely
allow any share to be sold to a buyer of at least equivalent
creditworthiness as the seller. This means that limited liability allows
corporations to raise funds for riskier enterprises by reducing risks
and costs from the owners and shifting them onto other members of
society (i.e. an externality). It is, in effect, a state granted
privilege to trade with a limited chance of loss but with an unlimited
chance of gain.

This is an interesting double-standard. It suggests that corporations
are not, in fact, owned by shareholders at all since they take on none
of the responsibility of ownership, especially the responsibility to pay
back debts. Why should they have the privilege of getting profit during
good times when they take none of the responsibility during bad times?
Corporations are creatures of government, created with the social
privileges of limited financial liability of shareholders. Since their
debts are ultimately public, why should their profits be private?

Needless to say, this reducing of risk is not limited to within a state,
it is applied internationally as well. Big banks and corporations lend
money to developing nations but *"the people who borrowed the money
[i.e. the local elite] aren't held responsible for it. It's the people .
. . who have to pay [the debts] off . . . The lenders are protected from
risk. That's one of the main functions of the IMF, to provide risk free
insurance to people who lend and invest in risky loans. They earn high
yields because there's a lot of risk, but they don't have to take the
risk, because it's socialised. It's transferred in various ways to
Northern taxpayers through the IMP and other devices . . . The whole
system is one in which the borrowers are released from the
responsibility. That's transferred to the impoverished mass of the
population in their own countries. And the lenders are protected from
risk."* [Noam Chomsky, **Propaganda and the Public Mind**, p. 125]

Capitalism, ironically enough, has developed precisely by externalising
risk and placing the burden onto other parties -- suppliers, creditors,
workers and, ultimately, society as a whole. *"Costs and risks are
socialised,"* in other words, *"and the profit is privatised."* [Noam
Chomsky, **Op. Cit.**, p. 185] To then turn round and justify corporate
profits in terms of risk seems to be hypocritical in the extreme,
particularly by appealing to examples of small business people whom
usually face the burdens caused by corporate externalising of risk! Doug
Henwood states the obvious when he writes shareholder *"liabilities are
limited by definition to what they paid for the shares"* and *"they can
always sell their shares in a troubled firm, and if they have
diversified portfolios, they can handle an occasional wipe-out with
hardly a stumble. Employees, and often customers and suppliers, are
rarely so well-insulated."* Given that the *"signals emitted by the
stock market are either irrelevant or harmful to real economic activity,
and that the stock market itself counts for little or nothing as a
source of finance"* and the argument for risk as a defence of profits is
extremely weak. [**Op. Cit.**, p. 293 and p. 292]

Lastly, the risk theory of profit fails to take into account the
different risk-taking abilities of that derive from the unequal
distribution of society's wealth. As James Meade puts it, while
*"property owners can spread their risks by putting small bits of their
property into a large number of concerns, a worker cannot easily put
small bits of his effort into a large number of different jobs. This
presumably is the main reason we find risk-bearing capital hiring
labour"* and not vice versa. [quoted by David Schweickart, **Against
Capitalism**, pp. 129-130]

It should be noted that until the early nineteenth century,
self-employment was the normal state of affairs and it has declined
steadily to reach, at best, around 10% of the working population in
Western countries today. It would be inaccurate, to say the least, to
explain this decline in terms of increased unwillingness to face
potential risks on the part of working people. Rather, it is a product
of increased costs to set up and run businesses which acts as a very
effect **natural** barrier to competition (see [section
C.4](secC4.html)). With limited resources available, most working people
simply **cannot** face the risk as they do not have sufficient funds in
the first place and, moreover, if such funds are found the market is
hardly a level playing field.

This means that going into business for yourself is always a
possibility, but that option is very difficult without sufficient
assets. Moreover, even if sufficient funds are found (either by savings
or a loan), the risk is extremely high due to the inability to diversify
investments and the constant possibility that larger firms will set-up
shop in your area (for example, Wal-Mart driving out small businesses or
chain pubs, cafes and bars destroying local family businesses). So it is
true that there is a small flow of workers into self-employment
(sometimes called the petit bourgeoisie) and that, of these, a small
amount become full-scale capitalists. However, these are the exceptions
that prove the rule -- there is a greater return into wage slavery as
enterprises fail.

Simply put, the distribution of wealth (and so ability to take risks) is
so skewed that such possibilities are small and, in spite being highly
risky, do not provide sufficient returns to make most of them a success.
That many people **do** risk their savings and put themselves through
stress, insecurity and hardship in this way is, ironically, hardly a
defence of capitalism as it suggests that wage labour is so bad that
many people will chance everything to escape it. Sadly, this natural
desire to be your own boss generally becomes, if successful, being
someone else's boss! Which means, in almost all cases, it shows that to
become rich you need to exploit other people's labour.

So, as with "waiting" (see [section C.2.7](secC2.html#secc27)), taking a
risk is much easier if you are wealthy and so risk is simply another
means for rewarding the wealthy for being wealthy. In other words, risk
aversion is the dependent, not the independent, factor. The distribution
of wealth determines the risks people willing to face and so cannot
explain or justify that wealth. Rather than individual evaluations
determining "risk", these evaluations will be dependent on the class
position of the individuals involved. As Schweickart notes, *"large
numbers of people simply do not have any discretionary funds to invest.
They can't play at all . . . among those who can play, some are better
situated than others. Wealth gives access to information, expert advice,
and opportunities for diversification that the small investor often
lacks."* [**After Capitalism**, p. 34] As such, profits do not reflect
the real cost of risk but rather the scarcity of people with anything to
risk (i.e. inequality of wealth).

Similarly, given that the capitalists (or their hired managers) have a
monopoly of decision making power within a firm, any risks made by a
company reflects that hierarchy. As such, risk and the ability to take
risks are monopolised in a few hands. If profit **is** the product of
risk then, ultimately, it is the product of a hierarchical company
structure and, consequently, capitalists are simply rewarding themselves
because they have power within the workplace. As with "innovation" and
"entrepreneurialism" (see [section C.2.8](secC2.html#secc28)), this
rationale for surplus value depends on ignoring how the workplace is
structured. In other words, because managers monopolise decision making
("risk") they also monopolise the surplus value produced by workers.
However, the former in no way justifies this appropriation nor does it
create it.

As risk is not an independent factor and so cannot be the source of
profit. Indeed other activities can involve far more risk and be
rewarded less. Needless to say, the most serious consequences of "risk"
are usually suffered by working people who can lose their jobs, health
and even lives all depending on how the risks of the wealthy turn out in
an uncertain world. As such, it is one thing to gamble your own income
on a risky decision but quite another when that decision can ruin the
lives of others. If quoting Keynes is not too out of place:
*"Speculators may do no harm as bubbles on a steady stream of
enterprise. But the position is serious when enterprise becomes the
bubble on a whirlpool of speculation. When the capital development of a
country becomes a by-product of the activities of a casino, the job is
likely to be ill-done."* [**The General Theory of Employment, Interest
and Money**, p. 159]

Appeals of risk to justify capitalism simply exposes that system as
little more than a massive casino. In order for such a system to be
fair, the participants must have approximately equal chances of winning.
However, with massive inequality the wealthy face little chance of
loosing. For example, if a millionaire and a pauper both repeatedly bet
a pound on the outcome of a coin toss, the millionaire will always win
as the pauper has so little reserve money that even a minor run of bad
luck will bankrupt him.

Ultimately, *"the capitalist investment game (as a whole and usually in
its various parts) is positive sum. In most years more money is made in
the financial markets than is lost. How is this possible? It is possible
only because those who engage in real productive activity receive less
than that to which they would be entitled were they fully compensated
for what they produce. The reward, allegedly for risk, derives from this
discrepancy."* [David Schweickart, **Op. Cit.**, p. 38] In other words,
people would not risk their money unless they could make a profit and
the willingness to risk is dependent on current and expected profit
levels and so cannot explain them. To focus on risk simply obscures the
influence that property has upon the ability to enter a given industry
(i.e. to take a risk in the first place) and so distracts attention away
from the essential aspects of how profits are actually generated (i.e.
away from production and its hierarchical organisation under
capitalism).

So risk does not explain how surplus value is generated nor is its
origin. Moreover, as the risk people face and the return they get is
dependent on the wealth they have, it cannot be used to justify this
distribution. Quite the opposite, as return and risk are usually
inversely related. If risk was the source of surplus value or justified
it, the riskiest investment and poorest investor would receive the
highest returns and this is not the case. In summary, the "risk" defence
of capitalism does not convince.
