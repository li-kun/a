Section J - What do anarchists do?
==================================

This section discusses what anarchists get up to. There is little point
thinking about the world unless you also want to change it for the
better. And by trying to change it, you change yourself and others,
making radical change more of a possibility. Therefore anarchists give
their whole-hearted support to attempts by ordinary people to improve
their lives by their own actions. We urge *"**emancipation through
practical action**"* recognising that the *"collective experience"*
gained in *"the collective struggle of the workers against the bosses"*
will transform how they see the world and the world itself. [Bakunin,
**The Basic Bakunin**, p. 103] Ultimately, *"[t]he true man does not lie
in the future, an object of longing, but lies, existent and real, in the
present."* [Stirner, **The Ego and Its Own**, p. 327]

Anarchism is more than just a critique of statism and capitalism or a
vision of a freer, better way of life. It is first and foremost a
movement, the movement of working class people attempting to change the
world. Therefore the kind of activity we discuss in this section of the
FAQ forms the bridge between capitalism and anarchy. By self-activity
and direct action, people can change both themselves and their
surroundings. They develop within themselves the mental, ethical and
spiritual qualities which can make an anarchist society a viable option.
As Noam Chomsky argues:

> *"Only through their own struggle for liberation will ordinary people
> come to comprehend their true nature, suppressed and distorted within
> institutional structures designed to assure obedience and
> subordination. Only in this way will people develop more humane
> ethical standards, 'a new sense of right', 'the consciousness of their
> strength and their importance as a social factor in the life of their
> time' and their capacity to realise the strivings of their 'inmost
> nature.' Such direct engagement in the work of social reconstruction
> is a prerequisite for coming to perceive this 'inmost nature' and is
> the indispensable foundations upon which it can flourish"*
> [*"preface"*, Rudolf Rocker, **Anarcho-Syndicalism**, p. iii]

In other words, anarchism is not primarily a vision of a better future,
but the actual social movement which is fighting within the current
unjust and unfree society for that better future and to improve things
in the here and now. Without standing up for yourself and what you
believe is right, nothing will change. Thus anarchy can be found
*"wherever free thought breaks loose from the chains of dogma; wherever
the spirit of inquiry rejects the old formulas, wherver the human will
asserts itself through independent actions; wherever honest people,
rebelling against all enforced discipline, join freely together in order
to educate themselves, and to reclaim, without any master, their share
of life, and the complete satisfaction of their needs."* [ElisÃ©e Reclus,
quoted by John P. Clark and Camille Martin (ed.), **Anarchy, Geography,
Modernity**, p. 62]

For anarchists, the future is **already appearing in the present** and
is expressed by the creativity of working class self-activity. Anarchy
is not some-day-to-be-achieved utopia, it is a living reality whose
growth only needs to be freed from constraint. As such anarchist
activity is about discovering and aiding emerging trends of mutual aid
which work against capitalist domination, so the Anarchist *"studies
society and tries to discover its **tendencies**, past and present, its
growing needs, intellectual and economic, and in his [or her] ideal he
merely points out in which direction evolution goes."* [Peter Kropotkin,
**Anarchism**, p. 47] Indeed, as we discussed in [section
I.2.3](secI2.html#seci23), the future structures of a free society are
created in the struggles against oppression today.

The kinds of activity outlined in this section are a general overview of
anarchist work. It is by no means exclusive -- we are sure to have left
something out. However, the key aspect of **real** anarchist activity is
***direct action*** - self-activity, self-help, self-liberation and
solidarity (*"We wish,"* as French syndicalist Fernand Pelloutier wrote,
*"that the emancipation of the people might be the work of the people
themselves."* [quoted by Jeremy Jennings, **Syndicalism in France**, p.
18]). Such activity may be done by individuals (for example, propaganda
work), but usually anarchists emphasise collective activity. This is
because most of our problems are of a social nature, meaning that their
solutions can only be worked on collectively. Individual solutions to
social problems are doomed to failure, at best slowing down what they
are opposed to (most obviously, ethical consumerism as discussed in
[section E.5](secE5.html)). In addition, collective action gets us used
to working together, promoting the experience of self-management and
building organisations that will allow us to actively manage our own
affairs. Also, and we would like to emphasise this, it can be **fun** to
get together with other people and work with them, it can be fulfilling
and empowering.

Anarchists do not ask those in power to give up that power. No, we
promote forms of activity and organisation by which all the oppressed
can liberate themselves by their own hands. In other words, we do not
think that those in power will altruistically renounce that power or
their privileges. Instead, the oppressed must take the power **back**
into their own hands by their own actions. We must free ourselves, no
one else can do it for use.

Here we will discuss anarchist ideas on struggle, what anarchists
actually (and, almost as importantly, do not) do in the here and now and
the sort of alternatives anarchists try to build within statism and
capitalism in order to destroy them. As well as a struggle against
oppression, anarchist activity is also struggle for freedom. As well as
fighting against material poverty, anarchists combat spiritual poverty.
By resisting hierarchy we emphasis the importance of **living** and of
**life as art.** By proclaiming ***"Neither Master nor Slave"*** we urge
an ethical transformation, a transformation that will help create the
possibility of a truly free society. This point was stressed by Emma
Goldman after she saw the defeat of the Russian Revolution by a
combination of Leninist politics and capitalist armed intervention:

> *"revolution is in vain unless inspired by its ultimate ideal.
> Revolutionary methods must be in tune with revolutionary aims . . . In
> short, the ethical values which the revolution is to establish must be
> initiated with the revolutionary activities . . . The latter can only
> serve as a real and dependable bridge to the better life if built of
> the same material as the life to be achieved."* [**Red Emma Speaks**,
> p. 404]

In other words, anarchist activity is more than creating libertarian
alternatives and resisting hierarchy, it is about building the new world
in the shell of the old not only with regards to organisations and
self-activity, but also within the individual. It is about transforming
yourself while transforming the world (both processes obviously
interacting and supporting each other) for while *"we associate
ourselves with others in working for . . . social revolution, which for
us means the destruction of all monopoly and all government, and the
direct seizure by the workers of the means of production"* we do not
forget that *"the first aim of Anarchism is to assert and make good the
dignity of the individual human being."* [Charlotte Wilson, **Anarchist
Essays**, p. 43 and p. 51]

By direct action, self-management and self-activity we can make the
words first heard in Paris, 1968 a living reality: **"All power to the
imagination!"** Words, we are sure, previous generations of anarchists
would have whole-heartedly agreed with. There is a power in humans, a
creative power, a power to alter *what is* into *what should be*.
Anarchists try to create alternatives that will allow that power to be
expressed, the power of imagination.

Such a social movement will change how we act as individuals, with
anarchists seeking to apply our principles in our daily lives as much as
our daily struggles. This means that libertarians must change how we
relate to our comrades and fellow workers by applying our egalitarian
ideals everywhere. Part of the task of anarchists is to challenge social
hierarchies everywhere, including in the home. As Durruti put it:

> *"When will you stop thinking like the bourgeoisie, that women are
> men's servants? It's enough that society is divided into classes.
> We're not going to make even more classes by creating differences
> between men and women in our own homes!"* [quoted by Abel Paz,
> **Durruti in the Spanish Revolution**, p. 341]

So we have a interactive process of struggle and transformation of both
society and the individuals within it. In the sections that follow we
will discuss the forms of self-activity and self-organisation which
anarchists think will stimulate and develop the imagination of those
oppressed by hierarchy, build anarchy in action and help create a free
society.
