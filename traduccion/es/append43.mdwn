What caused the degeneration of the Russian Revolution?
=======================================================

As is well known, the Russian Revolution failed. Rather than produce
socialism, the Bolshevik revolution gave birth to an autocratic party
dictatorship residing over a state capitalist economy. In turn, this
regime gave rise to the horrors of Stalin's system. While Stalinism was
denounced by all genuine socialists, a massive debate has existed within
the Marxist movement over when, exactly, the Russian Revolution failed
and why it did. Some argue around 1924, others say around 1928, some
(libertarian Marxists) argue from the Bolshevik seizure of power. The
reasons for the failure tend to be more readily agreed upon: isolation,
the economic and social costs of civil war, the *"backward"* nature of
Russian society and economy are usually listed as the key factors.
Moreover, what the Stalinist regime was is also discussed heatedly in
such circles. Some (orthodox Trotskyists) claiming it was a
*"degenerated workers state,"* others (such as the neo-Trotskyist UK
SWP) that it was *"state capitalist."*

For anarchists, however, the failure of Bolshevism did not come as a
surprise. In fact, just as with the reformist fate of the Social
Democrats, the failure of the Russian Revolution provided empirical
evidence for Bakunin's critique of Marx. As Emma Goldman recounts in her
memoirs

> *"Professor Harold Laski . . . expressed the opinion that I ought to
> take some comfort in the vindication anarchism had received by the
> Bolsheviki. I agreed, adding that not only their regime, but their
> stepbrothers as well, the Socialists in power in other countries, had
> demonstrated the failure of the Marxian State better than any
> anarchist argument. Living proof was always more convincing than
> theory. Naturally I did not regret the Socialist failure but I could
> not rejoice in it in the face of the Russian tragedy."* [**Living My
> Life**, vol. 2, p. 969]

Given that Leninists claim that the Russian revolution was a success (at
least initially) and so proves the validity of their ideology,
anarchists have a special duty to analysis and understand what went
wrong. Simply put, if the Russian Revolution was a "success," Leninism
does not need "failures"!

This section of the FAQ will discuss these explanations for the failure
of Bolshevism. Simply put, anarchists are not convinced by Leninist
explanations on why Bolshevism created a new class system, not
socialism.

This subject is very important. Unless we learn the lessons of history
we will be doomed to repeat them. Given the fact that many people who
become interested in socialist ideas will come across the remnants of
Leninist parties it is important that anarchists explains clearly and
convincingly why the Russian Revolution failed and the role of Bolshevik
ideology in that process. We need to account why a popular revolution
became in a few short years a state capitalist party dictatorship. As
Noam Chomsky put it:

> *"In the stages leading up to the Bolshevik coup in October 1917,
> there **were** incipient socialist institutions developing in Russia
> -- workers' councils, collectives, things like that. And they survived
> to an extent once the Bolsheviks took over -- but not for very long;
> Lenin and Trotsky pretty much eliminated them as they consolidated
> their power. I mean, you can argue about the **justification** for

>
> "Now, people who want to justify it say, 'The Bolsheviks had to do it'

> conscious and understandable." [**Understanding Power**, p. 226]

As we discussed in the appendix on ["What happened during the Russian
Revolution?"](append41.html), Chomsky's feelings are more than supported
by the historical record. The elimination of meaningful working class
freedom and self-management started from the start and was firmly in
place before the start of the civil war at the end of May, 1918. The
civil war simply accelerated processes which had already started,
strengthened policies that had already been applied. And it could be
argued that rather than impose alien policies onto Bolshevism, the civil
war simply brought the hidden (and not-so-hidden) state capitalist and
authoritarian politics of Marxism and Leninism to the fore.

Which is why analysing the failure of the revolution is important. If
the various arguments presented by Leninists on why Bolshevism failed
(and, consequently, Stalinism developed) can be refuted, then we are
left with the key issues of revolutionary politics -- whether Bolshevik
politics had a decisive negative impact on the development of the
Russian Revolution and, if so, there is an alternative to those
politics. As regards the first issue, as we discussed in the appendix on
["How did Bolshevik ideology contribute to the failure of the
Revolution?"](append44.html), anarchists argue that this was the case.
Bolshevik ideology itself played a key role in the degeneration of the
revolution. And as regards the second one, anarchists can point to the
example of the Makhnovists, which proves that alternative policies were
possible and could be applied with radically different outcomes (see the
appendix on ["Why does the Makhnovist movement show there is an
alternative to Bolshevism?"](append46.html) for more on the Makhnovist
movement).

This means that anarchists stress the interplay between the "objective
factors" and the subjective one (i.e. party ideology). Faced with
difficult circumstances, people and parties react in different ways. If
they did not then it would imply what they thought has no impact at all
on their actions. It also means that the politics of the Bolsheviks
played no role in their decisions. As we discussed in the appendix on
["What happened during the Russian Revolution?"](append41.html), this
position simply cannot be maintained. Leninist ideology itself played a
key role in the rise of Stalinism. A conclusion Leninists reject. They,
of course, try to distance themselves from Stalinism, correctly arguing
that it was a brutal and undemocratic system. The problem is that it was
Lenin and Trotsky rather then Stalin who first shot strikers, banned
left papers, radical organisations and party factions, sent workers and
revolutionaries to the gulags, advocated and introduced one-man
management and piece-work in the workplace, eliminated democracy in the
military and shut down soviets elected with the "wrong" (i.e.
non-Bolshevik) delegates.

Many Leninists know nothing of these facts. Their parties simply do not
tell them the whole story of when Lenin and Trotsky were in power.
Others do know and attempt to justify these actions. When anarchists
discuss why the Russian Revolution failed, these Leninists have
basically one reply. They argue that anarchists never seem to consider
the objective forces at play during the Russian revolution, namely the
civil war, the legacy of World War One, the international armies of
counter-revolution and economic disruption. These *"objective factors"*
meant that the revolution was, basically, suffocated and where the
overriding contribution to the rise of militarism and the crushing of
democracy within the soviets.

For anarchists such *"objective factors"* do not (and must not) explain
why the Russian Revolution failed. This is because, as we argue in the
following sections, almost all revolutions will face the same, or
similar, problems. Indeed, in sections [1](append43.html#app1) and
[2](append43.html#app2) both anarchists like Kropotkin and Marxists like
Lenin argued that this was the case. As we discussed in [section
H.2.1](secH2.html#sech21), Leninists like to claim that they are
*"realistic"* (unlike the *"utopian"* anarchists) and recognise civil
war is inevitable in a revolution. As [section 3](append43.html#app3)
indicates, any defence of Bolshevism based on blaming the impact of the
civil war is both factually and logically flawed. As far as economic
disruption goes, as we discuss in [section 4](append43.html#app4) this
explanation of Bolshevik authoritarianism is unconvincing as **every**
revolution will face this problem. Then [section 5](append43.html#app5)
analyses the common Leninist argument that the revolution failed because
the Russian working class became *"atomised"* or *"declassed."* As that
section indicates, the Russian working class was more than capable of
collective action throughout the 1918 to 1921 period (and beyond). The
problem was that it was directed **against** the Bolshevik party.
Finally, [section 6](append43.html#app6) indicates whether the Bolshevik
leaders explained their actions in terms of the "objective factors" they
faced.

It should be stressed that we are discussing this factors individually
simply because it is easier to do so. It reality, it is less hard to do
so. For example, civil war will, undoubtedly, mean economic disruption.
Economic disruption will mean unemployment and that will affect the
working class via unemployment and less goods available (for example).
So just because we separate the specific issues for discussion purposes,
it should not be taken to imply that we are not aware of their combined
impact on the Russian Revolution.

Of course there is the slight possibility that the failure of Bolshevism
can be explained **purely** in these terms. Perhaps a future revolution
will be less destructive, less isolated, less resisted than the Russian
(although, as we noted in the [section 2](append43.html#app2), leading
Bolsheviks like Lenin, Trotsky and Bukharin doubted this). That **is** a
possibility. However, should we embrace an ideology whose basic,
underlying, argument is based on the hope that fate will be kinder to
them this time? As Lenin argued against the Russian left-communists in
early 1918:

> *"Yes, we shall see the world revolution, but for the time being it is
> a very good fairy-tale . . . But I ask, is it proper for a serious
> revolutionary to believe in fairy-tales? . . . [I]f you tell the
> people that civil war will break out in German and also guarantee that
> instead of a clash with imperialism we shall have a field revolution
> on a world-wide scale, the people will say you are deceiving them. In
> doing this you will be overcoming the difficulties with which history
> has confronted us only in your minds, by your wishes . . . You are
> staking everything on this card! If the revolution breaks out,
> everything is saved . . . But if it does not turn out as we desire, if
> it does not achieve victory tomorrow -- what then? Then the masses
> will say to you, you acted like gamblers -- you staked everything on a
> fortunate turn of events that did not take place . . ."* [**Collected
> Works**, vol. 27, p. 102]

Anarchists have always recognised that a revolution would face problems
and difficult "objective factors" and has developed our ideas
accordingly. We argue that to blame "objective factors" on the failure
of the Russian Revolution simply shows that believing in fairy-tales is
sadly far too common on the "serious" Leninist "revolutionary" left. And
as we discuss in the appendix on ["How did Bolshevik ideology contribute
to the failure of the Revolution?"](append44.html), the impact of
Bolshevik ideology on the failure of the revolution was important and
decisive. Even **if** the next revolution is less destructive, it cannot
be argued that socialism will be the result if Bolshevik ideology is
reapplied. And as Cornelius Castoriadis argues, *"this 'response' [of
explaining the failure of the Russian Revolution on "objective factors"]
teaches us nothing we could extend beyond the confines of the Russian
situation in 1920. The sole conclusion to be drawn from this kind of
'analysis' is that revolutionaries should ardently hope that future
revolutions break out in more advanced countries, that they should not
remain isolated, and that civil wars should not in the least be
devastating."* [**The Role of Bolshevik Ideology in the Birth of the
Bureaucracy**, p. 92] While this may be sufficient for the followers of
Bolshevism, it cannot be sufficient for anyone who wants to learn from
history, not to repeat it.

Ultimately, if difficult times back in 1918-21 justified suppressing
working class freedom and self-management, imprisoning and shooting
anarchists and other socialists, implementing and glorifying party
dictatorship, what might we expect in difficult times in the future?
Simply put, if your defence of the Bolsheviks rests simply on "difficult
circumstances" then it can only mean one thing, namely if "difficult
circumstances" occur again we can expect the same outcome.

One last point. We should stress that libertarians do not think any
future revolution will suffer as terrible conditions as that experienced
by the Russian one. However, it might and we need to base our politics
on the worse case possibility. That said, we argue that Bolshevik
policies made things worse -- by centralising economic and political
power, they automatically hindered the participation of working class
people in the revolution, smothering any creative self-activity under
the dead-weight of state officialdom. As a libertarian revolution would
be based on maximising working class self-activity (at all levels,
locally and upwards) we would argue that it would be better placed to
respond to even the terrible conditions facing the Russian Revolution.

That is not all. As we argue in the appendix on ["How did Bolshevik
ideology contribute to the failure of the Revolution?"](append44.html)
we are of the opinion that Bolshevism itself undermined the socialist
potential of the revolution, irrespective of the actual circumstances
involved (which, to some degree, will affect **any** revolution). For
example, the Bolshevik preference for centralisation and nationalisation
would negatively affect a revolution conducted in even the best
circumstances, as would the seizure of state power rather than its
destruction. As is clear from the appendix on ["How did Bolshevik
ideology contribute to the failure of the Revolution?"](append44.html),
only the elimination of what makes Bolshevism Bolshevik would ensure
that a revolution would be truly libertarian. So anarchists stress that
rather than be forced upon them by *"objective factors"* many of these
policies were, in fact, in line with pre-civil war Bolshevik ideas. The
Bolshevik vision of socialism, in other words, ensured that they
smothered the (libertarian) socialist tendencies and institutions that
existed at the time. As Chomsky summarises, *"Lenin and Trotsky, shortly
after seizing state power in 1917, moved to dismantle organs of popular
control, including factory committees and Soviets, thus proceeding to
deter and overcome socialist tendencies."* [**Deterring Democracy**, p.
361] That they **thought** their system of state capitalism was a form
of "socialism" is irrelevant -- they systematically combated (real)
socialist tendencies in favour of state capitalist ones and did so
knowingly and deliberately (see sections [H.3.1](secH3.html#sech31) and
[H.3.13](secH3.html#sech313) on the differences between real socialism
and Marxism in its Bolshevik mode and, of course, ["What happened during
the Russian Revolution?"](append41.html) on Bolshevik practice itself).

So it is important to stress that even **if** the Russian Revolution had
occurred in better circumstances, it is unlikely that Bolshevism would
have resulted in socialism rather than state capitalism. Certain
Bolshevik principles ensure that any revolution lead by a vanguard party
would not have succeeded. This can be seen from the experience of
Bolshevism immediately after it seized power, before the start of the
civil war and major economic collapse. In the circumstances of
post-world war I Russia, these principles were attenuated but their
application in even the best of situations would have undermined
socialist tendencies in the revolution. Simply put, a statist revolution
will have statist, not libertarian, ends.

The focusing on "objective factors" (particularly the civil war) has
become the traditional excuse for people with a romantic attachment to
Leninism but who are unwilling to make a stand over what the Bolsheviks
actually did in power. This excuse is not viable if you seek to build a
revolutionary movement today: you need to choose between the real path
of Lenin and the real, anarchist, alternative. As Lenin constantly
stressed, a revolution will be difficult -- fooling ourselves about what
will happen now just undermines our chances of success in the future and
ensure that history will repeat itself.

Essentially, the "objective factors" argument is not a defence of
Leninism, but rather one that seeks to evade having to make such a
defence. This is very typical of Leninist parties today. Revolutionary
politics would be much better served by confronting this history and the
politics behind it head on. Perhaps, if Leninists did do this, they
would probably remain Leninists, but at least then their party members
and those who read their publications would have an understanding of
what this meant. And they would have to dump Lenin's **State and
Revolution** into the same place Lenin himself did when in power -- into
the rubbish bin -- and admit that democracy and Bolshevik revolution do
not go together.

It is precisely these rationalisations for Bolshevism based on
"objective factors" which this section of the FAQ discusses and refutes.
However, it is important to stress that it was **not** a case of the
Bolshevik regime wanting to introduce communism but, being isolated,
ended up imposing state capitalism instead. Indeed, the idea that
"objective factors" caused the degeneration of the revolution is only
valid if and only if the Bolsheviks were implementing socialist policies
during the period immediately after the October revolution. That was not
the case. Rather than objective factors undermining socialist policies,
the facts of the matter are that the Bolsheviks pursued a statist and
(state) capitalist policy from the **start.** As we discuss in the
appendix on ["How did Bolshevik ideology contribute to the failure of
the Revolution?"](append44.html) the likes of Lenin explicitly argued
for these policies as essential for building socialism (or, at best, the
preconditions of socialism) in Russia and Bolshevik practice flowed from
these comments. As we discuss in more detail in the appendix on ["What
happened during the Russian Revolution?"](append41.html), the Bolsheviks
happily introduced authoritarian and state capitalist policies **from
the start.** Many of the policies denounced as "Stalinist" by Leninists
were being advocated and implemented by Lenin in the spring of 1918,
i.e. before the start of the civil war and massive economic chaos. In
other words, the usual excuses for Bolshevik tyranny do not hold much
water, both factually and logically -- as this section of the FAQ seeks
to show.

And, ironically, the framework which Leninists use in this discussion
shows the importance of Bolshevik ideology and the key role it played in
the outcome of the revolution. After all, pro-Bolsheviks argue that the
*"objective factors"* forced the **Bolsheviks** to act as they did.
However, the proletariat is meant to be the *"ruling class"* in the
*"dictatorship of the proletariat."* As such, to argue that the
Bolsheviks were forced to act as they did due to circumstances means to
implicitly acknowledge that the party held power in Russia, **not** the
working class. That a ruling party could become a party dictatorship is
not that unsurprising. Nor that **its** vision of what "socialism" was
would be given preference over the desires of the working class in whose
name it ruled.

Ultimately, the discussion on why the Bolshevik party failed shows the
validity of Bakunin's critique of Marxism. As he put it:

> *"Nor can we comprehend talk of freedom of the proletariat or true
> deliverance of the masses within the State and by the State. State
> signifies domination, and all domination implies subjection of the
> masses, and as a result, their exploitation to the advantage of some
> governing minority.*
>
> "Not even as revolutionary transition will we countenance national
> Conventions, nor Constituent Assemblies, nor provisional governments,
> nor so called revolutionary dictatorships: because we are persuaded
> that revolution is sincere, honest and real only among the masses and
> that, whenever it is concentrated in the hands of a few governing
> individuals, it inevitably and immediately turns into reaction." [**No
> Gods, No Masters**, vol. 1, p. 160]

The degeneration of the Russian Revolution can be traced from when the
Bolsheviks seized power **on behalf of** the Russian working class and
peasantry. The state implies the delegation of power and initiative into
the hands of a few leaders who form the "revolutionary government." Yet
the power of any revolution, as Bakunin recognised, derives from the
decentralisation of power, from the active participation of the masses
in the collective social movement and the direct action it generates. As
soon as this power passes out of the hands of the working class, the
revolution is doomed: the counter-revolution has begun and it matters
little that it is draped in a red flag. Hence anarchist opposition to
the state.

Sadly, many socialists have failed to recognise this. Hopefully this
section of our FAQ will show that the standard explanations of the
failure of the Russian revolution are, at their base, superficial and
will only ensure that history will repeat itself.

1 Do anarchists ignore the objective factors facing the Russian revolution?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is often asserted by Leninists that anarchists simply ignore the
"objective factors" facing the Bolsheviks when we discuss the
degeneration of the Russian Revolution. Thus, according to this
argument, anarchists present a basically idealistic analysis of the
failure of Bolshevism, one not rooted in the material conditions facing
(civil war, economic chaos, etc.) facing Lenin and Trotsky.

According to one Trotskyist, anarchists *"do not make the slightest
attempt at a serious analysis of the situation"* and so *"other
considerations, of a different, 'theoretical' nature, are to be found in
their works."* Thus:

> *"Bureaucratic conceptions beget bureaucracy just as opium begets
> sleep by virtue of its sleep-inducing properties. Trotsky was wrong to
> explain the proliferation and rise of the bureaucracy on the basis of
> the country's backwardness, low cultural level, and the isolation of
> the revolution. No, what have rise to a social phenomenon like
> Stalinism was a conception or idea . . . it is ideas, or deviations
> from them, that determine the character of revolutions. The most
> simplistic kind of philosophical idealism has laid low historical
> materialism."* [Pierre Frank, *"Introduction,"* Lenin and Trotsky,
> **Kronstadt**, pp. 22-3]

Many other Trotskyists take a similar position (although most would
include the impact of the Civil War on the rise of Bolshevik
authoritarianism and the bureaucracy). Duncan Hallas, for example,
argues that the account of the Bolshevik counter-revolution given in the
Cohn-Bendit brothers' **Obsolete Communism** is marked by a *"complete
omission of any consideration of the circumstances in which they
[Bolshevik decisions] took place. The ravages of war and civil war, the
ruin of Russian industry, the actual disintegration of the Russian
working class: all of this, apparently, has no bearing on the outcome."*
[**Towards a Revolutionary Socialist Party**, p. 41] Thus the *"degree
to which workers can 'make their own history' depends on the weight of
objective factors bearing down on them . . . To decide in any given
circumstance the weight of the subjective and objective factors demands
a concrete analysis of the balance of forces."* The conditions in Russia
meant that the *"subjective factor"* of Bolshevik ideology *"was reduced
to a choice between capitulation to the Whites or defending the
revolution with whatever means were at hands. Within these limits
Bolshevik policy was decisive. But it could not wish away the limits and
start with a clean sheet. It is a tribute to the power of the
Bolsheviks' politics and organisation that they took the measures
necessary and withstood the siege for so long."* [John Rees, *"In
Defence of October,"* pp. 3-82, **International Socialism**, no. 52, p.
30]

So, it is argued, by ignoring the problems facing the Bolsheviks and
concentrating on their **ideas,** anarchists fail to understand **why**
the Bolsheviks acted as they did. Unsurprisingly anarchists are not
impressed with this argument. This is for a simple reason. According to
anarchist theory the *"objective factors"* facing the Bolsheviks are to
be expected in **any** revolution. Indeed, the likes of Bakunin and
Kropotkin predicted that a revolution would face the very *"objective
factors"* which Leninists use to justify and rationalise Bolshevik
actions (see [next section](append43.html#app2)). As such, to claim that
anarchists ignore the *"objective factors"* facing the Bolsheviks during
the Russian Revolution is simply a joke. How can anarchists be
considered to ignore what they consider to be the inevitable results of
a revolution? Moreover, these Bolshevik assertions ignore the fact that
the anarchists who wrote extensively about their experiences in Russia
never failed to note that difficult objective factors facing it.
Alexander Berkman in **The Bolshevik Myth** paints a clear picture of
the problems facing the revolution, as does Emma Goldman in her **My
Disillusionment in Russia**. This is not to mention anarchists like
Voline, Arshinov and Maximoff who took part in the Revolution,
experiencing the *"objective factors"* first hand (and in the case of
Voline and Arshinov, participating in the Makhnovist movement which,
facing the same factors, managed **not** to act as the Bolsheviks did).

However, as the claim that anarchists ignore the *"objective
circumstances"* facing the Bolsheviks is relatively common, it is
important to refute it once and for all. This means that while have we
discussed this issue in association with Leninist justifications for
repressing the Kronstadt revolt (see [section 12](append42.html#app12)
of the appendix ["What was the Kronstadt Rebellion?"](append42.html)),
it is worthwhile repeating them here. We are sorry for the duplication.

Anarchists take it for granted that, to quote Bakunin, revolutions *"are
not child's play"* and that they mean *"war, and that implies the
destruction of men and things."* The *"Social Revolution must put an end
to the old system of organisation based upon violence, giving full
liberty to the masses, groups, communes, and associations, and likewise
to individuals themselves, and destroying once and for all the historic
cause of all violences, the power and existence of the State."* This
meant a revolution would be *"spontaneous, chaotic, and ruthless, always
presupposes a vast destruction of property."* [**The Political
Philosophy of Bakunin**, p. 372, p. 373, p. 380] In other words:

> *"The way of the anarchist social revolution, which will come from the
> people themselves, is an elemental force sweeping away all obstacles.
> Later, from the depths of the popular soul, there will spontaneously
> emerge the new creative forms of life."* [**Bakunin on Anarchism**, p.
> 325]

He took it for granted that counter-revolution would exist, arguing that
it was necessary to *"constitute the federation of insurgent
associations, communes and provinces . . . to organise a revolutionary
force capable of defeating reaction"* and *"for the purpose of
self-defence."* [**Selected Writings**, p. 171]

It would, of course, be strange if this necessity for defence and
reconstruction would have little impact on the economic conditions in
the revolutionised society. The expropriation of the means of production
and the land by a free federation of workers' associations would have an
impact on the economy. Kropotkin built upon Bakunin's arguments,
stressing that a **social** revolution would, by necessity, involve
major difficulties and harsh objective circumstances. It is worth
quoting one of his many discussions of this at length:

> *"Suppose we have entered a revolutionary period, with or without
> civil war -- it does not matter, -- a period when old institutions are

As noted in [section 12](append42.html#app12) of the appendix on ["What
was the Kronstadt Uprising?"](append42.html), the perspective was at the
core of Kropotkin's politics. His classic work **Conquest of Bread** was
based on this clear understanding of the nature of a social revolution
and the objective problems it will face. As he put it, while a
*"political revolution can be accomplished without shaking the
foundations of industry"* a revolution *"where the people lay hands upon
property will inevitably paralyse exchange and production . . . This
point cannot be too much insisted upon; the reorganisation of industry
on a new basis . . . cannot be accomplished in a few days."* Indeed, he
considered it essential to *"show how tremendous this problem is."*
[**The Conquest of Bread**, pp. 72-3]

Therefore, *"[o]ne of the great difficulties in every Revolution is the
feeding of the large towns."* This was because the *"large towns of
modern times are centres of various industries that are developed
chiefly for the sake of the rich or for the export trade"* and these
*"two branches fail whenever any crisis occurs, and the question then
arises of how these great urban agglomerations are to be fed."* This
crisis, rather than making revolution impossible, spurred the creation
of what Kropotkin terms *"the communist movement"* in which *"the
Parisian proletariat had already formed a conception of its class
interests and had found men to express them well."* [Kropotkin, **The
Great French Revolution**, vol. II, p. 457 and p. 504]

As for self-defence, he reproached the authors of classic syndicalist
utopia **How we shall bring about the Revolution** for *"considerably
attenuat[ing] the resistance that the Social Revolution will probably
meet with on its way."* He stressed that the *"check of the attempt at
Revolution in Russia has shown us all the danger that may follow from an
illusion of this kind."* [*"preface,"* Emile Pataud and Emile Pouget,
**How we shall bring about the Revolution**, p. xxxvi]

It must, therefore, be stressed that the very *"objective factors"*
supporters of Bolshevism use to justify the actions of Lenin and Trotsky
were predicted correctly by anarchists decades before hand. Indeed,
rather than ignore them anarchists like Kropotkin based their political
and social ideas on these difficulties. As such, it seems ironic for
Leninists to attack anarchists for allegedly ignoring these factors. It
is even more ironic as these very same Leninists are meant to know that
**any** revolution will involve these exact same *"objective factors,"*
something that Lenin and other leading Bolsheviks acknowledged (see
[next section](append43.html#app2)).

Therefore, as noted, when anarchists like Emma Goldman and Alexander
Berkman arrived in Russia they were aware of the problems it, like any
revolution, would face. In the words of Berkman, *"what I saw and
learned as in such crying contrast with my hopes and expectations as to
shake the very foundation of my faith in the Bolsheviki. Not that I
expected to find Russia a proletarian Eldorado. By no means. I knew how
great the travail of a revolutionary period, how stupendous the
difficulties to be overcome. Russia was besieged on numerous fronts;
there was counter-revolution within and without; the blockade was
starving the country and denying even medical aid to sick women and
children. The people were exhausted by long war and civil strive;
industry was disorganised, the railroads broken down. I fully realised
the dire situation, with Russia shedding her blood on the alter of the
Revolution."* [**The Bolshevik Myth**, p. 329] Emma Goldman expressed
similar opinions. [**My Disillusionment in Russia**, pp. xlvii-xlix]

Unsurprisingly, therefore this extremely realistic perspective can be
found in their later works. Berkman, for example, stressed that *"when
the social revolution had become thoroughly organised and production is
functioning normally there will be enough for everybody. But in the
first stages of the revolution, during the process of re-construction,
we must take care to supply the people the best we can, and equally,
which means rationing."* This was because the *"first effect of the
revolution is reduced production."* This would be initially due to the
general strike which is its *"starting point."* However, *"[w]hen the
social revolution begins in any land, its foreign commerce stops: the
importation of raw materials and finished products is suspended. The
country may even be blockaded by the bourgeois governments."* In
addition, he thought it important not to suppress *"small scale
industries"* as they would be essential when *"a country in revolution
is attacked by foreign governments, when it is blockaded and deprived of
imports, when its large-scale industries threaten to break down or the
railways do break down."* [**ABC of Anarchism**, p. 67, p. 74 p. 78-9
and p. 79]

He, of course, considered it essential that to counteract isolation
workers must understand *"that their cause is international"* and that
*"the organisation of labour"* must develop *"beyond national
boundaries."* However, *"the probability is not to be discounted that
the revolution may break out in one country sooner than in another"* and
*"in such a case it would become imperative . . . not to wait for
possible aid from outside, but immediately to exert all her energies to
help herself supply the most essential needs of her people by her own
efforts."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 78]

Emma Goldman, likewise, noted that it was *"a tragic fact that all
revolutions have sprung from the loins of war. Instead of translating
the revolution into social gains the people have usually been forced to
defend themselves against warring parties."* *"It seems,"* she noted,
*"nothing great is born without pain and travail"* as well as *"the
imperative necessity of defending the Revolution."* However, in spite of
these inevitable difficulties she point to how the Spanish anarchists
*"have shown the first example in history **how Revolutions should be
made**"* by *"the constructive work"* of *"socialising of the land, the
organisation of the industries."* [**Vision on Fire**, p. 218, p. 222
and p. 55-56]

These opinions were, as can be seen, to be expected from revolutionary
anarchists schooled in the ideas of Bakunin and Kropotkin. Clearly,
then, far from ignoring the *"objective factors"* facing the Bolsheviks,
anarchists have based their politics around them. We have always argued
that a social revolution would face isolation, economic disruption and
civil war and have, for this reason, stressed the importance of mass
participation in order to overcome them. As such, when Leninists argue
that these inevitable *"objective factors"* caused the degeneration of
Bolshevism, anarchists simply reply that if it cannot handle the
inevitable then Bolshevism should be avoided. Just as we would avoid a
submarine which worked perfectly well until it was placed in the sea or
an umbrella which only kept you dry when it was not raining.

Moreover, what is to be made of this Leninist argument against
anarchism? In fact, given the logic of their claims we have to argument
we have to draw the conclusion that the Leninists seem to think a
revolution **could** happen **without** civil war and economic
disruption. As such it suggests that the Leninists have the *"utopian"*
politics in this matter. After all, if they argue that civil war is
inevitable then how can they blame the degeneration of the revolution on
it? Simply put, if Bolshevism cannot handle the inevitable it should be
avoided at all costs.

Ironically, as indicated in the [next section](append43.html#app2), we
can find ample arguments to refute the Trotskyist case against the
anarchist analysis in the works of leading Bolsheviks like Lenin,
Trotsky aand Bukharin. Indeed, their arguments provide a striking
confirmation of the anarchist position as they, like Kropotkin, stress
that difficult *"objective factors"* will face **every** revolution.
This means to use these factors to justify Bolshevik authoritarianism
simply results in proving that Bolshevism is simply non-viable or that a
liberatory social revolution is, in fact, impossible (and, as a
consequence, genuine socialism).

There are, of course, other reasons why the Leninist critique of the
anarchist position is false. The first is theoretical. Simply put, the
Leninist position is the crudest form of economic determinism. Ideas
**do** matter and, as Marx himself stressed, can play a key in how a
social process develops. As we discuss in the appendix on ["How did
Bolshevik ideology contribute to the failure of the
Revolution?"](append44.html), Marxist ideology played a key role in the
degeneration of the revolution and in laying the groundwork for the rise
of Stalinism.

Ultimately, any Leninist defence of Bolshevism based purely on stressing
the *"objective factor"* implies that Bolshevik ideology played **no
role** in the decisions made by the party leaders, that they simply
operated on autopilot from October 1917 onwards. Yet, at the same time,
they stress the importance of Leninist ideology in ensuring the
"victory" of the revolution. They seek to have it both ways. However, as
Samuel Farber puts it:

> *"determinism's characteristic and systemic failure is to understand
> that what the masses of people do and think politically is as much
> part of the process determining the outcome of history as are the
> objective obstacles that most definitely limit peoples' choices."*
> [**Before Stalinism**, p. 198]

This is equally applicable when discussing the heads of a highly
centralised state who have effectively expropriated political, economic
and social power from the working class and are ruling in their name.
Unsurprisingly, rather than just select policies at random the Bolshevik
leadership pursued consistently before, during and after the civil war
policies which reflected their ideology. Hence there was a preference in
policies which centralised power in the hands of a few (politically
**and** economically), that saw socialism as being defined by
nationalisation rather than self-management, that stressed that role and
power of the vanguard above that of the working class, that saw class
consciousness as being determined by how much a worker agreed with the
party leadership rather than whether it expressed the actual needs and
interests of the class as a whole.

Then there is the empirical evidence against the Trotskyist explanation.

As we indicate in [section 3](append43.html#app3), soviet democracy and
workers' power in the workplace was **not** undermined by the civil war.
Rather, the process had began before the civil war started and, equally
significantly, continued after its end in November 1920. Moreover, the
*"gains"* of October Trotskyists claim that Stalinism destroyed were, in
fact, long dead by 1921. Soviet democracy, working class freedom of
speech, association and assembly, workers' self-management or control in
the workplace, trade union freedom, the ability to strike, and a host of
other, elementary, working class rights had been eliminated long before
the end of the civil war (indeed, often before it started) and,
moreover, the Bolsheviks did not lament this. Rather, *"there is no
evidence indicating that Lenin or any mainstream Bolshevik leaders
lamented the loss of workers' control or of democracy in the soviets ,
or at least referred to these losses as a retreat, as Lenin declared
with the replacement of War Communism by NEP in 1921."* [Samuel Farber,
**Op. Cit.**, p. 44]

And then there is the example of the Makhnovist movement. Operating in
the same *"objective circumstances,"* facing the same *"objective
factors,"* the Makhnovists did **not** implement the same policies as
the Bolsheviks. As we discussed in the appendix on ["Why does the
Makhnovist movement show there is an alternative to
Bolshevism?"](append46.html), rather than undermine soviet, soldier and
workplace democracy and replace all with party dictatorship, the
Makhnovists applied these as fully as they could. Now, if *"objective
factors"* explain the actions of the Bolsheviks, then why did the
Makhnovists not pursue identical policies?

Simply put, the idea that Bolshevik policies did not impact on the
outcome of the revolution is a false assertion, as the Makhnovists show.
Beliefs are utopian if subjective ideas are not grounded in objective
reality. Anarchists hold that part of the subjective conditions required
before socialism can exist is the existence of free exchange of ideas
and working class democracy (i.e. self-management). To believe that
revolution is possible without freedom, to believe those in power can,
through their best and genuine intentions, impose socialism from above,
as the Bolsheviks did, is indeed utopian. As the Bolsheviks proved. The
Makhnovists shows that the received wisdom is that there was no
alternative open to the Bolsheviks is false.

So while it cannot be denied that objective factors influenced how
certain Bolshevik policies were shaped and applied, the inspiration of
those policies came from Bolshevik ideology. An acorn will grow and
develop depending on the climate and location it finds itself in, but
regardless of the *"objective factors"* it will grow into an oak tree.
Similarly with the Russian revolution. While the circumstances it faced
influenced its growth, Bolshevik ideology could not help but produce an
authoritarian regime with no relationship with **real** socialism.

In summary, anarchists do not ignore the objective factors facing the
Bolsheviks during the revolution. As indicated, we predicted the
problems they faced and developed our ideas to counter them. As the
example of the Makhnovists showed, our ideas were more than adequate for
the task. Unlike the Bolsheviks.

2 Can *"objective factors"* really explain the failure of Bolshevism?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

As noted in the [previous section](append43.html#app1) Leninists tend to
argue that anarchists downplay (at best) or ignore (at worse) the
*"objective factors"* facing the Bolsheviks during the Russian
Revolution. As noted in the same section, this argument is simple false.
For anarchists have long expected the *"objective factors"* usually used
to explain the degeneration of the revolution.

However, there is more to it than that. Leninists claim to be
revolutionaries. They claim to know that revolutions face problems, the
civil war is inevitable and so forth. It therefore strikes anarchists as
being somewhat hypocritical for Leninists to blame these very same
*"objective"* but allegedly inevitable factors for the failure of
Bolshevism in Russia.

Ironically enough, Lenin and Trotsky agree with these anarchist
arguments. Looking at Trotsky, he dismissed the CNT's leaderships'
arguments in favour of collaborating with the bourgeois state:

> *"The leaders of the Spanish Federation of Labour (CNT) . . . became,
> in the critical hour, bourgeois ministers. They explained their open
> betrayal of the theory of anarchism by the pressure of 'exceptional
> circumstances.' But did not the leaders of the German social democracy
> invoke, in their time, the same excuse? Naturally, civil war is not a
> peaceful and ordinary but an 'exceptional circumstance.' Every serious
> revolutionary organisation, however, prepares precisely for
> 'exceptional circumstances' . . . We have not the slightest intention
> of blaming the anarchists for not having liquidated the state with the
> mere stroke of a pen. A revolutionary party , even having seized power
> (of which the anarchist leaders were incapable in spite of the heroism
> of the anarchist workers), is still by no means the sovereign ruler of
> society. But all the more severely do we blame the anarchist theory,
> which seemed to be wholly suitable for times of peace, but which had
> to be dropped rapidly as soon as the 'exceptional circumstances' of
> the... revolution had begun. In the old days there were certain
> generals - and probably are now - who considered that the most harmful
> thing for an army was war. Little better are those revolutionaries who
> complain that revolution destroys their doctrine."* [**Stalinism and
> Bolshevism**]

Thus to argue that the *"exceptional circumstances"* caused by the civil
war are the only root cause of the degeneration of the Russian
Revolution is a damning indictment of Bolshevism. After all, Lenin did
not argue in **State and Revolution** that the application of soviet
democracy was dependent only in *"times of peace."* Rather, he stressed
that they were for the *"exceptional circumstance"* of revolution and
the civil war he considered its inevitable consequence. As such, we must
note that Trotsky's followers do not apply this critique to their own
politics, which are also a form of the "exceptional circumstances"
excuse. Given how quickly Bolshevik "principles" (as expressed in **The
State and Revolution**) were dropped, we can only assume that Bolshevik
ideas are also suitable purely for *"times of peace"* as well. As such,
we must note the irony of Leninist claims that *"objective
circumstances"* explains the failure of the Bolshevik revolution.

Saying that, we should not that Trotsky was not above using such
arguments himself (making later-day Trotskyists at least ideologically
consistent in their hypocrisy). In the same essay, for example, he
justifies the prohibition of other Soviet parties in terms of a "measure
of defence of the dictatorship in a backward and devastated country,
surrounded by enemies on all sides." In other words, an appeal to the
exceptional circumstances facing the Bolsheviks! Perhaps unsurprisingly,
his followers have tended to stress this (contradictory) aspect of his
argument rather than his comments that those *"who propose the
abstraction of Soviets to the party dictatorship should understand that
only thanks to the party dictatorship were the Soviets able to lift
themselves out of the mud of reformism and attain the state form of the
proletariat. The Bolshevik party achieved in the civil war the correct
combination of military art and Marxist politics."* [**Op. Cit.**]
Which, of course, suggests that the prohibition of other parties had
little impact on levels of soviet "democracy" allowed under the
Bolsheviks (see [section 6](append41.html#app6) of the appendix on
["What happened during the Russian Revolution?"](append41.html)for more
on this).

This dismissal of the *"exceptional circumstances"* argument did not
originate with Trotsky. Lenin repeatedly stressed that any revolution
would face civil war and economic disruption. In early January, 1918, he
was pointing to *"the incredibly complications of war and economic
ruin"* in Russia and noting that *"the fact that Soviet power has been
established . . . is why civil war has acquired predominance in Russia
at the present time."* [**Collected Works**, vol. 26, p. 453 and p. 459]

A few months later he states quite clearly that *"it will never be
possible to build socialism at a time when everything is running
smoothly and tranquilly; it will never be possible to realise socialism
without the landowners and capitalists putting up a furious
resistance."* He reiterated this point, acknowledging that the *"country
is poor, the country is poverty-stricken, and it is impossible just now
to satisfy all demands; that is why it is so difficult to build the new
edifice in the midst of disruption. But those who believe that socialism
can be built at a time of peace and tranquillity are profoundly mistake:
it will be everywhere built at a time of disruption, at a time of
famine. That is how it must be."* [**Op. Cit.**, vol. 27, p. 520 and p.
517]

As regards civil war, he noted that *"not one of the great revolutions
of history has take place"* without one and *"without which not a single
serious Marxist has conceived the transition from capitalism to
socialism."* Moreover, *"there can be no civil war -- the inevitable
condition and concomitant of socialist revolution -- without
disruption."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 496 and p. 497] He considered this
disruption as being applicable to advanced capitalist nations as well:

> *"In Germany, state capitalism prevails, and therefore the revolution
> in Germany will be a hundred times more devastating and ruinous than
> in a petty-bourgeois country -- there, too, there will be gigantic
> difficulties and tremendous chaos and imbalance."* [**Op. Cit.**, vol.
> 28, p. 298]

And from June, 1918:

> *"We must be perfectly clear in our minds about the new disasters that
> civil war brings for every country. The more cultured a country is the
> more serious will be these disasters. Let us picture to ourselves a
> country possessing machinery and railways in which civil war is
> raging., and this civil war cuts off communication between the various
> parts of the country. Picture to yourselves the condition of regions
> which for decades have been accustomed to living by the interchange of
> manufactured goods and you will understand that every civil war brings
> forth disasters."* [**Op. Cit.**, vol. 27, p. 463]

As we discuss in [section 4](append43.html#app4), the economic state of
Germany immediately after the end of the war suggests that Lenin had a
point. Simply put, the German economy was in a serious state of
devastation, a state equal to that of Russia during the equivalent
period of its revolution. If economic conditions made party dictatorship
inevitable in Bolshevik Russia (as pro-Leninists argue) it would mean
that soviet democracy and revolution cannot go together.

Lenin reiterated this point again and again. He argued that *"we see
famine not only in Russia, but in the most cultured, advanced countries,
like Germany . . . it is spread over a longer period than in Russia, but
it is famine nevertheless, still more severe and painful than here."* In
fact, *"today even the richest countries are experiencing unprecedented
food shortages and that the overwhelming majority of the working masses
are suffering incredible torture."* [**Op. Cit.**, vol. 27, p. 460 and
p. 461]

Lenin, unlike many of his latter day followers, did not consider these
grim objective conditions are making revolution impossible. Rather, for
him, there was *"no other way out of this war"* which is causing the
problems *"except revolution, except civil war . . . a war which always
accompanies not only great revolutions but every serious revolution in
history."* He continued by arguing that we *"must be perfectly clear in
our minds about the new disasters that civil war brings for every
country. The more cultured a country is the more serious will be these
disasters. Let us picture to ourselves a country possessing machinery
and railways in which civil war is raging, and this civil war cuts
communication between the various parts of the country. Picture to
yourselves the condition of regions which for decades have been
accustomed to living by interchange of manufactured goods and you will
understand that every civil war brings fresh disasters."* [**Op. Cit.**,
p. 463] The similarities to Kropotkin's arguments made three decades
previously are clear (see [section 1](append43.html#app1) for details).

Indeed, he mocked those who would argue that revolution could occur with
*"exceptional circumstances"*:

> *"A revolutionary would not 'agree' to a proletarian revolution only
> 'on the condition' that it proceeds easily and smoothly, that there
> is, from the outset, combined action on the part of proletarians of
> different countries, that there are guarantees against defeats, that
> the road of the revolution is broad, free and straight, that it will
> not be necessary during the march to victory to sustain the heaviest
> casualties, to 'bide one's time in a besieged fortress,' or to make
> one's way along extremely narrow, impassable, winding and dangerous
> mountain tracks. Such a person is no revolutionary."* [**Selected
> Works**, vol. 2, p. 709]

He then turned his fire on those who failed to recognise the problems
facing a revolution and instead simply blamed the Bolsheviks:

> *"The revolution engendered by the war cannot avoid the terrible
> difficulties and suffering bequeathed it by the prolonged, ruinous,
> reactionary slaughter of the nations. To blame us for the
> 'destruction' of industry, or for the 'terror', is either hypocrisy or
> dull-witted pedantry; it reveals an inability to understand the basic
> conditions of the fierce class struggle, raised to the highest degree
> of intensity, that is called revolution."* [**Op. Cit.**, pp. 709-10]

Thus industrial collapse and terrible difficulties would face any
revolution. It goes without saying that if it was *"hypocrisy"* to blame
Bolshevik politics for these problems, it would be the same to blame
these problems for Bolshevik politics. As Lenin noted, *"in
revolutionary epochs the class struggle has always, inevitably, and in
every country, assumed the form of **civil war,** and civil war is
inconceivable without the severest destruction, terror and the
restriction of formal democracy in the interests of this war."*
Moreover, *"[w]e know that fierce resistance to the socialist revolution
on the part of the bourgeoisie is inevitable in all countries, and that
this resistance will **grow** with the growth of the revolution."*
[**Op. Cit.**, p. 710 and p. 712] To blame the inevitable problems of a
revolution for the failings of Bolshevism suggests that Bolshevism is
simply not suitable for revolutionary situations.

At the 1920 Comintern Congress Lenin lambasted a German socialist who
argued against revolution because *"Germany was so weakened by the War"*
that if it had been *"blockaded again the misery of the German masses
would have been even more dreadful."* Dismissing this argument, Lenin
argued as follows:

> *"A revolution . . . can be made only if it does not worsen the
> workers' conditions 'too much.' Is it permissible, in a communist
> party, to speak in a tone like this, I ask? This is the language of
> counter-revolution. The standard of living in Russia is undoubtedly
> lower than in Germany, and when we established the dictatorship, this
> led to the workers beginning to go more hungry and to their conditions
> becoming even worse. The workers' victory cannot be achieved without
> sacrificing, without a temporary deterioration of their conditions. .
> . If the German workers now want to work for the revolution, they must
> make sacrifices and not be afraid to do so . . . The labour
> aristocracy, which is afraid of sacrifices, afraid of 'too great'
> impoverishment during the revolutionary struggle, cannot belong to the
> party. Otherwise the dictatorship is impossible, especially in western
> European countries."* [**Proceedings and Documents of the Second
> Congress 1920**, pp. 382-3]

In 1921 he repeated this, arguing that *"every revolution entails
enormous sacrifice on the part of the class making it. . . The
dictatorship of the proletariat in Russia has entailed for the ruling
class -- the proletariat -- sacrifices, want and privation unprecedented
in history, and the case will, in all probability, be the same in every
other country."* [**Collected Works**, vol. 32, p. 488] Thus Lenin is on
record as saying these "objective factors" will always be the
circumstances facing a socialist revolution. Indeed, in November 1922 he
stated that *"Soviet rule in Russia is celebrating its fifth
anniversary, It is now sounder than ever."* [**Op. Cit.**, vol. 33, p.
417]

All of which must be deeply embarrassing to Leninists. After all, here
is Lenin arguing that the factors Leninist's list as being responsible
for the degeneration of the Russian Revolution were inevitable side
effects of **any** revolution!

Nor was this perspective limited to Lenin. The inevitability of economic
collapse being associated with a revolution was not lost on Trotsky
either (see [section 12](append42.html#app12) of the appendix on ["What
was the Kronstadt Rebellion?"](append42.html)). Nikolai Bukharin even
wrote the (infamous) **The Economics of the Transition Period** to make
theoretical sense of (i.e. rationalise and justify) the party's changing
policies and their social consequences since 1918 in terms of the
inevitability of bad "objective factors" facing the revolution. While
some Leninists like to paint Bukharin's book (like most Bolshevik ideas
of the time) as *"making a virtue out of necessity,"* Bukharin (like the
rest of the Bolshevik leadership) did not. As one commentator notes,
Bukharin *"belive[d] that he was formulating universal laws of
proletarian revolution."* [Stephan F. Cohen, **In Praise of War
Communism: Bukharin's The Economics of the Transition Period**, p. 195]

Bukharin listed four *"real costs of revolution,"* namely *"the physical
destruction or deterioration of material and living elements of
production, the atomisation of these elements and of sectors of the
economy, and the need for unproductive consumption (civil war materials,
etc.). These costs were interrelated and followed sequentially.
Collectively they resulted in '**the curtailment of the process of
reproduction**' (and 'negative expanded reproduction') and Bukharin's
main conclusion: 'the production *"anarchy"* . . . , *"the revolutionary
disintegration of industry,"* is an historically inevitable stage which
no amount of lamentation will prevent.'"* This was part of a general
argument and his *"point was that great revolutions were always
accompanied by destructive civil wars . . . But he was more intent on
proving that a proletarian revolution resulted in an even greater
temporary fall in production than did its bourgeois counterpart."* To do
this he formulated the *"costs of revolution"* as *"a law of
revolution."* [**Op. Cit.**, pp. 195-6 and p. 195]

Cohen notes that while this *"may appear to have been an obvious point,
but it apparently came as something of a revelation to many Bolsheviks.
It directly opposed the prevailing Social Democratic assumption that the
transition to socialism would be relatively painless . . . Profound or
not, Bolsheviks generally came to accept the 'law' and to regard it as a
significant discovery by Bukharin."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 196] To quote
Bukharin:

> *"during the transition period the labour apparatus of society
> inevitably disintegrates, that reorganisation presupposes
> disorganisation, and that there the temporary collapse of productive
> forces is a law inherent to revolution."* [quoted by Cohen, **Op.
> Cit.**, p. 196]

It would appear that this *"obvious point"* would **still** come *"as
something of a revelation to many Bolsheviks"* today! Significantly, of
course, Kropotkin had formulated this law decades previously! How the
Bolsheviks sought to cope with this inevitable law is what signifies the
difference between anarchism and Leninism. Simply put, Bukharin endorsed
the coercive measures of war communism as the means to go forward to
socialism. As Cohen summarises, *"force and coercion . . . were the
means by which equilibrium was to be forged out of disequilibrium."*
[**Op. Cit.**, p. 198] Given that Bukharin argued that a workers' state,
by definition, could not exploit the workers, he opened up the
possibility for rationalising all sorts of abuses as well as condoning
numerous evils because they were *"progressive."* Nor was Bukharin alone
in this, as Lenin and Trotsky came out with similar nonsense.

It should be noted that Lenin showed *"ecstatic praise for the most 'war
communist' sections"* of Bukharin's work. *"Almost every passage,"*
Cohen notes, *"on the role of the new state, statisation in general,
militarisation and mobilisation met with 'very good,' often in three
languages, . . . Most striking, Lenin's greatest enthusiasm was reserved
for the chapter on the role of coercion . . . at the end [of which] he
wrote, 'Now this chapter is superb!'"* [**Op. Cit.**, pp. 202-3] Compare
this to Kropotkin's comment that the *"revolutionary tribunal and the
guillotine could not make up for the lack of a constructive communist
theory."* [**The Great French Revolution**, vol. II, p. 519]

Ultimately, claims that "objective factors" caused the degeneration of
the revolution are mostly attempts to let the Bolsheviks of the hook for
Stalinism. This approach was started by Trotsky and continued to this
day. Anarchists, unsurprisingly, do not think much of these
explanations. For anarchists, the list of "objective factors" listed to
explain the degeneration of the revolution are simply a list of factors
**every** revolution would (and has) faced -- as Lenin, Bukharin and
Trotsky all admitted at the time!

So we have the strange paradox of Leninists dismissing and ignoring the
arguments of their ideological gurus. For Trotsky, just as for Lenin, it
was a truism that revolutionary politics had to handle *"objective"*
factors and *"exceptional circumstances."* And for both, they thought
they had during the Russian revolution. Yet for their followers, these
explain the failure of Bolshevism. Tony Cliff, one of Trotsky's less
orthodox followers, gives us a means of understanding this strange
paradox. Discussing the **Platform of the United Opposition** he notes
that it *"also suffered from the inheritance of the exceptional
conditions of the civil war, when the one-party system was transformed
from a necessity into a virtue."* [**Trotsky**, vol. 3, pp. 248-9]
Clearly, *"exceptional circumstances"* explain nothing and are simply an
excuse for bad politics while *"exceptional conditions"* explain
everything and defeat even the best politics!

As such, it seems to us extremely ironic that Leninists blame the civil
war for the failure of the revolution as they continually raise the
inevitability of civil war in a revolution to attack anarchism (see
[section H.2.1](secH2.html#sech21) for an example). Did Lenin not
explain in **State and Revolution** that his *"workers' state"* was
designed to defend the revolution and suppress capitalist resistance? If
it cannot do its proclaimed task then, clearly, it is a flawed theory.
Ultimately, if *"civil war"* and the other factors listed by Leninists
(but considered inevitable by Lenin) preclude the implementation of the
radical democracy Lenin argued for in 1917 as the means to suppress the
resistance of the capitalists then his followers should come clean and
say that that work has no bearing on their vision of revolution.
Therefore, given that the usual argument for the *"dictatorship of the
proletariat"* is that it is required to repress counter-revolution, it
seems somewhat ironic that the event it was said to be designed for
(i.e. revolution) should be responsible for its degeneration!

As such, anarchists tend to think these sorts of explanations of
Bolshevik dictatorship are incredulous. After all, as
**revolutionaries** the people who expound these *"explanations"* are
meant to know that civil war, imperialist invasion and blockade,
economic disruption, and a host of other *"extremely difficult
circumstances"* are part and parcel of a revolution. They seem to be
saying, "if only the ruling class had not acted as our political
ideology predicts they would then the Bolshevik revolution would have
been fine"! As Bertrand Russell argued after his trip to Soviet Russia,
while since October 1917 *"the Soviet Government has been at war with
almost all the world, and has at the same time to face civil war at
home"* this was *"not to be regarded as accidental, or as a misfortune
which could not be foreseen. According to Marxian theory, what has
happened was bound to happen."* [**The Theory and Practice of
Bolshevism**, p. 103]

In summary, anarchists are not at all convinced by the claims that
*"objective factors"* can explain the failure of the Russian Revolution.
After all, according to Lenin and Trotsky these factors were to be
expected in **any** revolution -- civil war and invasion, economic
collapse and so forth were not restricted to the Russian revolution.
That is why they say they want a "dictatorship of the proletariat," to
defend against counter-revolution (see [section
H.3.8](secH3.html#sech38) on how, once in power, Lenin and Trotsky
revised this position). Now, if Bolshevism cannot handle what it says is
inevitable, then it should be avoided. To use an analogy:

> **Bolshevik: *"Join with us, we have a great umbrella which will keep
> us dry."***

Not very convincing! Yet, sadly, this is the logic of the common
Leninist justification of Bolshevik authoritarianism during the Russian
Revolution.

3 Can the civil war explain the failure of Bolshevism?
------------------------------------------------------

One of the most common assertions against the anarchists case against
Bolshevism is that while we condemn the Bolsheviks, we fail to mention
the civil war and the wars of intervention. Indeed, for most Leninists
the civil war is usually considered the key event in the development of
Bolshevism, explaining and justifying all anti-socialist acts conducted
by them after they seized power.

For anarchists, such an argument is flawed on two levels, namely logical
and factual. The logical flaw is that Leninist argue that civil war is
inevitable after a revolution. They maintain, correctly, that it is
unlikely that the ruling class will disappear without a fight. Then they
turn round and complain that because the ruling class did what the
Marxists predicted, the Russian Revolution failed! And they
(incorrectly) harp on about anarchists ignoring civil war (see [section
H.2.1](secH2.html#sech21)).

So, obviously, this line of defence is nonsense. If civil war is
inevitable, then it cannot be used to justify the failure of the
Bolshevism. Marxists simply want to have their cake and eat it to. You
simply cannot argue that civil war is inevitable and then blame it for
the failure of the Russian Revolution.

The other flaw in this defence of Bolshevism is the factual one, namely
the awkward fact that Bolshevik authoritarianism started **before** the
civil war broke out. Simply put, it is difficult to blame a course of
actions on an event which had not started yet. Moreover, Bolshevik
authoritarianism **increased** after the civil war finished. This,
incidentally, caused anarchists like Alexander Berkman to re-evaluate
their support for Bolshevism. As he put it, *"I would not concede the
appalling truth. Still the hope persisted that the Bolsheviki, though
absolutely wrong in principle and practice, yet grimly held on to
**some** shreds of the revolutionary banner. 'Allied interference,' 'the
blockade and civil war,' 'the necessity of the transitory stage' -- thus
I sought to placate my outraged conscience . . . At last the fronts were
liquidated, civil war ended, and the country at peace. But Communist
policies did not change. On the contrary . . . The party groaned under
the unbearable yoke of the Party dictatorship. . . . Then came Kronstadt
and its simultaneous echoes throughout the land . . . Kronstadt was
crushed as ruthlessly as Thiers and Gallifet slaughtered the Paris
Communards. And with Kronstadt the entire country and its last hope.
With it also my faith in the Bolsheviki."* [**The Bolshevik Myth**, p.
331]

If Berkman had been in Russia in 1918, he may have realised that the
Bolshevik tyranny during the civil war (which climaxed, post civil war,
with the attack on Kronstadt -- see the appendix on ["What was the
Kronstadt Rebellion?"](append42.html) for more on the Kronstadt
rebellion) was not at odds with their pre-civil war activities to
maintain their power. The simple fact is that Bolshevik authoritarianism
was **not** caused by the pressures of the civil war, rather they
started before then. All the civil war did was strengthen certain
aspects of Bolshevik ideology and practice which had existed from the
start (see the appendix on ["How did Bolshevik ideology contribute to
the failure of the Revolution?"](append44.html)).

While we discuss the Russian Revolution in more detail in the appendix
on ["What happened during the Russian Revolution?"](append41.html), it
is useful to summarise the Bolshevik attacks on working class power and
autonomy before the civil war broke out (i.e. before the end of May
1918).

The most important development during this period was the suppression of
soviet democracy and basic freedoms. As we discuss in [section
6](append41.html#app6) of the appendix on ["What happened during the
Russian Revolution?"](append41.html), the Bolsheviks pursued a policy of
systematically undermining soviet democracy from the moment they seized
power. The first act was the creation of a Bolshevik government over the
soviets, so marginalising the very organs they claimed ruled in Russia.
The process was repeated in the local soviets, with the executive
committees holding real power while the plenary sessions become
infrequent and of little consequence. Come the spring of 1918, faced
with growing working class opposition they started to delay soviet
elections. When finally forced to hold elections, the Bolsheviks
responded in two ways to maintain their power. Either they gerrymandered
the soviets, packing them with representatives of Bolshevik dominated
organisation or they simply disbanded them by force if they lost the
soviet elections (and repressed by force any protests against this).
This was the situation at the grassroots. At the summit of the soviet
system, the Bolsheviks simply marginalised the Central Executive
Committee of the soviets. Real power was held by the Bolshevik
government. The power of the soviets had simply become a fig-leaf for a
"soviet power" -- the handful of Bolsheviks who made up the government
and the party's central committee.

It should be stressed that the Bolshevik assault on the soviets occurred
in March, April and May 1918. That is, **before** the Czech uprising and
the onset of full-scale civil war. So, to generalise, it cannot be said
that it was the Bolshevik party that alone whole-heartedly supported
Soviet power. The facts are that the Bolsheviks only supported *"Soviet
power"* when the soviets were Bolshevik. As recognised by the
left-Menshevik Martov, who argued that the Bolsheviks loved Soviets only
when they were *"in the hands of the Bolshevik party."* [quoted by
Getzler, **Martov**, p. 174] If the workers voted for others, *"soviet
power"* was quickly replaced by party power (the real aim). The
Bolsheviks had consolidated their position in early 1918, turning the
Soviet State into a de facto one party state by gerrymandering and
disbanding of soviets before the start of the Civil War.

Given this legacy of repression, Leninist Tony Cliff's assertion that it
was only *"under the iron pressure of the civil war [that] the Bolshevik
leaders were forced to move, as the price of survival, to **a one-party
system**"* needs serious revising. Similarly, his comment that the
*"civil war undermined the operation of the local soviets"* is equally
inaccurate, as his is claim that *"for some time -- i.e. until the armed
uprising of the Czechoslovak Legion -- the Mensheviks were not much
hampered in their propaganda work."* Simply put, Cliff's statement that
*"it was about a year after the October Revolution before an actual
monopoly of political power was held by one party"* is false. Such a
monopoly existed **before** the start of the civil war, with extensive
political repression existing **before** the uprising of the
Czechoslovak Legion which began it. There was a **de facto** one-party
state by the spring of 1918. [**Lenin**, vol. 3, p. 163, p. 150, p. 167
and p. 172]

The suppression of Soviet democracy reached it logical conclusion in
1921 when the Kronsdadt soviet, heart of the 1917 revolution, was
stormed by Bolshevik forces, its leaders executed or forced into exile
and the rank and file imprisoned, and scattered all over the USSR.
Soviet democracy was not just an issue of debate but one many workers
died in fighting for. As can be seen, similar events to those at
Kronstadt had occurred three years previously.

Before turning to other Bolshevik attacks on working class power and
freedom, we need to address one issue. It will be proclaimed that the
Mensheviks (and SRs) were *"counter-revolutionaries"* and so Bolshevik
actions against them were justified. However, the Bolsheviks' started to
suppress opposition soviets **before** the civil war broke out, so at
the time neither group could be called *"counter-revolutionary"* in any
meaningful sense of the word. The Civil War started on the 25th of May
and the SRs and Mensheviks were expelled from the Soviets on the 14th of
June. While the Bolsheviks *"offered some formidable fictions to justify
the expulsions"* there was *"of course no substance in the charge that
the Mensheviks had been mixed in counter-revolutionary activities on the
Don, in the Urals, in Siberia, with the Czechoslovaks, or that they had
joined the worst Black Hundreds."* [Getzler, **Op. Cit.**, p. 181] The
charge that the Mensheviks *"were active supporters of intervention and
of counter-revolution"* was *"untrue . . . and the Communists, if they
ever believed it, never succeeded in establishing it."* [Schapiro, **Op.
Cit.**, p. 193] The Bolsheviks expelled the Mensheviks in the context of
political loses before the Civil War. As Getzler notes the Bolsheviks
*"drove them underground, just on the eve of the elections to the Fifth
Congress of Soviets in which the Mensheviks were expected to make
significant gains."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 181]

Attacks on working class freedoms and democracy were not limited to the
soviets. As well as the gerrymandering and disbanding of soviets, the
Bolsheviks had already presented economic visions much at odds with what
most people consider as fundamentally socialist. Lenin, in April 1918,
was arguing for one-man management and *"[o]bedience, and unquestioning
obedience at that, during work to the one-man decisions of Soviet
directors, of the dictators elected or appointed by Soviet institutions,
vested with dictatorial powers."* [**Six Theses on the Immediate Tasks
of the Soviet Government**, p. 44] His support for a new form of wage
slavery involved granting state appointed *"individual executives
dictatorial powers (or 'unlimited' powers)."* Large-scale industry
(*"the foundation of socialism"*) required *"thousands subordinating
their will to the will of one,"* and so the revolution "demands" that
*"the people **unquestioningly** obey the single will of the leaders of
labour."* Lenin's *"superior forms of labour discipline"* were simply
hyper-developed capitalist forms. The role of workers in production was
the same, but with a novel twist, namely *"unquestioning obedience to
the orders of individual representatives of the Soviet government during
the work."* [Lenin, **Selected Writings**, vol. 2, p. 610, p. 611, p.
612]

This simply replaced private capitalism with **state** capitalism. *"In
the shops where one-man management (Lenin's own preference) replaced
collegial management,"* notes Diane Koenker, *"workers faced the same
kinds of authoritarian management they thought existed only under
capitalism."* [**Labour Relations in Socialist Russia**, p. 177] If, as
many Leninists claim, one-man management was a key factor in the rise of
Stalinism and/or *"state-capitalism"* in Russia, then, clearly, Lenin's
input in these developments cannot be ignored. After advocating
*"one-man management"* and *"state capitalism"* in early 1918, he
remained a firm supporter of them. In the light of this it is bizarre
that some later day Leninists claim that the Bolsheviks only introduced
one-man management because of the Civil War. Clearly, this was **not**
the case. It was **this** period (before the civil war) that saw Lenin
advocate and start to take the control of the economy out of the hands
of the workers and placed into the hands of the Bolshevik party and the
state bureaucracy.

Needless to say, the Bolshevik undermining of the factory committee
movement and, consequently, genuine worker's self-management of
production in favour of state capitalism cannot be gone into great depth
here (see the appendix on ["What happened during the Russian
Revolution?"](append41.html), for a fuller discussion). Suffice to say,
the factory committees were deliberately submerged in the trade unions
and state control replaced workers' control. This involved practising
one-man management and, as Lenin put in at the start of May 1918, *"our
task is to study the state capitalism of the Germans, to spare **no
effort** in copying it and not to shrink from adopting **dictatorial**
methods to hasten the copying of it."* He stressed that this was no new
idea, rather he *"gave it **before** the Bolsheviks seized power."*
[**Selected Writings**, vol. 2, p. 635 and p. 636]

It will be objected that Lenin advocated *"workers' control."* This is
true, but a *"workers' control"* of a **very** limited nature. As we
discuss in [section H.3.14](secH3.html#sech314), rather than seeing
"workers' control" as workers managing production directly, he always
saw it in terms of workers' *"controlling"* those who did and his views
on this matter were **radically** different to those of the factory
committees. This is not all, as Lenin always placed his ideas in a
statist context -- rather than base socialist reconstruction on working
class self-organisation from below, the Bolsheviks started *"to build,
from the top, its 'unified administration'"* based on central bodies
created by the Tsarist government in 1915 and 1916. [Maurice Brinton,
**The Bolsheviks and Workers' Control**, p. 36] The institutional
framework of capitalism would be utilised as the principal (almost
exclusive) instruments of "socialist" transformation. Lenin's support
for *"one-man management"* must be seen in this context, namely his
vision of "socialism."

Bolshevik advocating and implementing of *"one-man management"* was not
limited to the workplace. On March 30th Trotsky, as Commissar of
Military Affairs, set about reorganising the army. The death penalty for
disobedience under fire was reintroduced, as was saluting officers,
special forms of address, separate living quarters and privileges for
officers. Officers were no longer elected. Trotsky made it clear: *"The
elective basis is politically pointless and technically inexpedient and
has already been set aside by decree."* [quoted by Brinton, **Op.
Cit.**, pp. 37-8] The soldiers were given no say in their fate, as per
bourgeois armies.

Lenin's proposals also struck at the heart of workers' power in other
ways. For example, he argued that *"we must raise the question of
piece-work and apply it . . . in practice."* [**The Immediate Tasks Of
The Soviet Government**, p. 23] As Leninist Tony Cliff (of all people)
noted, *"the employers have at their disposal a number of effective
methods of disrupting th[e] unity [of workers as a class]. Once of the
most important of these is the fostering of competition between workers
by means of piece-work systems."* He notes that these were used by the
Nazis and the Stalinists *"for the same purpose."* [**State Capitalism
in Russia**, pp. 18-9] Obviously piece-work is different when Lenin
introduces it!

Finally, there is the question of general political freedom. It goes
without saying that the Bolsheviks suppressed freedom of the press (for
left-wing opposition groups as well as capitalist ones). It was also in
this time period that the Bolsheviks first used the secret police to
attack opposition groups. Unsurprisingly, this was not directed against
the right. The anarchists in Moscow were attacked on the night of April
11-12, with armed detachments of the Cheka raiding 26 anarchist centres,
killing or wounding 40 and jailing 500. Shortly afterwards the Cheka
carried out similar raids in Petrograd and in the provinces. In May
**Burevestnik**, **Anarkhiia**, **Golos Truda** and other leading
anarchist periodicals closed down. [Paul Avrich, **The Russian
Anarchists**, pp. 184-5] It must surely be a coincidence that there had
been a *"continued growth of anarchist influence among unskilled
workers"* after the October revolution and, equally coincidentally, that
*"[b]y the spring of 1918, very little was heard from the anarchists in
Petrograd."* [David Mandel, **The Petrograd Workers and the Soviet
Seizure of Power**, p. 357]

All this **before** the Trotsky provoked revolt of the Czech legion at
the end of May, 1918, and the consequent "democratic counter-revolution"
in favour of the Constituent Assembly (which the right-Socialist
Revolutionaries led). This, to repeat, was months before the rise of the
White Armies and Allied intervention. In summary, it was **before**
large-scale civil war took place, in an interval of relative peace, that
we see the introduction of most of the measures Leninists now try and
pretend were necessitated by the Civil War itself.

So if anarchists appear to "downplay" the effects of the civil war it is
not because we ignore. We simply recognise that if you think it is
inevitable, you cannot blame it for the actions of the Bolsheviks.
Moreover, when the Bolsheviks eliminated military democracy, undermined
the factory committees, started to disband soviets elected with the
"wrong" majority, repress the anarchists and other left-wing opposition
groups, and so on, **the civil war had not started yet.** So the rot had
started before civil war (and consequent White Terror) and "imperialist
intervention" started. Given that Lenin said that civil war was
inevitable, blaming the inevitable (which had not even started yet!) for
the failure of Bolshevism is **not** very convincing.

This factual problem with the *"civil war caused Bolshevik
authoritarianism"* is the best answer to it. If the Bolsheviks pursued
authoritarian policies before the civil war started, it is hard to
justify their actions in terms of something that had not started yet.
This explains why some Leninists have tried to muddy the waters somewhat
by obscuring when the civil war started. For example, John Rees states
that *"[m]ost historians treat the revolution and the civil war as
separate processes"* yet *"[i]n reality they were one."* He presents a
catalogue of *"armed resistance to the revolution,"* including such
*"precursors of civil war before the revolution"* as the suppression
after the July days and the Kornilov revolt in 1917. [John Rees, *"In
Defence of October,"* pp. 3-82, **International Socialism**, no. 52, p.
31-2]

Ironically, Rees fails to see how this blurring of when the civil war
started actually **harms** Leninism. After all, most historians place
the start of the civil war when the Czech legion revolted **because** it
marked large-scale conflict between armies. It is one thing to say that
authoritarianism was caused by large-scale conflict, another to say
**any** form of conflict caused it. Simply put, if the Bolshevik state
could not handle relatively minor forms of counter-revolution then where
does that leave Lenin's **State and Revolution**? So while the period
from October to May of 1918 was not trouble free, it was not one where
the survival of the new regime looked to be seriously threatened as it
was after that, particularly in 1919 and 1920. Thus "civil war" will be
used, as it is commonly done, to refer to the period from the Czech
revolt (late May 1918) to the final defeat of Wrangel (November 1920).

So, the period from October to May of 1918, while not trouble free, was
not one where the survival of the new regime looked to be seriously
threatened as it was to be in 1919 and 1920. This means attempts to push
the start of the civil war back to October 1917 (or even earlier) simply
weakens the Leninist argument. It still leaves the major problem for the
*"blame it on the civil war"* Leninists, namely to explain why the
months **before** May of 1918 saw soviets being closed down, the start
of the suppression of the factory committees, restrictions on freedom of
speech and association, plus the repression of opposition groups (like
the anarchists). Either any level of "civil war" makes Lenin's **State
and Revolution** redundant or the source of Bolshevik authoritarianism
must be found elsewhere.

That covers the period **before** the start of the civil war. we now
turn to the period **after** it finished. Here we find the same problem,
namely an **increase** of authoritarianism even after the proclaimed
cause for it (civil war) had ended.

After the White General Wrangel was forced back into the Crimea, he had
to evacuate his forced to Constantinople in November 1920. With this
defeat the Russian civil war had come to an end. Those familiar with the
history of the revolution will realise that it was some 4 months
**later** that yet another massive strike wave occurred, the Kronstadt
revolt took place and the 10th Party Congress banned the existence of
factions within the Bolshevik party itself. The repression of the
strikes and Kronstadt revolt effectively destroying hope for mass
pressure for change from below and the latter closing off the very last
"legal" door for those who opposed the regime from the left.

It could be argued that the Bolsheviks were still fighting peasant
insurrections and strikes across the country, but this has everything to
do with Bolshevik policies and could only be considered
*"counter-revolutionary"* if you think the Bolsheviks had a monopoly of
what socialism and revolution meant. In the case of the Makhnovists in
the Ukraine, the Bolsheviks started that conflict by betraying them once
Wrangel had been defeated. As such, any resistance to Bolshevik rule by
the working class and peasantry of Russia indicated the lack of
democracy within the country rather than some sort of
"counter-revolutionary" conflict.

So even the end of the Civil War causes problems for this defence of the
Bolsheviks. Simply put, with the defeat of the Whites it would be
expected that some return to democratic norms would happen. It did not,
in fact the reverse happened. Factions were banned, even the smallest
forms of opposition was finally eliminated from both the party and
society as a whole. Those opposition groups and parties which had been
tolerated during the civil war were finally smashed. Popular revolts for
reform, such as the Kronstadt rebellion and the strike wave which
inspired it, were put down by force (see ["What was the Kronstadt
Rebellion?"](append42.html) on these events). No form of opposition was
tolerated, no freedom allowed. If civil war **was** the cause of
Bolshevik authoritarianism, it seems strange that it got worse after it
was finished.

So, to conclude. Bolshevik authoritarianism did not begun with the start
of the civil war. Anti-socialist policies were being implemented before
it started. Similarly, these policies did not stop when the civil war
ended, indeed the reverse happened. This, then, is the main factual
problem with the *"blame the civil war"* approach. Much of the worst of
the suppression of working class democracy either happened **before**
the Civil War started or **after** it had finished.

As we discuss in ["How did Bolshevik ideology contribute to the failure
of the Revolution?"](append44.html), the root causes for Bolshevik
authoritarian post-October was Bolshevik ideology combined with state
power. After all, how "democratic" is it to give all power to the
Bolshevik party central committee? Surely socialism involves more than
voting for a new government? Is it not about mass participation, the
kind of participation centralised government precludes and Bolshevism
fears as being influenced by *"bourgeois ideology"*? In such
circumstances, moving from party rule to party dictatorship is not such
leap.

That "civil war" cannot explain what happened can be shown by a
counter-example which effectively shows that civil war did not
inevitably mean party dictatorship over a state capitalist economy (and
protesting workers and peasants!). The Makhnovists (an anarchist
influenced partisan army) managed to defend the revolution and encourage
soviet democracy, freedom of speech, and so on, while doing so (see the
appendix ["Why does the Makhnovist movement show there is an alternative
to Bolshevism?"](append46.html) discusses the Makhnovists in some
detail). In fact, the Bolsheviks tried to **ban** their soviet
congresses. Which, of course, does not really fit in with the Bolsheviks
being forced to be anti-democratic due to the pressures of civil war.

So, in summary, civil war and imperialist intervention cannot be blamed
for Bolshevik authoritarianism simply because the latter had started
before the former existed. Moreover, the example of the Makhnovists
suggests that Bolshevik policies during the civil war were also not
driven purely by the need for survival. As Kropotkin argued at the time,
*"all foreign armed intervention necessarily strengthens the dictatorial
tendencies of the government . . . The evils inherent in a party
dictatorship have been accentuated by the conditions of war in which
this party maintains its power. This state of war has been the pretext
for strengthening dictatorial methods which centralise the control of
every detail of life in the hands of the government, with the effect of
stopping an immense part of the ordinary activity of the country. The
evils natural to state communism have been increased ten-fold under the
pretext that all our misery is due to foreign intervention."*
[**Kropotkin's Revolutionary Pamphlets**, p. 253]

In other words, while the civil war may have increased Bolshevik
authoritarianism, it did not create it nor did it end with the ending of
hostilities.

4 Did economic collapse and isolation destroy the revolution?
-------------------------------------------------------------

One of the most common explanations for the failure revolution is that
the Bolsheviks faced a terrible economic conditions, which forced them
to be less than democratic. Combined with the failure of the revolution
to spread to more advanced countries, party dictatorship, it is argued,
was inevitable. In the words of one Leninist:

> *"In a country where the working class was a minority of the
> population, where industry had been battered by years of war and in
> conditions of White and imperialist encirclement, the balance
> gradually titled towards greater coercion. Each step of the way was
> forced on the Bolsheviks by dire and pressing necessities."* [John
> Rees, *"In Defence of October,"* **International Socialism**, no. 52,
> p. 41]

He talks of *"economic devastation"* [p. 31] and quotes various sources,
including Victor Serge. According to Serge, the *"decline in production
was uninterrupted. It should be noted that this decline had already
begun before the revolution. In 1916 the output of agricultural
machinery, for example, was down by 80 per cent compared with 1913. The
year 1917 had been marked by a particularly general, rapid and serious
downturn. The production figures for the principal industries in 1913
and 1918 were, in millions of **poods**: coal, from 1,738 to 731 (42 per
cent); iron ore, from 57, 887 to 1,686; cast-iron, from 256 to 31.5
(12.3 per cent); steel, from 259 to 24.5; rails, from 39.4 to 1.1. As a
percentage of 1913 production, output of linen fell to 75 per cent, of
sugar to 24 per cent, and tobacco to 19 per cent."* Moreover, production
continued *"to fall until the end of civil war . . . For 1920, the
following indices are given as a percentage of output in 1913: coal, 27
per cent; cast iron, 2.4 per cent; linen textiles, 38 per cent."*
[**Year One of the Russian Revolution**, p. 352 and p. 425]

According to Tony Cliff (another of Rees's references), the war-damaged
industry *"continued to run down"* in the spring of 1918: *"One of the
causes of famine was the breakdown of transport . . . Industry was in a
state of complete collapse. Not only was there no food to feed the
factory workers; there was no raw material or fuel for industry . . .
The collapse of industry meant unemployment for the workers."* Cliff
provides economic indexes. For large scale industry, taking 1913 as the
base, 1917 saw production fall to 77%. In 1918, it was at 35% of the
1913 figure, 1919 it was 26% and 1920 was 18%. Productivity per worker
also fell, from 85% in 1917, to 44% in 1918, 22% in 1919 and then 26% in
1920. [**Lenin**, vol. 3, pp. 67-9, p. 86 and p. 85]

In such circumstances, it is argued, how can you expect the Bolsheviks
to subscribe to democratic and socialist norms? This meant that the
success or failure of the revolution depended on whether the revolution
spread to more advanced countries. Leninist Duncan Hallas argues that
the *"failure of the German Revolution in 1918-19 . . . seems, in
retrospect, to have been decisive . . . for only substantial economic
aid from an advanced economy, in practice from a socialist Germany,
could have reversed the disintegration of the Russian working class."*
[*"Towards a revolutionary socialist party,"* pp. 38-55, **Party and
Class**, Alex Callinicos (ed.), p. 44]

Anarchists are not convinced by these arguments. This is for two
reasons.

Firstly, we are aware that revolutions are disruptive no matter where
they occur (see [section 1](append43.html#app1)) Moreover, Leninists are
meant to know this to. Simply put, there is a certain incredulous
element to these arguments. After all, Lenin himself had argued that
*"[e]very revolution . . . by its very nature implies a crisis, and a
very deep crisis at that, both political and economic. This is
irrespective of the crisis brought about by the war."* [**Collected
Works**, vol. 30, p. 341] Serge also considered crisis as inevitable,
arguing that the *"conquest of production by the proletariat was in
itself a stupendous victory, one which saved the revolution's life.
Undoubtedly, so thorough a recasting of all the organs of production is
impossible without a substantial decline in output; undoubtedly, too, a
proletariat cannot labour and fight at the same time."* [**Op. Cit.**,
p. 361] As we discussed in detail in [section 2](append43.html#app2),
this was a common Bolshevik position at the time (which, in turn,
belatedly echoed anarchist arguments -- see [section
1](append43.html#app1)). And if we look at other revolutions, we can say
that this is the case.

Secondly, and more importantly, every revolution or near revolutionary
situation has been accompanied by economic crisis. For example, as we
will shortly prove, Germany itself was in a state of serious economic
collapse in 1918 and 1919, a collapse which would have got worse is a
Bolshevik-style revolution had occurred there. This means that **if**
Bolshevik authoritarianism is blamed on the state of the economy, it is
not hard to conclude that **every** Bolshevik-style revolution will
suffer the same fate as the Russian one.

As we noted in [section 1](append43.html#app1), Kropotkin had argued
from the 1880s that a revolution would be accompanied by economic
disruption. Looking at subsequent revolutions, he has been vindicated
time and time again. Every revolution has been marked by economic
disruption and falling production. This suggests that the common
Leninist idea that a successful revolution in, say, Germany would have
ensured the success of the Russian Revolution is flawed. Looking at
Europe during the period immediately after the first world war, we
discover great economic hardship. To quote one Trotskyist editor:

> *"In the major imperialist countries of Europe, production still had
> not recovered from wartime destruction. A limited economic upswing in
> 1919 and early 1920 enabled many demobilised soldiers to find work,
> and unemployment fell somewhat. Nonetheless, in 'victorious' France
> overall production in 1920 was still only two-thirds its pre-war
> level. In Germany industrial production was little more than half its
> 1914 level, human consumption of grains was down 44 per cent, and the
> economy was gripped by spiralling inflation. Average per capita wages
> in Prague in 1920, adjusted for inflation, were just over one-third of
> pre-war levels."* [John Riddell, *"Introduction,"* **Proceedings and
> Documents of the Second Congress, 1920**, vol. I, p. 17]

Now, if economic collapse was responsible for Bolshevik authoritarianism
and the subsequent failure of the revolution, it seems hard to
understand why an expansion of the revolution into similarly crisis
ridden countries would have had a major impact in the development of the
revolution. Since most Leninists agree that the German Revolution, we
will discuss this in more detail before going onto other revolutions.

By 1918, Germany was in a bad state. Victor Serge noted *"the famine and
economic collapse which caused the final ruin of the Central Powers."*
[**Op. Cit.**, p. 361] The semi-blockade of Germany during the war badly
effected the economy, the *"dynamic growth"* of which before the war
*"had been largely dependent on the country's involvement in the world
market"*. The war *"proved catastrophic to those who had depended on the
world market and had been involved in the production of consumer goods .
. . Slowly but surely the country slithered into austerity and
ultimately economic collapse."* Food production suffered, with *"overall
food production declined further after poor harvests in 1916 and 1917.
Thus grain production, already well below its prewar levels, slumped
from 21.8 million to 14.9 million tons in those two years."* [V. R.
Berghahn, **Modern Germany**, p. 47, pp. 47-8, p. 50]

The parallels with pre-revolution Russia are striking and it is hardly
surprising that revolution did break out in Germany in November 1918.
Workers' councils sprang up all across the country, inspired in part by
the example of the Russian soviets (and what people **thought** was
going on in Russia under the Bolsheviks). A Social-Democratic government
was founded, which used the Free Corps (right-wing volunteer troops) to
crush the revolution from January 1919 onwards. This meant that Germany
in 1919 was marked by extensive civil war within the country. In January
1920, a state of siege was re-introduced across half the country.

This social turmoil was matched by economic turmoil. As in Russia,
Germany faced massive economic problems, problems which the revolution
inherited. Taking 1928 as the base year, the index of industrial
production in Germany was slightly lower in 1913, namely 98 in 1913 to
100 in 1928. In other words, Germany effectively lost 15 years of
economic activity. In 1917, the index was 63 and by 1918 (the year of
the revolution), it was 61 (i.e. industrial production had dropped by
nearly 40%). In 1919, it fell again to 37, rising to 54 in 1920 and 65
in 1921. Thus, in 1919, the *"industrial production reached an all-time
low"* and it *"took until the late 1920s for [food] production to
recover its 1912 level . . . In 1921 grain production was still . . .
some 30 per cent below the 1912 figure."* Coal production was 69.1% of
its 1913 level in 1920, falling to 32.8% in 1923. Iron production was
33.1% in 1920 and 25.6% in 1923. Steel production likewise fell to 48.5%
in 1920 and fell again to 36% in 1923. [V. R. Berghahn, **Op. Cit.**, p.
258, pp. 67-8, p. 71 and p. 259]

Significantly, one of the first acts of the Bolshevik government towards
the new German government was to *"the offer by the Soviet authorities
of two trainloads of grain for the hungry German population. It was a
symbolical gesture and, in view of desperate shortages in Russia itself,
a generous one."* The offer, perhaps unsurprisingly, was rejected in
favour of grain from America. [E.H. Carr, **The Bolshevik Revolution**,
vol. 3, p. 106]

The similarities between Germany and Russia are clear. As noted above,
in Russia, the index for large scale industry fell to 77 in 1917 from
100 in 1913, falling again to 35 in 1918, 26 in 1919 and 18 in 1920.
[Tony Cliff, **Lenin**, vol. 3, p. 86] In other words, a fall of 23%
between 1913 and 1917, 54.5% between 1917 and 1918, 25.7% in 1918 and
30.8% in 1919. A similar process occurred in Germany, where the fall
production was 37.7% between 1913 and 1917, 8.2% between 1917 and 1918
and 33.9% between 1918 and 1919 (the year of revolution). While
production did rise in 1920 by 45.9%, production was still around 45%
less than before the war.

Thus, comparing the two countries we discover a similar picture of
economic collapse. In the year the revolution started, production had
fallen by 23% in Russia (from 1913 to 1917) and by 43% in Germany (from
1913 to 1918). Once revolution had effectively started, production fell
even more. In Russia, it fell to 65% of its pre-war level in 1918, in
Germany it fell to 62% of its pre-war level in 1919. Of course, in
Germany revolution did not go as far as in Russia, and so production did
rise somewhat in 1920 and afterwards. What is significant is that in
1923, production fell dramatically by 34% (from around 70% of its
pre-war level to around 45% of that level). This economic collapse did
not deter the Communists from trying to provoke a revolution in Germany
that year, so suggesting that economic disruption played no role in
their evaluation of the success of a revolution.

This economic chaos in Germany is never mentioned by Leninists when they
discuss the *"objective factors"* facing the Russian Revolution.
However, once these facts are taken into account, the superficiality of
the typical Leninist explanation for the degeneration of the revolution
becomes obvious. The very problems which, it is claimed, forced the
Bolsheviks to act as they did also were rampant in Germany. If economic
collapse made socialism impossible in Russia, it would surely have had
the same effect in Germany (and any social revolution would also have
faced more disruption than actually faced post 1919 in Germany). This
means, given that the economic collapse in both 1918/19 and 1923 was as
bad as that facing Russia in 1918 and that the Bolsheviks had started to
undermine soviet and military democracy along with workers' control by
spring and summer of that year (see [section 5](append43.html#app5)), to
blame Bolshevik actions on economic collapse would mean that any German
revolution would have been subject to the same authoritarianism **if**
the roots of Bolshevik authoritarianism were forced by economic events
rather than a product of applying a specific political ideology via
state power. Few Leninists draw this obvious conclusion from their own
arguments although there is no reason for them not to.

So the German Revolution was facing the same problems the Russian one
was. It seems unlikely, therefore, that a successful German revolution
would have been that much aid to Russia. This means that when John Rees
argues that giving machinery or goods to the peasants in return for
grain instead of simply seizing it required *"revolution in Germany, or
at least the revival of industry"* in Russia, he completely fails to
indicate the troubles facing the German revolution. *"Without a
successful German revolution,"* he writes, *"the Bolsheviks were thrown
back into a bloody civil war with only limited resources. The revolution
was under siege."* [John Rees, *"In Defence of October,"* pp. 3-82,
**International Socialism**, no. 52, p. 40 and p. 29] Yet given the
state of the German economy at the time, it is hard to see how much help
a successful German revolution would have been. As such, his belief that
a successful German Revolution would have mitigated Bolshevik
authoritarianism seems exactly that, a belief without any real evidence
to support it (and let us not forget, Bolshevik authoritarianism had
started before the civil war broke out -- see [section
3](append43.html#app3)). Moreover, **if** the pro-Bolshevik argument
Rees is expounding **is** correct, then the German Revolution would have
been subject to the same authoritarianism as befell the Bolshevik one
simply because it was facing a similar economic crisis. Luckily,
anarchists argue, that this need not be the case if libertarian
principles are applied in a revolution:

> *"The first months of emancipation will inevitably increase
> consumption of goods and production will diminish. And, furthermore,
> any country achieving social revolution will be surrounded by a ring
> of neighbours either unfriendly or actually enemies . . . The demands
> upon products will increase while production decreases, and finally
> famine will come. There is only one way of avoiding it. We should
> understand that as soon as a revolutionary movement begins in any
> country the only possible way out will consist in the workingmen [and
> women] and peasants from the beginning taking the whole national
> economy into their hands and organising it themselves . . . But they
> will not be convinced of this necessity except when all responsibility
> for national economy, today in the hands of a multitude of ministers
> and committees, is presented in a simple form to each village and
> city, in every factory and shop, as their own affair, and when they
> understand that they must direct it themselves."* [**Kropotkin's
> Revolutionary Pamphlets**, pp. 77-8]

So, as regards the Russian and German revolution, Kropotkin's arguments
were proven correct. The same can be said of other revolutions as well.
Basing himself on the actual experiences of both the French Revolution
and the Paris Commune, we can see why Kropotkin argued as he did. The
Paris Commune, for example, was born after a four-month-long siege *"had
left the capital in a state of economic collapse. The winter had been
the severest in living memory. Food and fuel had been the main problems
. . . Unemployment was widespread. Thousands of demobilised soldiers
wandered loose in Paris and joined in the general hunt for food, shelter
and warmth. For most working men the only source of income was the 1.50
francs daily pay of the National Guard, which in effect had become a
form of unemployment pay."* The city was *"near starving"* and by March
it was *"in a state of economic and political crisis."* [Stewart
Edwards, *"Introduction,"* **The Communards of Paris, 1871**, p. 23] Yet
this economic collapse and isolation did not stop the commune from
introducing and maintaining democratic forms of decision making, both
political and economic. A similar process occurred during the French
Revolution, where mass participation via the *"sections"* was not
hindered by economic collapse. It was finally stopped by state action
organised by the Jacobins to destroy popular participation and
initiative (see Kropotkin's **The Great French Revolution** for
details).

During the Spanish Revolution, *"overall Catalan production fell in the
first year of war by 30 per cent, and in the cotton-working sector of
the textile industry by twice as much. Overall unemployment (complete
and partial) rose by nearly a quarter in the first year, and this
despite the military mobilisation decreed in September 1936. The cost of
living quadrupled in just over two years; wages . . . only doubled."*
[Ronald Fraser, **Blood of Spain**, p. 234] Markets, both internally and
externally, for goods and raw materials were disrupted, not to mention
the foreign blockade and the difficulties imposed in trying to buy
products from other countries. These difficulties came on top of
problems caused by the great depression of the 1930s which affected
Spain along with most other countries. Yet, democratic norms of economic
and social decision making continued in spite of economic disruption.
Ironically, given the subject of this discussion, it was only once the
Stalinist counter-revolution got going were they fatally undermined or
destroyed.

Thus economic disruption need not automatically imply authoritarian
policies. And just as well, given the fact that revolution and economic
disruption seem to go hand in hand.

Looking further afield, even **revolutionary** situations can be
accompanied with economic collapse. For example, the Argentine revolt
which started in 2001 took place in the face of massive economic
collapse. The economy was a mess, with poverty and unemployment at
disgusting levels. Four years of recession saw the poverty rate balloon
from 31 to 53 percent of the population of 37 million, while
unemployment climbed from 14 to 21.4 percent, according to official
figures. Yet in the face of such economic problems, working class people
acted collectively, forming popular assemblies and taking over
workplaces.

The Great Depression of the 1930s in America saw a much deeper economic
contradiction. Indeed, it was as bad as that associated with
revolutionary Germany and Russia after the first world war. According to
Howard Zinn, after the stock market crash in 1929 *"the economy was
stunned, barely moving. Over five thousand banks closed and huge numbers
of businesses, unable to get money, closed too. Those that continued
laid off employees and cut the wages of those who remained, again and
again. Industrial production fell by 50 percent, and by 1933 perhaps 15
million (no knew exactly) -- one-forth or one-third of the labour force
-- were out of work."* [**A People's History of the United States**, p.
378]

Specific industries were badly affected. For example, total GNP fell to
53.6% in 1933 compared to its 1929 value. The production of basic goods
fell by much more. Iron and Steel saw a 59.3% decline, machinery a 61.6%
decline and *"non-ferrous metals and products"* a 55.9% decline.
Transport was also affected, with transportation equipment declining by
64.2% railroad car production dropping by 73.6% and locomotion
production declining by 86.4%. Furniture production saw a decline of
57.9%. The workforce was equally affected, with unemployment reaching
25% in 1933. In Chicago 40% of the workforce was unemployed. Union
membership, which had fallen from 5 million in 1920 to 3.4 million in
1929 fell to less than 3 million by 1933. [Lester V. Chandler,
**America's Greatest Depression, 1929-1941**, p. 20, p. 23, p. 34, p. 45
and p. 228]

Yet in the face of this economic collapse, no Leninist proclaimed the
impossibility of socialism. In fact, the reverse what the case. Similar
arguments could apply to, say, post-world war two Europe, when economic
collapse and war damage did not stop Trotskyists looking forward to, and
seeking, revolutions there. Nor did the massive economic that occurred
after the fall of Stalinism in Russia in the early 1990s deter Leninist
calls for revolution. Indeed, you can rest assured that any drop in
economic activity, no matter how large or small, will be accompanied by
Leninist articles arguing for the immediate introduction of socialism.
And this was the case in 1917 as well, when economic crisis had been a
fact of Russian life throughout the year. Lenin, for example, argued at
the end of September of that *"Russia is threatened with an inevitable
catastrophe . . .A catastrophe of extraordinary dimensions, and a
famine, are unavoidably threatening . . . Half a year of revolution has
passed. The catastrophe has come still closer. Things have come to a
state of mass unemployment. Think of it: the country is suffering from a
lack of commodities."* [**The Threatening Catastrophe and how to Fight
It**, p. 5] This did not stop him calling for revolution and seizing
power. Nor did this crisis stop the creation of democratic working class
organisations, such as soviets, trade unions and factory committees
being formed. It did not stop mass collective action to combat those
difficulties. It appears, therefore, that while the economic crisis of
1917 did not stop the development of socialist tendencies to combat it,
the seizure of power by a socialist party did.

Given that no Leninist has argued that a revolution could take place in
Germany after the war or in the USA during the darkest months of the
Great Depression, the argument that the grim economic conditions facing
Bolshevik Russia made soviet democracy impossible seem weak. By arguing
that both Germany and the USA could create a viable socialist revolution
in economic conditions just as bad as those facing Soviet Russia, the
reasons why the Bolsheviks created a party dictatorship must be looked
for elsewhere. Given this support for revolution in 1930s America and
post-world war I and II Europe, you would have to conclude that, for
Leninists, economic collapse only makes socialism impossible once
**they** are in power! Which is hardly convincing, or inspiring.

5 Was the Russian working class atomised or *"declassed"*?
----------------------------------------------------------

A standard Leninist explanation for the dictatorship of the Bolshevik
party (and subsequent rise of Stalinism) is based on the *"atomisation"*
or *"declassing"* of the proletariat. John Rees summarises this argument
as follows:

> *"The civil war had reduced industry to rubble. The working class base
> of the workers' state, mobilises time and again to defeat the Whites,
> the rock on which Bolshevik power stood, had disintegrated. The
> Bolsheviks survived three years of civil war and wars in intervention,
> but only at the cost of reducing the working class to an atomised,
> individualised mass, a fraction of its former size, and no longer able
> to exercise the collective power that it had done in 1917 . . . The
> bureaucracy of the workers' state was left suspended in mid-air, its
> class base eroded and demoralised. Such conditions could not help but
> have an effect on the machinery of the state and organisation of the
> Bolshevik Party."* [*"In Defence of October,"* pp. 3-82,
> **International Socialism**, no. 52, p. 65]

It is these objective factors which, it is argued, explain why the
Bolshevik party substituted itself for the Russian working class.
*"Under such conditions,"* argues Tony Cliff, *"the class base of the
Bolshevik Party disintegrated -- not because of some mistakes in the
policies of Bolshevism, not because of one or another conception of
Bolshevism regarding the role of the party and its relation to the class
-- but because of mightier historical factors. The working class had
become declassed . . . Bolshevik 'substitutionism' . . . did not jump
out of Lenin's head as Minerva out of Zeus's, but was born of the
objective conditions of civil war in a peasant country, where a small
working class, reduced in weight, became fragmented and dissolved into
the peasant masses."* [**Trotsky on Substitutionism**, pp. 62-3] In
other words, because the working class was so decimated the replacement
of class power by party power was inevitable.

Before discussing this argument, we should point out that this argument
dates back to Lenin. For example, he argued in 1921 that the
proletariat, *"owning to the war and to the desperate poverty and ruin,
has become declassed, i.e. dislodged from its class groove, and had
ceased to exist as proletariat . . . the proletariat has disappeared."*
[**Collected Works**, vol. 33, p. 66] However, unlike his later-day
followers, Lenin was sure that while it *"would be absurd and ridiculous
to deny that the fact that the proletariat is declassed is a handicap"*
it could still *"fulfil its task of wining and holding state power."*
[**Op. Cit.**, vol. 32, p. 412] As we will see, the context in which
Lenin started to make these arguments is important.

Anarchists do not find these arguments particularly convincing. This is
for two reasons. Firstly, it seems incredulous to blame the civil war
for the *"substitution"* of Bolshevik power for working class power as
party power had been Lenin's stated aim in 1917 and October saw the
seizure of power by the Bolsheviks, **not** the soviets. As we saw in
[section 3](append43.html#app3), the Bolsheviks started to gerrymander
and disband soviets to remain in power **before** the civil war started.
As such, to blame the civil war and the problems it caused for the
usurpation of power by the Bolsheviks seems unconvincing. Simply put,
the Bolsheviks had *"substituted"* itself for the proletariat from the
start, from the day it seized power in the October revolution.

Secondly, the fact is the Russian working class was far from
*"atomised."* Rather than being incapable of collective action, as
Leninists assert, Russia's workers were more than capable of taking
collective action throughout the civil war period. The problem is, of
course, that any such collective action was directed **against** the
Bolshevik party. This caused the party no end of problems. After all, if
the working class **was** the ruling class under the Bolsheviks, then
who was it striking against? Emma Goldman explains the issue well:

> *"In my early period the question of strikes had puzzled me a great
> deal. People had told me that the least attempt of that kind was
> crushed and the participants sent to prison. I had not believed it,
> and, as in all similar things, I turned to Zorin [a Bolshevik] for
> information. 'Strikes under the dictatorship of the proletariat!' he
> had proclaimed; 'there's no such thing.' He had even upbraided me for
> crediting such wild and impossible tales. Against whom, indeed, should
> the workers strike in Soviet Russia, he argued. Against themselves?
> They were the masters of the country, politically as well as
> industrially. To be sure, there were some among the toilers who were
> not yet fully class-conscious and aware of their own true interests.
> These were sometimes disgruntled, but they were elements incited by .
> . . self-seekers and enemies of the Revolution."* [**Living My Life**,
> vol. 2, p. 872]

This, unfortunately, still seems to be the case in pro-Bolshevik
accounts of the Revolution and its degeneration. After the Bolshevik
seizure of power, the working class as an active agent almost
immediately disappears from the accounts. This is unsurprising, as it
does not bode well for maintaining the Bolshevik Myth to admit that
workers were resisting the so-called *"proletarian dictatorship"* from
the start. The notion that the working class had *"disappeared"* fits
into this selective blindness well. Why discuss the actions of a class
which did not exist? Thus we have a logical circle from which reality
can be excluded: the working class is *"atomised"* and so cannot take
industrial action, evidence of industrial action need not be looked for
because the class is *"atomised."*

This can be seen from Lenin. For example, he proclaimed in October 1921
that *"the proletariat had disappeared."* Yet this non-existent class
had, in early 1921, taken collective action which *"encompassed most of
the country's industrial regions."* [J. Aves, **Workers Against Lenin**,
p. 111] Significantly, the Communists (then and now) refused to call the
movement a strike, preferring the word *"volynka"* which means
*"go-slow."* The Menshevik leader Dan explained why: *"The Bolshevik
press carefully tried, at first, to hush up the movement, then to hide
its real size and character. Instead of calling the strike a strike,
they thought up various new terms -- **yolynka,** **buza** and so on."*
[quoted by Aves, **Op. Cit.**, p. 112] As Russian anarchist Ida Mett
succinctly put it: *"And if the proletariat was that exhausted how come
it was still capable of waging virtually total general strikes in the
largest and most heavily industrialised cities?"* [Ida Mett, **The
Kronstadt Rebellion**, p. 81]

The year after Lenin proclaimed the proletariat *"disappeared"* we
discover similar evidence of working class collective action.
Ironically, it is Leninist Tony Cliff who presents the evidence that
*"the number of workers involved in labour conflicts was three and a
half million, and in 1923, 1,592,800."* Strikes in state-owned
workplaces in 1922 involved 192,000 workers. [**State Capitalism in
Russia**, p. 28] Given that Cliff states that in 1921 there was only
*"one and a quarter million"* industrial workers *"proper"* (compared to
over three million in 1917), this level of strikes is extremely large --
particular for members of a class which did not, according to Lenin
which had *"disappeared"*!

Before providing more evidence for the existence of working class
collective struggle throughout the period 1918 to 1923, it is necessary
to place Lenin's comments on the *"declassing"* of the working class in
context. Rather than being the result of a lack of industrial protest,
Lenin's arguments were the product of its opposite -- the rise in
collective struggle by the Russian working class. As one historian
notes: *"As discontent amongst workers became more and more difficult to
ignore, Lenin . . . began to argue that the consciousness of the working
class had deteriorated . . . workers had become 'declassed.'"* *"Lenin's
analysis,"* he continues, *"had a superficial logic but it was based on
a false conception of working-class consciousness. There is little
evidence to suggest that the demands that workers made at the end of
1920 . . . represented a fundamental change in aspirations since 1917 .
. . [Moreover] an analysis of the industrial unrest in 1921 shows that
long-standing workers were prominent in protest."* [J. Aves, **Op.
Cit.**, p. 90 and pp. 90-1]

Lenin's pessimistic analysis of 1921 is in sharp contrast to the
optimistic mood of early 1920, reproduced by the defeat of the White
armies, in Bolshevik ranks. For example, writing in May, 1920, Trotsky
seemed oblivious to the *"atomisation"* of the Russian working class,
arguing that *"in spite of political tortures, physical sufferings and
horrors, the labouring masses are infinitely distinct from political
decomposition, from moral collapse, or from apathy . . . Today, in all
branches of industry, there is going on an energetic struggle for the
establishment of strict labour discipline, and for the increase of the
productivity of labour. The party organisations, the trade unions, the
factory and workshop administrative committees, rival each one another
in this respect, with the undivided support of the working class as a
whole."* Indeed, they *"concentrate their attention and will on
collective problems"* (*"Thanks to a regime which . . . given their life
a pursue"*!). Needless to say, the party had *"the undivided support of
the public opinion of the working class as a whole."* [**Terrorism and
Communism**, p. 6]

The turn around in perspective after this period did not happen by
accident, independently of the working class resistance to Bolshevik
rule. After all, the defeat of the Whites in early of 1920 saw the
Bolsheviks take *"victory as a sign of the correctness of its
ideological approach and set about the task of reconstruction on the
basis of an intensification of War Communism policies with redoubled
determination."* This led to *"an increase in industrial unrest in
1920,"* including *"serious strikes."* The resistance was *"becoming
increasingly politicised."* Thus, the stage was set for Lenin's turn
around and his talk of *"declassing."* In early 1921 *"Lenin argued that
workers, who were no more demoralised than they were in early 1920, had
become 'declassed' in order to justify a political clamp-down."* [J.
Aves, **Op. Cit.**, p. 37, p. 80 and p. 18]

Other historians also note this context. For example, while the
*"working class had decreased in size and changed in composition, . . .
the protest movement from late 1920 made clear that it was not a
negligible force and that in an inchoate way it retained a vision of
socialism which was not identified entirely with Bolshevik power . . .
Lenin's arguments on the declassing of the proletariat was more a way of
avoiding this unpleasant truth than a real reflection of what remained,
in Moscow at least, a substantial physical and ideological force."*
[Richard Sakwa, Soviet Communists in Power, p. 261] In the words of
Diane Koenker, *"[i]f Lenin's perceptions of the situation were at all
representative, it appears that the Bolshevik party made deurbanisation
and declassing the scapegoat for its political difficulties, when the
party's own policies and its unwillingness to accept changing
proletarian attitudes were also to blame."* Ironically, this was not the
first time that the Bolsheviks had blamed its problems on the lack of a
*"true"* proletariat and its replacement by "petty-bourgeois" elements,
*"[t]his was the same argument used to explain the Bolsheviks' lack of
success in the early months of 1917 -- that the cadres of conscious
proletarians were diluted by non-proletarian elements."* [*"Urbanisation
and Deurbanisation in the Russian Revolution and Civil War,"* pp.
424-450, **The Journal of Modern History**, vol. 57, no. 3, p. 449 and
p. 428]

It should be noted that the *"declassing"* argument does have a
superficial validity if you accept the logic of vanguardism. After all,
if you accept the premise that the party alone represents socialist
consciousness and that the working class, by its own efforts, can only
reach a reformist level of political conscious (at best), then any
deviation in working class support for the party obviously represents a
drop in class consciousness or a *"declassing"* of the proletariat (see
section H.5.1 -- *["Why are vanguard parties
anti-socialist?"](secH5.html#sech51)*). Thus working class protest
against the party can be dismissed as evidence of *"declassing"* which
has to be suppressed rather than what it really is, namely evidence of
working class autonomy and collective struggle for what it considers
**its** interests to be against a new master class. In fact, the
*"declassing"* argument is related to the vanguardist position which, in
turn, justifies the dictatorship of the party **over** the class (see
section H.5.3 -- *["Why does vanguardism imply party
power?"](secH5.html#sech53)*).

So the *"declassing"* argument is not some neutral statement of fact. It
was developed as a weapon on the class struggle, to justify Bolshevik
repression of collective working class struggle. To justify the
continuation of Bolshevik party dictatorship **over** the working class.
This in turn explains why working class struggle during this period
generally fails to get mentioned by later day Bolsheviks -- it simply
undermines their justifications for Bolshevik dictatorship. After all,
how can they say that the working class could not exercise *"collective
power"* when it was conducting mass strikes throughout Russia during the
period 1918 to 1923?

As such, it does not seem that strange that in most Leninist account of
the revolution post-October rarely, if ever, mention what the working
class was actually doing. We do get statistics on the drop of the
numbers of industrial workers in the cities (usually Petrograd and
Moscow), but any discussion on working class protest and strikes is
generally, at best, mentioned in passing or, usually, ignored utterly.
Given this was meant to be a *"proletarian"* dictatorship, it seems
strange this silence. It could be argued that this silence is due to the
working class being decimated in number and/or *"declassed"* in terms of
itself perspective. This, however, seems unlikely, as collective working
class protest was common place in Bolshevik Russia. The silence can be
better understood by the fact this protest was directed **against** the
Bolsheviks.

Which shows the bankruptcy of what can be called the *"statistical
tendency"* of analysing the Russian working class. While statistics can
tell us how many workers remained in Russia in, say, 1921, it does not
prove any idea of their combativeness or their ability to take
collective decisions and action. If numbers alone indicated the ability
of workers to take part in collective struggle, then the massive labour
struggles in 1930s American would not have taken place. Millions had
been made redundant. At the Ford Motor Company, 128,000 workers had been
employed in the spring of 1929. There were only 37,000 by August of 1931
(only 29% of the 1929 figure). By the end of 1930, almost half of the
280,000 textile mill workers in New England were out of work. [Howard
Zinn, **A People's History of the United States**, p. 378] Yet in the
face of these massive redundancies, the workers organised themselves and
fought back. As we will indicate, the reduction in the number of Russian
workers did not restrict their ability to make collective decisions and
act collectively on them -- Bolshevik repression **did.**

Moreover, while Leninists usually point to the fall in population in
Petrograd and Moscow during the civil war, concentrating on these cities
can be misleading. *"Using the Petrograd figures,"* notes Daniel R.
Bower, *"historians have painted a lurid picture of flight from the
cities. In 1918 alone the former capital lost 850,000 people and was by
itself responsible for one-half of the total urban population decline of
the Civil War years. If one sets aside aggregate figures to determine
the trend characteristic of most cities, however, the experiences of
Petrograd appears exception. Only a handful of cities . . . lost half
their population between 1917 and 1920, and even Moscow, which declined
by over 40 percent, was not typical of most towns in the northern,
food-importing areas. A study of all cities . . . found that the average
decline in the north (167 towns in all, excluding the capital cities)
amounted to 24 percent between 1917 and 1920. Among the towns in the
food-producing areas in the southern and eastern regions of the Russian
Republic (a total of 128), the average decline came to only 14
percent."* [*"'The city in danger': The Civil War and the Russian Urban
Population,"* **Party, State, and Society in the Russian Civil War**,
Diane P. Koenker, William G. Rosenberg and Ronald Grigor Suny (eds.), p.
61] Does this mean that the possibility of soviet democracy declined
less in these towns? Yet the Bolsheviks applied their dictatorships even
there, suggesting that declining urban populations was not the source of
their authoritarianism.

Equally, what are we to make of towns and cities which increased their
populations? Some towns and cites actually grew in size. For example,
Minsk, Samara, Khar'kov, Tiflis, Baku, Rostov-on-don, Tsaritsyn and Perm
all grew in population (often by significant amounts) between 1910 and
1920 while other cities shrunk. [Diane Koenker, *"Urbanisation and
Deurbanisation in the Russian Revolution and Civil War,"* pp. 424-450,
**The Journal of Modern History**, vol. 57, no. 3, p. 425] Does that
mention soviet democracy was possible in those towns but not in
Petrograd or Moscow? Or does the fact that the industrial workforce grew
by 14.8% between October 1920 and April 1921 mean that the possibility
for soviet democracy also grew by a similar percentage? [J. Aves,
**Workers Against Lenin**, p. 159]

Then there is the question of when the reduction of workers makes soviet
democracy impossible. After all, between May 1917 and April 1918 the
city of Moscow lost 300,000 of its two million inhabitants. Was soviet
democracy impossible in April 1918 because of this? During the civil
war, Moscow lost another 700,000 by 1920 (which is basically the same
amount per year). [Diane Koenker, **Op. Cit.**, p. 424] When did this
fall in population mean that soviet democracy was impossible? Simply
put, comparing figures of one year to another simply fails to understand
the dynamics at work, such as the impact of *"reasons of state"* and
working class resistance to Bolshevik rule. It, in effect, turns the
attention away from the state of working class autonomy and onto number
crunching.

Ultimately, the question of whether the working class was too
*"atomised"* to govern can only be answered by looking at the class
struggle in Russia during this period, by looking at the strikes,
demonstrations and protests that occurred. Something Leninists rarely
do. Needless to say, certain strike waves just cannot be ignored. The
most obvious case is in Petrograd just before the Kronstadt revolt in
early 1921. After all, the strikes (and subsequent Bolshevik repression)
inspired the sailors to revolt in solidarity with them. Faced with such
events, the scale of the protest and Bolshevik repression is understated
and the subject quickly changed. As we noted in [section
10](append42.html#app10) of the appendix on ["What was the Kronstadt
Rebellion?"](append42.html), John Rees states that Kronstadt was
*"preceded by a wave of serious but quickly resolved strikes."* [Rees,
**Op. Cit.**, p. 61] Needless to say, he does not mention that the
strikes were *"resolved"* by *"serious"* force. Nor does he explain how
*"an atomised, individualised mass"* **could** conduct such *"serious"*
strikes, strikes which required martial law to break. Little wonder,
then, Rees does expound on the strikes and what they meant in terms of
the revolution and his own argument.

Similarly, we find Victor Serge arguing that the *"working class often
fretted and cursed; sometimes it lent an ear to the Menshevik agitators,
as in the great strikes at Petrograd in the spring of 1919. But once the
choice was posed as that between the dictatorship of the White Generals
and the dictatorship of its own party -- and there was not and could not
be any other choice -- every fit man . . . came to stand . . . before
the windows of the local party offices."* [**Year One of the Russian
Revolution**, pp. 365-6] An exhausted and atomised working class capable
of *"great strikes"*? That seems unlikely. Significantly, Serge does not
mention the Bolshevik acts of repression used against the rebel workers
(see below). This omission cannot help distort any conclusions to be
drawn from his account.

Which, incidentally, shows that the civil war was not all bad news for
the Bolsheviks. Faced with working class protest, they could play the
*"White card"* -- unless the workers went back to work, the Whites would
win. This explains why the strikes of early 1921 were larger than before
and explains why they were so important. As the *"White card"* could no
longer be played, the Bolshevik repression could not be excused in terms
of the civil war. Indeed, given working class opposition to the party,
it would be fair to say that civil war actually **helped** the
Bolsheviks remain in power. Without the threat of the Whites, the
working class would **not** have tolerated the Bolsheviks longer than
the Autumn of 1918.

The fact is that working class collective struggle against the new
regime and, consequently, Bolshevik repression, started before the
outbreak of the civil war. It continued throughout the civil war period
and reached a climax in the early months of 1921. Even the repression of
the Kronstadt rebellion did not stop it, with strikes continuing into
1923 (and, to a lesser degree, afterward). Indeed, the history of the
*"workers' state"* is a history of the state repressing the revolt of
the workers.

Needless to say, it would be impossible to give a full account of
working class resistance to Bolshevism. All we can do here is give a
flavour of what was happening and the sources for further information.
What should be clear from our account is that the idea that the working
class in this period was incapable of collective organisation and
struggle is false. As such, the idea that Bolshevik *"substitutionism"*
can be explained in such term is also false. In addition, it will become
clear that Bolshevik repression explicitly aimed to break the ability of
workers to organise and exercise collective power. As such, it seems
hypocritical for modern-day Leninists to blame Bolshevik power on the
*"atomisation"* of the working class when Bolshevik power was dependent
on smashing working class collective organisation and resistance. Simply
put, to remain in power Bolshevism, from the start, had to crush working
class power. This is to be expected, given the centralised nature of the
state and the assumptions of vanguardism. If you like, October 1917 did
not see the end of *"dual power."* Rather the Bolshevik state replaced
the bourgeois state and working class power (as expressed in its
collective struggle) came into conflict with it.

This struggle of the *"workers' state"* against the workers started
early in 1918. *"By the early summer of 1918,"* records one historian,
*"there were widespread anti-Bolshevik protests. Armed clashes occurred
in the factory districts of Petrograd and other industrial centres.
Under the aegis of the Conference of Factory and Plant Representatives .
. . a general strike was set for July 2."* [William Rosenberg, *"Russian
labour and Bolshevik Power,"* pp. 98-131, **The Workers' revolution in
Russia**, 1917, Daniel H. Kaiser (ed.), p. 107] According to another
historian, economic factors *"were soon to erode the standing of the
Bolsheviks among Petrograd workers . . . These developments, in turn,
led in short order to worker protests, which then precipitated violent
repressions against hostile workers. Such treatment further intensified
the disenchantment of significant segments of Petrograd labour with
Bolshevik-dominated Soviet rule."* [Alexander Rabinowitch, **Early
Disenchantment with Bolshevik Rule**, p. 37]

The reasons for these protest movement were both political and economic.
The deepening economic crisis combined with protests against Bolshevik
authoritarianism to produce a wave of strikes aiming for political
change. Feeling that the soviets were distant and unresponsive to their
needs (with good reason, given Bolshevik postponement of soviet
elections and gerrymandering of the soviets), workers turned to direct
action and the initially Menshevik inspired *"Conference of Factory and
Plant Representatives"* (also known as the *"Extraordinary Assembly of
Delegates from Petrograd Factories and Plants"*) to voice their
concerns. At its peak, reports *"estimated that out of 146,000 workers
still in Petrograd, as many as 100,000 supported the conference's
goals."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 127] The aim of the Conference (as per
Menshevik policy) was to reform the existing system *"from within"* and,
as such, the Conference operated openly. As Alexander Rabinowitch notes,
*"[F]or the Soviet authorities in Petrograd, the rise of the
Extraordinary Assembly of Delegates from Petrograd Factories and Plants
was an ominous portent of worker defection."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 37]

The first wave of outrage and protests occurred after Bolshevik Red
Guards opened fire on a demonstration for the Constituent Assembly in
early January (killing 21, according to Bolshevik sources). This
demonstration *"was notable as the first time workers came out actively
against the new regime. More ominously, it was also the first time
forces representing soviet power used violence against workers."* [David
Mandel, **The Petrograd Workers and the Soviet Seizure of Power**, p.
355] It would not be the last -- indeed repression by the *"workers'
state"* of working class protest became a recurring feature of
Bolshevism.

By April *"it appeared that the government was now ready to go to
whatever extremes it deemed necessary (including sanctioning the arrest
and even shooting of workers) to quell labour unrest. This in turn led
to intimidation, apathy, lethargy and passivity of other workers. In
these circumstances, growth in support of the Assembly slowed down."*
[Rabinowitch, **Op. Cit.**, p. 40] The Assembly aborted its plans for a
May Day demonstration to protest the government's policies were
cancelled because of workers did not respond to the appeals to
demonstrate (in part because of *"Bolshevik threats against
'protesters'"* [**Op. Cit.**, pp. 40-1]).

This apathy did not last long. After early May events *"served to
reinvigorate and temporarily radicalise the Assembly. These developments
included yet another drastic drop in food supplies, the shooting of
protesting housewives and workers in the Petrograd suburb of Kolpino,
the arbitrary arrest and abuse of workers in another Petrograd suburb,
Sestroresk, the closure of newspapers and the arrests of individuals who
had denounced the Kolpino and Sestroresk events, the intensification of
labour unrest and conflict with the authorities in the Obukhov plant and
in other Petrograd factories and districts."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 41]

So the next major protest wave occurred in early May, 1918, after armed
guards opened fire on protesting workers in Kolpino -- *"while the
incident was hardly the first of its kind, it triggered a massive wave
of indignation."* Work temporarily stopped in a number of plants.
Between Kolpino and early July, more than seventy incidents occurred in
Petrograd, including strikes, demonstrations and anti-Bolshevik
meetings. Many of these meetings *"were protests against some form of
Bolshevik repression: shootings, incidents of 'terroristic activities,'
and arrests."* In some forty incidents *"worker's protests focused on
these issues, and the data is surely understate the actual number by a
wide margin. There were as well some eighteen separate strikes or some
other work stoppages with an explicitly anti-Bolshevik character."*
[Rosenberg, **Op. Cit.**, p. 123 and pp. 123-4] Then, *"[a]t the very
end of May and the beginning of June, when a wave of strikes to protest
at bread shortages broke out in the Nevskii district, a majority of
Assembly delegates . . . resolved to call on striking Nevskii district
workers to return to work and continue preparation for a general
city-wide strike."* [Rabinowitch, **Op. Cit.**, p. 42] Unfortunately,
for the Assembly postponing the strikes until a *"better time"* rather
than encouraging them gave the authorities time to prepare.

Things came to a head during and after the soviet elections in June. On
June 20th the Obukhov works issued an appeal to the Conference of
Factory and Plant Representatives *"to declare a one-day strike of
protest on June 25th"* against Bolshevik reprisals for the assassination
of a leading Bolshevik. *"The Bolsheviks responded by 'invading' the
whole Nevskii district with troops and shutting down Obukhov completely.
Meetings everywhere were forbidden."* The workers were not intimidated
and *"[i]n scores of additional factories and shops protests mounted and
rapidly spread along the railroads."* At the June 26th *"extraordinary
session"* of the Conference a general strike was declared for July 2nd.
Faced with this, the Bolsheviks set up *"machine guns . . . at main
points throughout the Petrograd and Moscow railroad junctions, and
elsewhere in both cities as well. Controls were tightened in factories.
Meetings were forcefully dispersed."* [Rosenberg, **Op. Cit.**, pp.
126-7 and p. 127] In other words, *"as a result of extreme government
intimidation, the response to the Assembly's strike call on 2 July was
negligible."* [Rabinowitch, **Op. Cit.**, p. 42] This repression was not
trivial:

> *"Among other things, all newspapers were forced to print on their
> front pages Petrograd soviet resolutions condemning the Assembly as
> part of the domestic and foreign counter-revolution. Factories
> participating in the strike were warned that they would be shut down
> and individual strikers were threatened with the loss of work --
> threats that were subsequently made good. Printing plants suspected of
> opposition sympathies were sealed, the offices of hostile trade unions
> were raided, martial law declared on rail lines, and armed
> strike-breaking patrols with authority to take whatever action was
> necessary to prevent work stoppages were formed and put on 24-hour
> duty at key points throughout Petrograd."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 45]

Needless to say, *"the Petrograd authorities drew on the dubious mandate
provided by the stacked soviet elections to justify banning the
Extraordinary Assembly."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 42] While the Bolsheviks had
won around 50% of workplace votes, as we note in [section
6](append41.html#app6) of the appendix on ["What happened during the
Russian Revolution?"](append41.html) they had gerrymandered the soviet
making the election results irrelevant. The fact the civil war had
started undoubtedly aided the Bolsheviks during this election and the
fact that the Mensheviks and SRs had campaigned on a platform to win the
soviet elections as the means of replacing soviet democracy by the
Constituent Assembly. Many workers still viewed the soviets are
**their** organisations and aimed for a functioning soviet system rather
than its end.

The Bolsheviks turned on the Conference, both locally and nationally,
and arrested its leading activists, so decapitating the only independent
working class organisation left in Russia. As Rabinowitch argues, *"the
Soviet authorities were profoundly worried by the threat posed by the
Assembly and fully aware if their growing isolation from workers (their
only real social base) . . . Petrograd Bolsheviks developed a siege
mentality and a corresponding disposition to consider any action -- from
suppression of the opposition press and manipulation of elections to
terror even against workers -- to be justified in the struggle to retain
power until the start of the imminent world revolution."* [**Op. Cit.**,
pp. 43-4]

Similar events happened in other cities. As we discuss in [section
6](append41.html#app6) of the appendix on ["What happened during the
Russian Revolution?"](append41.html), the Bolsheviks had disbanded
soviets elected with non-Bolshevik majorities all across Russia and
suppressed the resulting working class protest. In Moscow, workers also
organised a *"Conference"* movement and *"[r]esentment against the
Bolsheviks was expressed through strikes and disturbances, which the
authorities treated as arising from supply difficulties, from 'lack of
consciousness,' and because of the 'criminal demagogy' of certain
elements. Lack of support for current Bolshevik practices was treated as
the absence of worker consciousness altogether, but the causes of the
unrest was more complicated. In 1917 political issues gradually came to
be perceived through the lens of party affiliation, but by mid-1918
party consciousness was reversed and a general consciousness of workers'
needs restored. By July 1918 the protest movement had lost its momentum
in the face of severe repression and was engulfed by the civil war."* In
the light of the fate of workers' protest, the May 16th resolution by
the Bogatyr' Chemical Plant calling (among other things) for *"freedom
of speech and meeting, and an end to the shooting of citizens and
workers"* seems to the point. Unsurprisingly, *"[f]aced with political
opposition within the soviets and worker dissatisfaction in the
factories Bolshevik power increasingly came to reply on the party
apparatus itself."* [Richard Sakwa, *"The Commune State in Moscow in
1918,"* pp. 429-449, **Slavic Review**, vol. 46, no. 3/4, p. 442-3, p.
442 and p. 443]

Repression occurred elsewhere: *"In June 1918 workers in Tula protested
a cut in rations by boycotting the local soviet. The regime declared
martial law and arrested the protestors. Strikes followed and were
suppressed by violence. In Sormovo, when a Menshevik-Social
Revolutionary newspaper was closed, 5,000 workers went on strike. Again
firearms were used to break the strike."* Other techniques were used to
break resistance. For example, the regime often threatened rebellious
factories with a lock out, which involved numerous layouts, new rules of
discipline, purges of workers' organisations and the introduction of
piece work. [Thomas F. Remington, **Building Socialism in Bolshevik
Russia**, p. 105 and p. 107]

Rather than the Civil War disrupting the relationship between the
vanguard party and the class it claimed to lead, it was in fact the
Bolsheviks who did so in face of rising working class dissent and
disillusionment in the spring of 1918. In fact, *"after the initial
weeks of 'triumph' . . . Bolshevik labour relations after October"*
changed and *"soon lead to open conflict, repression, and the
consolidation of Bolshevik dictatorship over the proletariat in place of
proletarian dictatorship itself."* [Rosenberg, **Op. Cit.**, p. 117]

Given this, the outbreak of the civil war consolidated workers support
for the Bolsheviks and saved it from even more damaging workers' unrest.
As Thomas F. Remington puts it:

> *"At various times groups of workers rebelled against Bolshevik rule
> But for the most part, forced to choose between 'their' regime and the
> unknown horrors of a White dictatorship, most willingly defended the
> Bolshevik cause. The effect of this dilemma may be seen in the
> periodic swings in the workers' political temper. When Soviet rule
> stood in peril, the war simulated a spirit of solidarity and spared
> the regime the defection of its proletarian base. During lulls in the
> fighting, strikes and demonstrations broke out."* [**Op. Cit.**, p.
> 101]

Which, as we will discuss, explains the increased repression in 1921 and
onwards. Without the Whites, the Bolsheviks had to enforce their rule
directly onto workers who did not want it. Ironically, the Whites
**helped** the Bolsheviks remain in power. Without the start of the
civil war, labour protest would have either ended Bolshevik rule or
exposed it as a dictatorial regime.

This process of workers protest and state repression continued in 1919
and subsequent years. It followed a cyclical pattern. There was a *"new
outbreak of strikes in March 1919 after the collapse of Germany and the
Bolshevik re-conquest of the Ukraine. The pattern of repression was also
repeated. A strike at a galosh factory in early 1919 was followed by the
closing of the factory, the firing of a number of workers, and the
supervised re-election of its factory committee. The Soviet garrison at
Astrakhan mutinied after its bread ration was cut. A strike among the
city's workers followed in support. A meeting of 10,000 Astrakhan
workers was suddenly surrounded by loyal troops, who fired on the crowd
with machine guns and hand grenades, killing 2,000. Another 2,000, taken
prisoner, were subsequently executed. In Tula, when strikes at the
defence factories stopped production for five days, the government
responded by distributing more grain and arresting the strike organisers
. . . strikes at Putilov again broke out, at first related to the food
crisis . . . The government treated the strike as an act of
counter-revolution and responded with a substantial political purge and
re-organisation. An official investigation . . . concluded that many
shop committees were led by [Left] Social Revolutionaries . . . These
committees were abolished and management representatives were appointed
in their stead."* [Remington, **Op. Cit.**, pp. 109-10]

The strikes in Petrograd centred around the Putilov shows the response
of the authorities to the *"atomised"* workers who were taking
collective action. *"In March fifteen factories struck together (roughly
35,000 workers were involved) . . . workers at Putilov assembled and
sent a delegation to the works committee . . .and put forward a number
of demands . . . On 12 March Putilov stopped work. Its workers called to
others to join them, and some of them came out in a demonstration where
they were fired upon by Cheka troops. Strikes then broke out at fourteen
other enterprises . . . On Sunday 16 March an appeal was made to the
Putilovtsy to return to normal working the following day or . . . the
sailors and soldiers would be brought in. After a poor showing on the
Monday, the sailor went in, and 120 workers were arrested; the sailors
remained until the 21st and by the 22nd normal work had been resumed."*
In July strikes broke out again in response to the cancellation of
holidays which involved 25,000 workers in 31 strikes. [Mary McAuley,
**Bread and Justice**, pp. 251-253 and p. 254]

In the Moscow area, while it is *"impossible to say what proportion of
workers were involved in the various disturbances,"* following the lull
after the defeat of the workers' conference movement in mid-1918 *"each
wave of unrest was more powerful than the last, culminating in the mass
movement from late 1920."* For example, at the end of June 1919, *"a
Moscow committee of defence (KOM) was formed to deal with the rising
tide of disturbances . . . KOM concentrated emergency power in its
hands, overriding the Moscow Soviet, and demanding obedience from the
population. The disturbances died down under the pressure of
repression."* [Richard Sakwa, **Soviet Communists in Power**, p. 94 and
pp. 94-5]

Vladimir Brovkin summarises the data he provides in his essay *"Workers'
Unrest and the Bolshevik Response in 1919"* (reproduced along with data
from other years in his book **Behind the Front Lines of the Civil
War**) as follows:

> *"Data on one strike in one city may be dismissed as incidental. When,
> however, evidence is available from various sources on simultaneous
> independent strikes in different cities and overall picture begins to

> Review**, vol. 49, no. 3, pp. 370-2]

Nor was this collective struggle stop in 1919 -- *"strike action
remained endemic in the first nine months of 1920"* and *"in the first
six months of 1920 strikes had occurred in seventy-seven per cent of
middle-sized and large works."* For the Petrograd province, soviet
figures state that in 1919 there were 52 strikes with 65,625
participants and in 1920 73 strikes with 85,645, both high figures as
according to one set of figures, which are by no means the lowest, there
were 109,100 workers there. *"Strikes in 1920,"* recounts Aves, *"were
frequently a direct protest against the intensification of War Communist
labour policies, the militarisation of labour, the implementation of
one-man management and the struggle against absenteeism, as well as food
supply difficulties. The Communist Party press carried numerous articles
attacking the slogan of 'free labour.'"* [J. Aves, **Workers Against
Lenin**, p. 69 and p. 74]

The spring of 1920 *"saw discontent on the railways all over the
country."* This continued throughout the year. For example, the
Aleksansrovskii locomotive works at the end of August, workers sent
three representatives to the works commissar who had them arrested.
Three days later, the workers stopped work and demanded their release.
The authorities locked the workers out of the works and a guard of 70
sailors were placed outside the enterprise. The Cheka arrested the
workers' soviet delegates (who were from the SR (Minority) list) as well
as thirty workers. *"The opportunity was taken to carry out a general
round-up"* and arrests were made at other works. After the arrests, *"a
meeting was held to elect new soviet delegates but the workers refused
to co-operate and a further 150 were arrested and exiled to Murmansk or
transferred to other workshops."* [Aves, **Op. Cit.**, p. 44 and pp.
46-7]

Strikes occurred in other places, such as Tula were the workforce
*"contained a high proportion of skilled, long-standing, hereditary
workers."* The *"all-out strike"* started at the start of June and on 8
June the local newspaper published a declaration from the Tula soviet
threatening the strikers with *"the most repressive measures, including
the application of the highest measure of punishment"* (i.e.
executions). The following day the city was declared to be under a
*"state of siege"* by the local military authorities. The strikers lost
ration cards and by 11 June there had been a return to work.
Twenty-three workers were sentenced to a forced labour camp until the
end of the war. However, the *"combined impact of these measures did not
prevent further unrest and the workers put forward new demands."* On 19
June, the soviet approved *"a programme for the suppression of
counter-revolution"* and *"the transfer of Tula to the position of an
armed camp."* The Tula strike *"highlights the way in which workers,
particularly skilled workers who were products of long-standing
shop-floor subcultures and hierarchies, retained the capability as well
as the will to defend their interests."* [Aves, **Op. Cit.**, p. 50-55]

While strike activity *"was most common in Petrograd, where there had
been 2.5 strikers for every workman,"* the figure for Moscow was 1.75
and 1.5 in Kazan. In early March *"a wave of strikes hit the Volga town
of Samara"* when a strike by printers in spread to other enterprises.
*"Strike action in Moscow did not just include traditionally militant
male metal workers."* Textile workers, tram workers and printers all
took strike action. [Aves, **Op. Cit.**, p. 69, p. 72 and pp. 77-8]

Thus strike action was a constant feature of civil war Bolshevik Russia.
Rather than being an *"atomised"* mass, the workers repeatedly organised
themselves, made their demands and took collective action to achieve
them. In response, the Bolshevik regime used state repression to break
this collective activity. As such, **if** the rise of Stalinism can, as
modern-day Leninists argue, be explained by the *"atomisation"* of the
working class during the civil war then the Bolshevik regime and its
repression should be credited with ensuring this happened.

The end of the civil war did not see the end of working class protest.
Quite the reverse. In February and March 1921 *"industrial unrest broke
out in a nation-wide wave of discontent . . . General strikes, or very
widespread unrest, hit Petrograd, Moscow, Saratov and Ekaterinoslavl."*
Only one major industrial region was unaffected. As noted above, the
Bolsheviks refused to call this movement a strike wave, preferring the
term **volynka** (which means "go-slow"), yet *"the continued use of the
term can be justified not to hide its significance but to show that
workers' protest consisted not just of strikes but also of factory
occupations, 'Italian strikes,' demonstrations, mass meetings, the
beating up of communists and so on."* [Aves, **Op. Cit.**, p. 109 and p.
112]

In Petrograd in the beginning of February *"strikes were becoming an
everyday occurrence"* and by *"the third week of February the situation
rapidly deteriorated."* The city was rocked by strikes, meetings and
demonstrations. In response to the general strike the Bolsheviks replied
with a *"military clamp-down, mass arrests and other coercive measures,
such as the closure of enterprises, the purging of the workforce and
stopping of rations which accompanied them."* As we discuss in ["What
was the Kronstadt Rebellion?"](append42.html), these strikes produced
the Kronstadt revolt (and, as noted in [section 10](append42.html#app10)
of that appendix, the Bolshevik repression ensured the Petrograd workers
did not act with the sailors). [Aves, **Op. Cit.**, p. 113, p. 120]

A similar process of workers revolt and state repression occurred in
Moscow at the same time. There *"industrial unrest"* also *"turned into
open confrontation and protest spilled on to the streets."* Meetings
were held, followed by demonstrations and strikes. Over the next few
days strikes spread to other districts. Workers demanded now elections
to the soviets be held. Striking railway workers sent emissaries along
the railway to spread the strike and strikes spread to outside Moscow
city itself and into the surrounding provinces. Unsurprisingly, Moscow
and Moscow province were put under martial law and SR and menshevik
leaders were arrested. [Aves, **Op. Cit.**, p. 130 pp. 139-144] However,
*"military units called in"* against striking workers *"refused to open
fire, and they were replaced by the armed communist detachments"* who
did. *"The following day several factories went on strike"* and troops
*"disarmed and locked in as a precaution"* by the government against
possible fraternising. On February 23rd, *"Moscow was placed under
martial law with a 24-hour watch on factories by the communist
detachments and trustworthy army units."* [Richard Sakwa, **Soviet
Communists in Power**, p. 94 and pp. 94-5 and p. 245] The mixture of
(economic) concessions and coercion broke the will of the strikers.

Strikes and protests occurred all across Russia at this time (see Aves,
**Op. Cit.**). In Saratov, the strike started on March 3 when railroad
shop workers did not return to their benches and instead rallied to
discuss an anticipated further reduction in food rations. *"Led by a
former Communist, the railroad workers debated resolutions recently
carried by the Moscow proletariat . . . The next day the strike spread
to the metallurgical plants and to most other large factories, as
Saratov workers elected representatives to an independent commission
charged with evaluating the functioning of all economic organs. When it
convened, the body called for the re-election of the soviets and
immediate release of political prisoners."* The ration cut
*"represent[ed] the catalyst, but not the cause, of the labour unrest."*
While *"the turmoil touched all strata of the proletariat, male and
female alike, the initiative for the disturbances came from the skilled
stratum that the Communists normally deemed the most conscious."* The
Communists shut down the commission and they *"expected workers to
protest the dissolution of their elected representatives"* and so they
*"set up a Provincial Revolutionary Committee . . . which introduced
martial law both in the city and the garrison. It arrested the
ringleaders of the workers' movement . . . the police crackdown
depressed the workers' movement and the activities of the rival
socialist parties."* The Cheka sentenced 219 people to death. [Donald J.
Raleigh, **Experiencing Russia's Civil War**, p. 379, p. 387, p. 388,
pp. 388-9]

A similar *"little Kronstadt"* broke out in the Ukrainian town of
Ekaterinoslavl at the end of May. The workers there *"clearly had strong
traditions of organisation"* and elected a strike committee of fifteen
which *"put out a series of political ultimatums that were very similar
in content to the demands of the Kronstadt rebels."* On 1 June, *"by a
pre-arranged signal"* workers went on strike throughout the town, with
workers joining a meeting of the railway workers. The local Communist
Party leader was instructed *"to put down the rebellion without mercy .
. . Use Budennyi's cavalry."* The strikers prepared a train and its
driver instructed to spread the strike throughout the network. Telegraph
operators were told to send messages throughout the Soviet Republic
calling for *"free soviets"* and soon an area up to fifty miles around
the town was affected. The Communists used the Cheka to crush the
movement, carrying out mass arrests and shooting 15 workers (and dumping
their bodies in the River Dnepr). [Aves, **Op. Cit.**, pp. 171-3]

So faced with an *"atomised"* working class during the period of 1918
and 1921, the Bolsheviks had to respond with martial law, mass arrests
and shootings:

> *"It is not possible to estimate with any degree of accuracy how many
> workers were shot by the Cheka during 1918-1921 for participation in
> labour protest. However, an examination of individual cases suggests
> that shootings were employed to inspire terror and were not simply
> used in the occasional extreme case."* [Aves, **Op. Cit.**, p. 35]

Post-Kronstadt, similar Bolshevik responses to labour unrest continued.
The economic crisis of 1921 which accompanied the introduction of the
NEP saw unemployment rise yet *"[d]espite the heavy toll of
redundancies, the ability to organise strikes did not disappear. Strike
statistics for 1921 continue to provide only a very rough indicator of
the true scale of industrial unrest and appear not to include the first
half of the year."* The spring of 1922 saw Soviet Russia *"hit by a new
strike wave"* and the strikes *"continued to reflect enterprise
traditions."* That year saw 538 strikes with 197,022 participants
recorded. [Aves, **Op. Cit.**, p. 183 and p. 184]

The following year saw more strikes: *"In July 1923 more than 100
enterprises employing a total of some 50,000 people were on strike. In
August figures totalled some 140 enterprises and 80,00 workers. In
September and November the strike wave continued unabated."* As in the
civil war, the managers shut down plants, fired the workers and rehired
them on an individual basis. In this way, trouble-makers were dismissed
and *"order"* restored. *"The pattern of workers' action and Bolshevik
reaction played itself out frequently in dozens of other strikes. The
Bolsheviks acted with the explicit purpose of rooting out the
possibility of further protest. They tried to condition workers that
labour protest was futile."* The GPU *"used force to disperse workers
demonstrating with the arrested strike leaders."* [Vladimir Brovkin,
**Russia After Lenin**, p. 174, pp. 174-5 and p. 175]

In Moscow, for example, *"[b]etween 1921 and 1926, all branches of
industry and transport . . . experienced wildcat strikes or other
spontaneous labour disturbances. Strike waves peaked in the winter of
1920-21 . . . and in the summer and fall of 1922 and 1923 . . . during
July-December 1922, for example, 65 strikes and 209 other industrial
disturbances were recorded in Moscow's state enterprises."* Metalworkers
were arguably the most active sector at this time while *"a number of
large strikes"* took place in the textile industry (where *"strikes were
sometimes co-ordinated by spontaneously organised strike committees or
'parallel' factory committees"*). And in spite of repression,
*"politicisation continued to characterise many labour struggles"* and,
as before, *"spontaneous labour activism hindered not only the party's
economic program but also the political and social stabilisation of the
factories."* [John B. Hatch, **Labour Conflict in Moscow, 1921-1925**,
p. 62, p. 63, p. 65, pp. 66-7 and p. 67]

Given this collective rebellion all across the industrial centres of
Russia throughout the Civil War and after, it hard to take seriously
claims that Bolshevik authoritarian was the product of an
*"atomisation"* or *"declassing"* of the working class or that it had
ceased to exist in any meaningful sense. Clearly it had and was capable
of collective action and organisation -- until it was repressed by the
Bolsheviks and even then it keep returning. This implies that a key
factor in rise of Bolshevik authoritarian was political -- the simple
fact that the workers would not vote Bolshevik in free soviet and union
elections and so they were not allowed to. As one Soviet Historian put
it, *"taking the account of the mood of the workers, the demand for free
elections to the soviets [raised in early 1921] meant the implementation
in practice of the infamous slogan of soviets without communists,"*
although there is little evidence that the strikers actually raised that
*"infamous"* slogan. [quoted by Aves, **Op. Cit.**, p. 123] It should
also be noted that Bolshevik orthodoxy at the time stressed the
necessity of Party dictatorship **over** the workers (see [section
H.1.2](secH1.html#sech12) for details).

Nor can it be said that this struggle can be blamed on *"declassed"*
elements within the working class itself. In her study of this question,
Diane Koenker notes that 90% of the change in the number of workers in
Moscow *"is accounted for by men. Working women did not leave the
city,"* their numbers dropping from 90,000 in 1918 to 80,000 in 1920.
Why these 80,000 women workers should be denied a say in their own
revolution is not clear, given the arguments of the pro-Bolshevik left.
After all, the same workers remained in roughly the same numbers.
Looking at the male worker population, their numbers fell from 215,000
to 124,000 during the same period. However, *"the skilled workers whose
class consciousness and revolutionary zeal had helped win the October
revolution did not entirely disappear, and the women who remained were
likely to be family members of these veterans of 1917."* It was *"the
loss of young activists rather than all skilled and class conscious
urban workers that caused the level of Bolshevik support to decline
during the civil war."* Indeed *"the workers who remained in the city
were among the most urbanised elements."* In summary, *"the
deurbanisation of those years represented a change in quantity but not
entirely in quality in the cities. The proletariat declined in the city,
but it did not wither away . . . a core of the city's working class
remained."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 440, p. 442, p. 447 and p. 449]

As Russian anarchist Ida Mett argued decades before in relation to the
strikes in early 1921:

> *"The population was drifting away from the capital. All who had
> relatives in the country had rejoined them. The authentic proletariat
> remained till the end, having the most slender connections with the
> countryside.*
>
> "This fact must be emphasised, in order to nail the official lies
> seeking to attribute the Petrograd strikes that were soon to break out
> to peasant elements, 'insufficiently steeled in proletarian ideas.'
> The real situation was the very opposite. A few workers were seeking
> refuge in the countryside. The bulk remained. There was certainly no
> exodus of peasants into the starving towns! . . . It was the famous
> Petrograd proletariat, the proletariat which had played such a leading
> role in both previous revolutions, that was finally to resort to the
> classical weapon of the class struggle: the strike." [**The Kronstadt
> Uprising**, p. 36]

In terms of struggle, links between the events in 1917 and those during
the civil war also exist. For example Jonathan Aves writes that there
were *"distinct elements of continuity between the industrial unrest in
1920 and 1917. This is not surprising since the form of industrial
unrest in 1920, as in the pre-revolutionary period and in 1917, was
closely bound up with enterprise traditions and shop-floor sub-cultures.
The size of the Russian industrial workforce had declined steeply during
the Civil War but where enterprises stayed open . . . their traditions
of industrial unrest in 1920 shows that such sub-cultures were still
capable of providing the leaders and shared values on which resistance
to labour policies based on coercion and Communist Party enthusiasm
could be organised. As might be anticipated, the leaders of unrest were
often to be found amongst the skilled male workers who enjoyed positions
of authority in the informal shop-floor hierarchies."* Moreover,
*"despite intense repression, small groups of politicised activists were
also important in initiating protest and some enterprises developed
traditions of opposition to the communists."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 39]

Looking at the strike wave of early 1921 in Petrograd, the *"strongest
reason for accepting the idea that it was established workers who were
behind the **volynka** [i.e. the strike wave] is the form and course of
protest. Traditions of protest reaching back through the spring of 1918
to 1917 and beyond were an important factor in the organisation of the
**volynka.** . . . There was also a degree of organisation . . . which
belies the impression of a spontaneous outburst."* [Aves, **Op. Cit.**,
p. 126]

Clearly, then, the idea that the Russian working class was atomised or
declassed cannot be defended given this series of struggles and state
repression. In fact, as noted, the notion that the workers were
*"declassed"* was used to justify state repression of collective working
class struggle. *"The thought oppressed me,"* wrote Emma Goldman, *"that
what [the Bolsheviks] called 'defence of the Revolution' was really only
the defence of [their] party in power."* [**My Disillusionment in
Russia**, p. 57] She was right -- the class struggle in Bolshevik Russia
did not stop, it continued except the ruling class had changed from
bourgeoisie to Bolshevik dictatorship.

Faced with this collective resistance to Bolshevism, the Leninist could
argue that while the working class was capable of collective decision
making and action, the nature of that action was suspect. This arguments
rests on the premise that the *"advanced"* workers (i.e. party members)
left the workplace for the front or for government posts, leaving the
*"backward"* workers behind. This argument is often used, particularly
in regard to the Kronstadt revolt of 1921 (see [section
8](append42.html#app8) of the appendix on ["What was the Kronstadt
Rebellion?"](append42.html)).

Of course, this argument raises more problems that its solves. In
**any** revolution the *"most politically consciousness"* tend to
volunteer to go to the front first and, of course, tend to be elected as
delegates to committees of various kinds (local, regional and national).
There is little that can be done about it. Needless to say, if *"soviet
democracy"* depends on the *"advanced"* workers being there in order for
it to work, then it suggests that the commitment to democracy is lacking
in those who argue along these lines. It suggests that if the
*"backward"* masses reject the *"advanced"* ones then the latter have
the right, even the duty, to impose their will on the former. And it
also begs the question of who determines what constitutes *"backward"*
-- if it means *"does not support the party"* then it becomes little
more than a rationale for party dictatorship (as it did under Lenin and
Trotsky).

Writing in 1938, Trotsky inadvertently exposes the logic of this
position. Asserting that a *"revolution is 'made' directly by a
**minority**,"* he argued that the *"success"* of a revolution is
*"possible"* when *"this minority finds more or less support, or at
least friendly neutrality, on the part of the majority."* So what
happens if the majority expresses opposition to the party? Unfortunately
Trotsky does not raise this question, but he does answer it indirectly.
As we discuss in [section 15](append42.html#app15) of the appendix on
["What was the Kronstadt Rebellion?"](append42.html"), Trotsky argues
that *"to free the soviets from the leadership [sic!] of the Bolsheviks
would have meant within a short time to demolish the soviets themselves.
The experience of the Russian soviets during the period of Menshevik and
SR domination and, even more clearly, the experience of the German and
Austrian soviets under the domination of the Social Democrats, proved
this. Social Revolutionary-anarchist soviets could only serve as a
bridge from the proletarian dictatorship. They could play no other role,
regardless of the 'ideas' of their participants."* [Lenin and Trotsky,
**Kronstadt**, p. 85 and p. 90]

Thus to let the working masses (the *"majority"*) have free soviet
elections and reject the vanguard (the *"minority"*) would mean the end
of soviet power. Thus allowing the proletariat a say in progress of the
revolution means the end of the *"proletarian dictatorship"*! Which, of
course, is interesting logic. The authoritarian core of the Bolshevik
vision of revolution is thus exposed.

Victor Serge also presents an insight into the Bolshevik perspective on
the revolution. He states that *"[a]gitation conducted by the SRs and
Mensheviks called demonstrations in the streets and prepared for a
general strike. The demands were: free trade, wage increases, payment of
wages one, two or three months in advance and 'democracy.' The intention
was to incite the working class itself against the revolution."* Which
only makes sense once you realise that by *"the revolution"* Serge
simply meant *"the Bolsheviks"* and the obvious truth that the working
class was **not** managing the revolution at all, was **not,** in any
sense, "in power." *"The best elements among the workers,"* explains
Serge, *"were away fighting; those in the factories were precisely the
less energetic, less revolutionary sections, along with the petty folk,
yesterday's small shopkeepers and artisans, who had come there to find
refuge. This proletariat of the reserve often allowed itself to fall
under the sway of Menshevik propaganda."* [**Year One of the Russian
Revolution**, p. 229]

Given that Serge is discussing the period **before** the Czechoslovak
revolt, a greater indictment of Bolshevism cannot be found. After all,
what does *"workers' democracy"* mean unless the proletariat can vote
for its own delegates? Little wonder Daniel Guerin described Serge's
book as *"largely a justification of the liquidation of the soviets by
Bolshevism."* [**Anarchism**, p. 97] After all, what point is there
having genuine soviet elections if the *"less revolutionary sections"*
(i.e. Trotsky's *"majority"*) will not vote for the vanguard? And can
socialism exist without democracy? Can we expect an unaccountable
vanguard to govern in the interests of anyone but its own? Of course
not!

Thus the Bolsheviks did not solve the answer the questions Malatesta
raised in 1891, namely *"if you consider these worthy electors as unable
to look after their own interests themselves, how is it that they will
know how to choose for themselves the shepherds who must guide them? And
how will they be able to solve this problem of social alchemy, of
producing the election of a genius from the votes of a mass of fools?"*
[**Anarchy**, p. 53]

Given this, is it surprising that the Bolsheviks revised the Marxist
theory of the state to justify elite rule? As discussed in [section
H.3.8](secH3.html#sech38), once in power Lenin and Trotsky stressed that
the "workers' state" had to be independent of the working class in order
to overcome the *"wavering"* and *"vacillation of the masses
themselves."* Or, to quote Serge, the *"party of the proletariat must
know, at hours of decision, how to break the resistance of the backward
elements among the masses; it must know how to stand firm sometimes
against the masses . . . it must know how to go against the current, and
cause proletarian consciousness to prevail against lack of consciousness
and against alien class influences."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 218] Of course,
by definition, **every** group is *"backward"* compared to the vanguard
and so Serge's argument amounts to little more than a justification for
party dictatorship **over** the proletariat.

The reason why such a system would not result in socialism does not take
long to discover. For anarchists, freedom is not just a goal, a noble
end to be achieved, but rather a necessary part of the process of
creating socialism. Eliminate freedom (and, as a necessary result,
workplace and community self-management) and the end result will be
anything **but** socialism. Ultimately, as Malatesta argued, *"the only
way that the masses can raise themselves"* is by freedom *"for it is
only through freedom that one educates oneself to be free."* [**Op.
Cit.**, p. 52] Ironically, by using state repression to combat
*"backward"* elements, the Bolsheviks ensured that they stayed that way
and, more importantly, disempowered the **whole** working class so
ensuring that Bolshevik dictatorship came into constant conflict with it
and its continuing struggle for autonomy. Rather than base itself on the
creative powers of the masses, Bolshevism crushed it as a threat to its
power and so ensured that the economic and social problems affecting
Russia increased.

And need it be pointed out that *"low"* culture and/or *"backward"*
social life have been used by numerous imperialist and authoritarian
states to justify their rule over a given population? It matters little
whether the population are of the same nationality of the rulers or from
a subjugated people, the arguments and the logic are the same. Whether
dressed up in racist or classist clothing, the same elitist pedigree
lies behind the pro-Bolshevik argument that democracy would have brought
*"chaos"* or *"capitalist restoration."* The implicit assumption that
working class people are not fit for self-government is clear from these
rationales. Equally obvious is the idea that the party knows better than
working class people what is best for them.

Sounding like Bolshevik Henry Kissingers, the Leninists argue that Lenin
and Trotsky had to enforce their dictatorship **over** the proletariat
to stop a *"capitalist restoration"* (Kissinger was the US state's
liaison with the Chilean military when it helped their coup in 1973 and
infamously stated that the country should not be allowed to turn
communist due to the stupidity of its own people). Needless to say,
anarchists argue that even if the Bolshevik regime had not already need
capitalist (specifically, **state** capitalist) this logic simply
represents an elitist position based on *"socialism from above."* Yes,
soviet democracy **may** have resulted in the return of (private)
capitalism but by maintaining party dictatorship the possibility of
socialism was automatically nullified. Simply put, the pro-Leninist
argument implies that socialism can be implemented from above as long as
the right people are in power. The authoritarian core of Leninism is
exposed by these arguments and the repression of working class revolt
which they justified.

Given this, it seems incredulous for Leninists like Chris Harman to
argue that it was the *"decimation of the working class"* which caused
(by *"necessity"*) the *"Soviet institutions"* to take *"on a life
independently of the class they had arisen from. Those workers and
peasants who fought the Civil War could not govern themselves
collectively from their places in the factories."* [**How the revolution
was lost**] Given that this *"independent"* life is required to allow
the party to *"go against the current,"* Harman simply fails to
understand the dynamics of the revolution, the position of the vanguard
and the resistance of the working class subject to it. Moreover, the
reason **why** the *"workers and peasants"* could not govern themselves
collectively was because the party had seized power for itself and
systematically destroyed soviet, workplace and military democracy to
remain there. Then there is the way the Bolsheviks reacted to such
collective unrest. Simply put, they sought to break the workers as a
collective force. The use of lockouts, re-registration was typical, as
was the arresting of *"ringleaders."* It seems ironic, therefore, to
blame *"objective factors"* for the *"atomisation"* of the working class
when, in fact, this was a key aim of Bolshevik repression of labour
protest.

Little wonder, then, that the role of the masses in the Russian
Revolution after October 1917 is rarely discussed by pro-Bolshevik
writers. Indeed, the conclusion to be reached is simply that their role
is to support the party, get it into power and then do what it tells
them. Unfortunately for the Bolsheviks, the Russian working class
refused to do this. Instead they practised collective struggle in
defence of their economic **and** political interests, struggle which
inevitably brought them into conflict both with the "workers' state" and
their role in Bolshevik ideology. Faced with this collective action, the
Bolshevik leaders (starting with Lenin) started to talk about the
*"declassing"* of the proletariat to justify their repression of (and
power **over**) the working class. Ironically, it was the aim of
Bolshevik repression to *"atomise"* the working class as, fundamentally,
their rule depended on it. While Bolshevik repression did, in the end,
win out it cannot be said that the working class in Russia did not
resist the usurpation of power by the Bolshevik party. As such, rather
than *"atomisation"* or *"declassing"* being the cause for Bolshevik
power and repression, it was, in fact, one of **results** of them.

6 Did the Bolsheviks blame *"objective factors"* for their actions?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

In a word, no. At the time of the revolution and for some period
afterwards, the idea that *"objective factors"* were responsible for
their policies was one which few, if any, Bolshevik leaders expressed.
As we discussed in [section 2](append43.html#app2), Bolsheviks like
Lenin, Trotsky and Bukharin argued that **any** revolution would face
civil war and economic crisis. Lenin **did** talk about the
*"declassing"* of the proletariat from 1920 onwards, but that did not
seem to affect the proletarian and socialist character of his regime (as
we noted in [section 5](append43.html#app5), Lenin's argument was
developed in the context of **increasing** working class collective
action, **not** its absence).

This is not to say that the Bolshevik leaders were 100% happy with the
state of their revolution. Lenin, for example, expressed concern about
the rising bureaucratic deformations he saw in the soviet state
(particularly after the end of the civil war). Yet Lenin, while
concerned about the bureaucracy, was not concerned about the Party's
monopoly of power. Unsurprisingly, he fought the bureaucracy by
"top-down" and, ironically, bureaucratic methods, the only ones left to
him. A similar position was held by Trotsky, who was quite explicit in
supporting the party dictatorship throughout the 1920s (and, indeed, the
1930s). Needless to say, both failed to understand how bureaucracy
arises and how it could be effectively fought.

This position started to change, however, as the 1920s drew on and
Trotsky was increasingly sidelined from power. Then, faced with the rise
of Stalinism, Trotsky had to find a theory which allowed him to explain
the degeneration of the revolution and, at the same time, absolve
Bolshevik ideology (and his own actions and ideas!) from all
responsibility for it. He did so by invoking the objective factors
facing the revolution. Since then, his various followers have utilised
this argument, with various changes in emphasis, to attack Stalinism
while defending Bolshevism.

The problem with this type of argument is that all the major evils
usually associated with Stalinism already existed under Lenin and
Trotsky. Party dictatorship, one-man management, repression of
opposition groups and working class protest, state bureaucracy and so on
all existed before Stalin manoeuvred himself into absolute power. And
with the exception of state bureaucracy, none of the mainstream
Bolshevik leaders found anything to complain about. Indeed, the reverse.
Whether it is Lenin or Trotsky, the sad fact of the matter is that a
party dictatorship presiding over an essentially state capitalism
economy was not considered a bad thing. Which, of course, causes
problems for those who seek to distance Lenin and Trotsky from Stalinism
and claim that Bolshevism is fundamentally *"democratic"* in nature.

The knots Leninists get into to do this can be ludicrous. A particularly
crazy example of this can be seen from the UK's Socialist Workers'
Party. For John Rees, it is a truism that *"it was overwhelmingly the
force of circumstance which obliged the Bolsheviks to retreat so far
from their own goals. They travelled this route in opposition to their
own theory, not because of it -- no matter what rhetorical
justifications were given at the time."* [*"In Defence of October,"* pp.
3-82, **International Socialism**, no. 52, p. 70]

However, this sort of position has little substance to it. It is both
logically and factually flawed. Logically, it simply makes little sense
as anything but an attempt to narrow political discussion and whitewash
Bolshevik practice and politics. Rees, in effect, is saying that not
only are we **not** to judge the Bolsheviks by their actions, we must
also discount what they said -- unless it was something modern day
Leninists approve of! Given that Leninists constantly quote from Lenin's
(and Trotsky's) post-1918 works, it seems strange that they try to stop
others so doing! Strange, but not surprising, given their task is to
perpetuate the Bolshevik Myth. Where that leaves revolutionary politics
is left unsaid, but it seems to involve worshipping at the shrine of
October and treating as a heretic anyone who dares suggest we analysis
it in any depth and perhaps learn lessons from it and the Bolshevism
that dominated it.

Of course Rees' comments are little more than assertions. Given that he
dismisses the idea that we can actually take what any Bolshevik says at
face value, we are left with little more than a mind reading operation
in trying to find out what the likes of Lenin and Trotsky *"really"*
thought. Perhaps the root explanation of Rees' position is the awkward
fact that there are no quotes from any of the leading Bolsheviks which
support it? After all, if they were quotes from the hallowed texts
expounding the position Rees says the Bolshevik leaders *"really"* held
then he would have provided them. The simple fact is that Lenin and
Trotsky, like all the Bolshevik leaders, considered a one-party
dictatorship ruling over a state capitalist economy as some form of
*"socialism."* That was certainly Trotsky's position and he was **not**
shy in expressing. But, of course, we can dismiss this simply as
*"rhetorical justifications"* rather than an expression of *"their own
theory"*! We will never know, as they never expressed *"their own
theory"* and instead made do with the *"rhetorical justifications"* Rees
is at such pains for us to ignore!

Which shows that a major problem in discussing the failure of the
Russian Revolution is the attitude of modern day Leninists. Rees
presents us with another example when he asserts that *"what is required
of historians, particularly Marxists, is to separate phrase from
substance."* The Bolsheviks, Rees argues, were *"inclined to make a
virtue of necessity, to claim that the harsh measures of the civil war
were the epitome of socialism."* Thus the Bolsheviks cannot be blamed
either for what they did or what they said. Indeed, he states that
non-Leninists *"take Lenin or Trotsky's shouts of command in the midst
of battle and portray them as considered analyses of events."* [**Op.
Cit.**, p. 46]

This argument is simply incredulous. After all, neither Lenin nor
Trotsky could be said to be anything **but** political activists who
took the time to consider events and analyse them in detail. Moreover,
they defended their arguments in terms of Marxism. Would Rees consider
Lenin's **State and Revolution** as an unimportant work? After all, this
was produced in the midst of the events of 1917, in often difficult
circumstances. If so, then why not his other, less appealing, political
proclamations (never mind actions)? Moreover, looking at some of the
works produced in this period it is clear that they are anything **but**
*"shouts of command in the midst of battle."* Trotsky's **Terrorism and
Communism** is a substantial book, for example It was not an ad hoc
comment made during a conference or *"in the midst of battle."* Quite
the reverse, it was a detailed, substantial and thought-out reply to the
criticism by the influential German social democrat Karl Kaustky (and,
before Lenin, the most internationally respected Marxist thinker).
Indeed, Trotsky explicitly asks the question *"[i]s there still
theoretical necessity to justify revolutionary terrorism?"* and answers
yes, his *"book must serve the ends of an irreconcilable struggle
against the cowardice, half-measures, and hypocrisy of Kautskianism in
all countries."* [**Terrorism and Communism**, p. 9 and p. 10]

Therefore, on the face of it, Rees's comments are hard to take
seriously. It is even harder to take when it becomes clear that Rees
does not apply his comments consistently or logically. He does not
object to quoting Lenin and Trotsky during this period when they say
something he **approves** of, regardless of how well it fits into their
actions. It would be no exaggeration to say that his *"argument"* is
simply an attempt to narrow the area of debate, marking off limits any
comments by his heroes which would place his ideology in a bad light. It
is hardly convincing, particularly when their *"good"* quotes are so at
odds with their practice and their *"bad"* quotes so in line with them.
And as Marx argued, we should judge people by what they do, **not** by
what they say. This seems a basic principle of scientific analysis and
it is significant, if not surprising, that Leninists like Rees want to
reject it.

Ultimately, the theoretical problem with this position is that it denies
the importance of implementing ideas. After all, even if it where true
that the *"theory"* of Bolshevism was different to its practice and the
justifications for that practice, it would leave us with the conclusion
that this *"theory"* was not sufficient when faced with the rigours of
reality. In other words, that it is impractical. A conclusion that
Leninists do not want to draw, hence the stress on *"objective factors"*
to explain the failure of Bolshevism. As Marx said, judge people by what
they do, not what they say (unless, of course, as with the Bolsheviks
post-October, what they said reflects what they did!)

Similarly, there seems to be an idealist tint to Leninist accounts of
the Russian Revolution. After all, they seem to think that the Lenin of
1921 was, essentially, the same person as the Lenin of 1917! That seems
to violate the basic ideas of materialism. As Herbert Read points out,
*"the phrase 'the dictatorship of the proletariat' . . . became fatal
through the interventions of two political expedients -- the
identification of the proletariat with the Bolshevik Party, and the use
of the State as an instrument of revolution. Expedients and compromises
may have been necessary for the defeat of the reactionary forces; but
there is no doubt whatsoever that what took place was a progressive
brutalisation of Lenin's own mind under the corrupting influence of the
exercise of power."* [**A One-Man Manifesto**, p. 51] It seems common
sense that if a political strategy exposes its followers to the
corrupting effects of power we should factor this into any evaluation of
it. Sadly, Leninists fail to do this -- even worse, they attempt to
whitewash the post-October Lenin (and Trotsky) by excluding the "bad"
quotes which reflect their practice, a practice which they are at pains
to downplay (or ignore)!

Then, of course, there is the attitude of the Bolshevik leaders
themselves to these so-called *"shouts of command in the midst of
battle."* Rather than dismiss them as irrelevant, they continued to
subscribe to them years later. For example, Trotsky was still in favour
of party dictatorship in the late 1930s (see [section
H.1.2](secH1.html#sech12)). Looking at his justly infamous **Terrorism
and Communism**, we discover Trotsky in the 1930s reiterating his
support for his arguments of 1920. His preface to the 1936 French
edition sees him state that it was *"devoted to a clarification of the
methods of the proletariat's revolutionary policy in our epoch."* He
concluded as follows: *"Victory is conceivable only on the basis of
Bolshevik methods, to the defence of which the present work is
devoted."* The previous year, in his introduction to the second English
edition, he was equally unrepentant. *"The British proletariat,"* he
argued, *"will enter upon a period of political crisis and theoretical
criticism . . . The teachings of Marx and Lenin for the first time will
find the masses as their audience. Such being the case, it may be also
that the present book will turn out to be not without its use."* He
dismissed the *"consoling illusion"* that *"the arguments of this book
[were] true for backward Russia"* but *"utterly without application to
advanced lands."* The *"wave of Fascist or militarised police
dictatorships"* in the 1920s and 1930s was the reason. It seems ironic
that Trotsky's self-proclaimed followers are now repeating the arguments
of what he termed "incurable Fabians." [**Terrorism and Communism**, p.
xix, p. xxxv, p. xlvii and p. xxxix]

Rather than distance himself from the authoritarian and state capitalist
policies modern day Leninists claim were thrust upon an unwilling
Bolshevik party by *"objective factors,"* Trotsky defends them!
Moreover, as we noted in [section 12](append42.html#app12) of the
appendix on ["What was the Kronstadt Rebellion?"](append42.html),
Trotsky himself argues that these *"objective factors"* would face
**every** revolution. As it is, he argues that it was only the *"slow
development of the revolution in the West"* which stopped *"a direct
passage from military Communism to a Socialistic system of production."*
Rather than admit to *"illusions"* caused by the "iron necessity" of
willing the civil war, he talks about *"those economic hopes which were
bound up with the development of the world revolution."* He even links
Bolshevik practice with Stalinism, noting that the *"idea of five-year
plans was not only formulated in that period [1918-1920], but in some
economic departments it was also technically worked out."* [**Op.
Cit.**, p. xliii]

Even his essay outlining what he considers the differences between
Stalinism and Bolshevism does not see him fundamentally distancing
himself from the positions modern day Leninists like to explain by
"objective factors." He stated that the *"Bolshevik party achieved in
the civil war the correct combination of military art and Marxist
politics."* What did that involve? Immediately before making that claim
he argued that the *"Bolshevik party has shown the entire world how to
carry out armed insurrection and the seizure of power. Those who propose
the abstraction of the Soviets from the party dictatorship should
understand that only thanks to the party dictatorship were the Soviets
able to lift themselves out of the mud of reformism and attain the state
form of the proletariat."* Thus the *"party dictatorship"* is seen as
being an example of *"Marxist politics"* being successfully applied and
not something to be opposed. Moreover, *"the Bolshevik party was able to
carry on its magnificent 'practical' work only because it illuminated
all its steps with theory."* [**Stalinism and Bolshevism**] Clearly,
rather than denounce the power of the party as being against Bolshevik
theory, as Rees claims, for Trotsky it represented its application.
While he excuses some Bolshevik actions (such as the banning of
opposition groups) as a product of *"objective factors,"* he clearly
sees the degeneration of the revolution coming **after** the civil war
and its *"correct combination"* of *"Marxist politics"* and *"military
art,"* which included *"party dictatorship"* over the soviets.

This lack of distancing is to be expected. After, the idea that
"objective factors" caused the degeneration of the Russian Revolution
was first developed by Trotsky to explain, after his fall from power)
the rise of Stalinism. While **he** was head of the Soviet state no such
"objective" factors seemed to be required to "explain" the party
dictatorship over the working class. Indeed, quite the reverse. As he
argued in 1923 *"[i]f there is one question which basically not only
does not require revision but does not so much as admit the thought of
revision, it is the question of the dictatorship of the Party."* [**Leon
Trotsky Speaks**, p. 158]

Trotsky was just stating mainstream Bolshevik ideology, echoing a
statement made in March 1923 by the Central Committee (of which he and
Lenin were members) to mark the 25th anniversary of the founding of the
Communist Party. It sums up the lessons gained from the revolution and
states that *"the party of the Bolsheviks proved able to stand out
fearlessly against the vacillations within its own class, vacillations
which, with the slightest weakness in the vanguard, could turn into an
unprecedented defeat for the proletariat."* Vacillations, of course, are
expressed by workers' democracy. Little wonder the statement rejects it:
*"The dictatorship of the working class finds its expression in the
dictatorship of the party."* [*"To the Workers of the USSR"* in G.
Zinoviev, **History of the Bolshevik Party**, p. 213, p. 214] It should
be noted that Trotsky had made identical comments before and immediately
after the civil war -- as well as long after (see [section
H.3.8](secH3.html#sech38) for details).

So, as with all the leading Bolsheviks, he considered the party
dictatorship as an inevitable result of any proletarian revolution
Moreover, he did not question the social relationships within production
either. One-man management held no fears for him and he called the state
capitalist regime under himself and Lenin as *"socialist"* and defended
it as such. He was fully supportive of one-man management. Writing in
1923, he argued that the *"system of actual one-man management must be
applied in the organisation of industry from top to bottom. For leading
economic organs of industry to really direct industry and to bear
responsibility for its fate, it is essential for them to have authority
over the selection of functionaries and their transfer and removal."*
These economic organs must *"in actual practice have full freedom of
selection and appointment."* [quoted by Robert V. Daniels, **A
Documentary History of Communism**, vol. 1, p. 237]

All of these post-civil war opinions of course, fit in well with his
civil war opinions on the matter. Which, incidentally, explains why, to
quote a Leninist, Trotsky *"continued to his death to harbour the
illusion that somehow, despite the lack of workers' democracy, Russia
was a 'workers' state.'"* Simply put, there had been no workers'
democracy under Lenin and Trotsky and he considered that regime a
*"workers' state."* The question arises why Harman thinks Lenin's Russia
was some kind of "workers' state" if workers' democracy is the criteria
by which such things are to be judged. But, then again, he thinks
Trotsky's **Left Opposition** *"framed a policy along [the] lines"* of
*"returning to genuine workers' democracy"*! [Chris Harman,**Bureaucracy
and Revolution in Eastern Europe**, p. 20 and p. 19]

Now, it seems strange that rather than present what he *"really"*
thought, Trotsky expounded what presumably is the **opposite** of it.
Surely the simplistic conclusion to draw is that Trotsky said what he
really did think and that this was identical to his so-called *"shouts
of command"* made during the civil war? But, of course, all these
comments can be dismissed as *"rhetorical justifications"* and not
reflective of Trotsky's real *"theory."* Or can they? Ultimately, either
you subscribe to the idea that Lenin and Trotsky were able to express
their ideas themselves or you subscribe to the notion that they hid
their *"real"* politics and only modern-day Leninists can determine what
they, in fact, *"really"* meant to say and what they "really" stood for.
And as for all those "awkward" quotes which express the **opposite** of
the divined true faith, well, they can be ignored.

Which is, of course, hardly a convincing position to take. Particularly
as Lenin and Trotsky were hardly shy in justifying their authoritarian
policies and expressing a distinct lack of concern over the fate of any
**meaningful** working class conquest of the revolution like, say,
soviet democracy. As Samuel Farber notes that *"there is no evidence
indicating that Lenin or any of the mainstream Bolshevik leaders
lamented the loss of workers' control or of democracy in the soviets, or
at least referred to these losses as a retreat, as Lenin declared with
the replacement of War Communism by NEP in 1921."* [**Before
Stalinism**, p. 44]

The sad fact is that the inter-party conflicts of the 1920s were **not**
about *"workers' democracy,"* rather party democracy. The Bolsheviks
simply relabelled *"party democracy"* as *"workers' democracy."* Little
wonder in 1925 that Max Eastman, one of Trotsky's main supporters at the
time, stated *"this programme of democracy within the party [was] called
'Workers' Democracy' by Lenin"* and that *"Trotsky merely revived this
original plea."* [**Since Lenin Died**, p. 35] Trotsky held this
position throughout the 1920s and 1930s. As we noted in [section
13](append42.html#app13) of the appendix on ["What was the Kronstadt
Rebellion?"](append42.html), the 1927 **Platform of the Opposition**
restated its belief in party dictatorship and argued that Stalin was
undermining it in favour of rule by the bureaucracy. Ironically,
Trotskyists in soviet prisons in the early 1930s *"continued to consider
that 'Freedom to choose one's party -- that is Menshevism'"* and this
was their *"final verdict."* [Ante Ciliga, **The Russian Enigma**, p.
280] No wonder they seemed surprised to be there!

Trotsky's issue with Stalinism was not based on **real** socialist
principles, such as meaningful working class freedoms and power. Rather
it was a case of *"the political centre of gravity ha[ving] shifted from
the proletarian vanguard to the bureaucracy"* and this caused *"the
party"* to change *"its social structure as well as in its ideology."*
[**Stalinism and Bolshevism**] The party dictatorship had been replaced
by the dictatorship of the state bureaucracy, in other words. Once this
happened, Trotsky sought to explain it. As analysing the impact of
Bolshevik ideology and practice were, by definition, out of the
question, that left the various objective factors Trotsky turned to to
explain developments after 1923. Now the concern for *"objective
factors"* appeared, to explain Stalinism while keeping true to Bolshevik
ideology **and** practice.

So, in summary, the leading Bolsheviks did not view "objective factors"
as explaining the failure of the revolution. Indeed, until Trotsky was
squeezed out of power they did not think that the revolution **had**
failed. Party dictatorship and one-man management were **not**
considered as expressions of a failed revolution, rather a successful
one. Trotsky's issue with Stalinism was simply that the bureaucracy had
replaced the *"the proletarian vanguard"* (i.e. himself and his
followers) as the dominant force in the Soviet State and it had started
to use the techniques of political repression developed against
opposition parties and groups against him. The idea that "objective
factors" caused the failure of the revolution was not used until the
late 1920s and even then not used to explain the party dictatorship but
rather the usurpation of **its** power by the bureaucracy.
