I.5 What could the social structure of anarchy look like?
=========================================================

The social and political structure of anarchy is similar to that of its
economic structure, i.e., it is based on a voluntary federation of
decentralised, directly democratic community assemblies (communes). In
these grassroots political units and their confederations, the concept
of ***"self-management"*** becomes that of ***"self-government"***, a
form of municipal organisation in which people take back control of
their living places from the bureaucratic state and the capitalist class
whose interests it serves. Bakunin's comments are very applicable here:

> *"[A] truly popular organisation begins from below, from the
> association, from the commune. Thus starting out with the organisation
> of the lowest nucleus and proceeding upward, federalism becomes a
> political institution of socialism, the free and spontaneous
> organisation of popular life."* [**The Political Philosophy of
> Bakunin**, pp. 273-4]

*"A new economic phase demands a new political phase,"* argued
Kropotkin, *"A revolution as profound as that dreamed of by the
socialists cannot accept the mould of an out-dated political life. A new
society based on equality of condition, on the collective possession of
the instruments of work, cannot tolerate for a week . . . the
representative system . . . if we want the social revolution, we must
seek a form of political organisation that will correspond to the new
method of economic organisation . . . The future belongs to the free
groupings of interests and not to governmental centralisation; it
belongs to freedom and not to authority."* [**Words of a Rebel**, pp.
143-4]

Thus the social structure of an anarchist society will be the opposite
of the current system. Instead of being centralised and top-down as in
the state, it will be decentralised and organised from the bottom up. As
Kropotkin argued, *"socialism must become **more popular**, more
communalistic, and less dependent upon indirect government through
elected representatives. It must become more **self-governing.**"*
[**Anarchism**, p. 185] In this, Kropotkin (like Bakunin) followed
Proudhon who argued that *"[u]nless democracy is a fraud, and the
sovereignty of the People a joke, it must be admitted that each citizen
in the sphere of his [or her] industry, each municipal, district or
provincial council within its own territory, is the only natural and
legitimate representative of the Sovereign, and that therefore each
locality should act directly and by itself in administering the
interests which it includes, and should exercise full sovereignty in
relation to them."* [**General Idea of the Revolution**, p. 276] While
anarchists have various different conceptions of how this communal
system would be constituted (as we will see), they is total agreement on
these basic visions and principles.

The aim is *"to found an order of things wherein the principle of the
sovereignty of the people, of man and of the citizen, would be
implemented to the letter"* and *"where every member"* of a society
*"retaining his independence and continuing to act as sovereign, would
be self-governing"* and any social organisation *"would concern itself
solely with collective matters; where as a consequence, there would be
certain common matters but no centralisation."* This means that the
*"federative, mutualist republican sentiment"* (as summarised these days
by the expression self-management) will *"bring about the victory of
Worker Democracy right around the world."* [Proudhon, **Anarchism**,
vol. 1, Robert Graham (ed.), p. 74 and p. 77]

This empowerment of ordinary citizens through decentralisation and
direct democracy will eliminate the alienation and apathy that are now
rampant and (as always happens when people are free) unleash a flood of
innovation in dealing with the social breakdown now afflicting our
world. The gigantic metropolis with its hierarchical and impersonal
administration, its atomised and isolated "residents," will be
transformed into a network of humanly scaled participatory communities,
each with its own unique character and forms of self-government, which
will be co-operatively linked through federation with other communities,
from the municipal through the bio-regional to the global level.

This means that the social perspective of libertarian socialism is as
distinctive as its economic vision. While mainstream socialism is marked
by support for centralised states, anarchists stay true to socialism as
equality and argue that means decentralisation. Thus socialism *"wears
two distinct faces. When it is said that a man is a Socialist, it is
implies that he regards the monopoly of private property in the means of
production as the cause of the existing unequal distribution of wealth
and its attendant ills . . . Socialists are divided into the
centralising and decentralising parties, the party of the State and the
party of the federatic commune."* [Charlotte M. Wilson, **Anarchist
Essays**, p. 37] Only such a federal, bottom-up, system can ensure
people can manage their own fates and ensure genuine freedom and
equality through mass participation and self-management.

Of course, it can (and has) been argued that people are just not
interested in "politics." Further, some claim that this disinterest is
why governments exist -- people delegate their responsibilities and
power to others because they have better things to do.

Such an argument, however, is flawed on empirical grounds. As we
indicated in [section B.2.6](secB2.html#secb26), centralisation of power
in both the French and American revolutions occurred **because** the
wealthy few thought that working class people were taking **too much**
interest in politics and social issues, not the reverse (*"To attack the
central power, to strip it of its prerogatives, to decentralise, to
dissolve authority, would have been to abandon to the people the control
of its affairs, to run the risk of a truly popular revolution. That is
why the bourgeoisie sought to reinforce the central government even
more. . ."* [Kropotkin, **Words of a Rebel**, p. 143]). Simply put, the
state is centralised to facilitate **minority rule** by excluding the
mass of people from taking part in the decision making processes within
society. This is to be expected as social structures do not evolve by
chance -- rather they develop to meet specific needs and requirements.
The specific need of the ruling class is to rule and that means
marginalising the bulk of the population. Its requirement is for
minority power and this is reflected in the structure of the state (see
[section H.3.7](secH3.html#sech37)).

Even if we ignore the historical evidence on this issue, anarchists do
not draw this conclusion from the current apathy that surrounds us. In
fact, we argue that this apathy is not the cause of government but its
result. Government is an inherently hierarchical system in which
ordinary people are deliberately marginalised. The powerlessness people
feel due to the workings of the system ensure that they are apathetic
about it, thus guaranteeing that wealthy and powerful elites govern
society without hindrance from the oppressed and exploited majority.

Moreover, government usually sticks its nose into areas that most people
have no real interest in. Some things, as in the regulation of industry
or workers' safety and rights, a free society could leave to those
affected to make their own decisions (we doubt that workers would
subject themselves to unsafe working conditions, for example). In
others, such as the question of personal morality and acts, a free
people would have no interest in (unless it harmed others, of course).
This, again, would reduce the number of issues that would be discussed
in a free commune. Also, via decentralisation, a free people would be
mainly discussing local issues, so reducing the complexity of many
questions and solutions. Wider issues would, of course, be discussed but
these would be on specific issues and so more focused in their nature
than those raised in the legislative bodies of the state. So, a
combination of centralisation and an irrational desire to discuss every
and all questions also helps make "politics" seem boring and irrelevant.

As noted above, this result is not an accident and the marginalisation
of "ordinary" people is actually celebrated in bourgeois "democratic"
theory. As Noam Chomsky notes:

> *"Twentieth century democratic theorists advise that 'The public must
> be put in its place,' so that the 'responsible men' may 'live free of
> the trampling and roar of a bewildered herd,' 'ignorant and meddlesome
> outsiders' whose 'function' is to be 'interested spectators of
> action,' not participants, lending their weight periodically to one or
> another of the leadership class (elections), then returning to their
> private concerns. (Walter Lippman). The great mass of the population,
> 'ignorant and mentally deficient,' must be kept in their place for the
> common good, fed with 'necessary illusion' and 'emotionally potent
> oversimplifications' (Wilson's Secretary of State Robert Lansing,
> Reinhold Niebuhr). Their 'conservative' counterparts are only more
> extreme in their adulation of the Wise Men who are the rightful rulers
> -- in the service of the rich and powerful, a minor footnote regularly
> forgotten."* [**Year 501**, p. 18]

This marginalisation of the public from political life ensures that the
wealthy can be *"left alone"* to use their power as they see fit. In
other words, such marginalisation is a necessary part of a fully
functioning capitalist society and so libertarian social structures have
to be discouraged. Or as Chomsky put it, the *"rabble must be instructed
in the values of subordination and a narrow quest for personal gain
within the parameters set by the institutions of the masters; meaningful
democracy, with popular association and action, is a threat to be
overcome."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 18] This philosophy can be seen in the
statement of a US Banker in Venezuela under the murderous Jimenez
dictatorship:

> *"You have the freedom here to do whatever you want to do with your
> money, and to me, that is worth all the political freedom in the
> world."* [quoted by Chomsky, **Op. Cit.**, p. 99]

Deterring libertarian alternatives to statism is a common feature of our
current system. By marginalising and disempowering people, the ability
of individuals to manage their own social activities is undermined and
weakened. They develop a "fear of freedom" and embrace authoritarian
institutions and "strong leaders", which in turn reinforces their
marginalisation.

This consequence is hardly surprising. Anarchists maintain that the
desire to participate and the ability to participate are in a symbiotic
relationship: participation builds on itself. By creating the social
structures that allow participation, participation will increase. As
people increasingly take control of their lives, so their ability to do
so also increases. The challenge of having to take responsibility for
decisions that make a difference is at the same time an opportunity for
personal development. To begin to feel power, having previously felt
powerless, to win access to the resources required for effective
participation and learn how to use them, is a liberating experience.
Once people become active subjects, making things happen in one aspect
of their lives, they are less likely to remain passive objects, allowing
things to happen to them, in other aspects.

All in all, "politics" is far too important an subject to leave to
politicians, the wealthy and bureaucrats. After all, it is (or, at
least, it should be) what affects, your friends, community, and,
ultimately, the planet you live on. Such issues cannot be left to anyone
but you.

Hence a meaningful communal life based on self-empowered individuals is
a distinct possibility (indeed, it has repeatedly appeared throughout
history). It is the hierarchical structures in statism and capitalism,
marginalising and disempowering the majority, which is at the root of
the current wide scale apathy in the face of increasing social and
ecological disruption. Libertarian socialists therefore call for a
radically new form of political system to replace the centralised
nation-state, a form that would be based around confederations of
self-governing communities: *"**Society is a society of societies; a
league of leagues of leagues; a commonwealth of commonwealths of
commonwealths; a republic of republics of republics.** Only there is
freedom and order, only there is spirit, a spirit which is
self-sufficiency and community, unity and independence."* [Gustav
Landauer, **For Socialism**, pp. 125-126]

To create such a system would require dismantling the nation-state and
reconstituting relations between communities on the basis of
self-determination and free and equal confederation from below. In the
following subsections we will examine in more detail why this new system
is needed and what it might look like. As we have stressed repeatedly,
these are just suggestions of possible anarchist solutions to social
organisation. Most anarchists recognise that anarchist communities will
co-exist with non-anarchist ones after the destruction of the existing
state. As we are anarchists we are discussing anarchist visions. We will
leave it up to non-anarchists to paint their own pictures of a possible
future.

I.5.1 What are participatory communities?
-----------------------------------------

A key concept in anarchist thought is that of the participatory
community. Traditionally, these participatory communities are called
**communes** in anarchist theory (*"The basic social and economic cell
of the anarchist society is the free, independent commune"* [A. Grachev,
quoted by Paul Avrich, **The Anarchists in the Russian Revolution**, p.
64]).

The reason for the use of the term commune is due to anarchism's roots
in France where it refers to the lowest level of administrative division
in the Republic. In France, a commune can be a city of 2 million
inhabitants (hence the Paris Commune of 1871); a town of 10,000; or just
a 10-person hamlet. It appeared in the 12th century from Medieval Latin
**communia**, which means a gathering of people sharing a common life
(from Latin **communis**, things held in common). Proudhon used the term
to describe the social units of a non-statist society and subsequent
anarchists like Bakunin and Kropotkin followed his lead. As the term
"commune", since the 1960s, often refers to "intentional communities"
where people drop out of society and form their own counter-cultural
groups and living spaces we have, in order to avoid confusion, decided
to use "participatory community" as well (anarchists have also used
other terms, including *"free municipality"*).

These community organisations are seen as the way people participate in
the decisions that affect them and their neighbourhoods, regions and,
ultimately, planet. These are the means for transforming our social
environment from one disfigured by economic and political power and its
needs to one fit for human beings to life and flourish in. The creation
of a network of participatory communities ("communes") based on
self-government through direct, face-to-face democracy in grassroots
neighbourhood assemblies is the means to that end. As we argued in
[section I.2.3](secI2.html#seci23) such assemblies will be born in
social struggle and so reflect the needs of the struggle and those
within it so our comments here must be considered as generalisations of
the salient features of such communities and **not** blue-prints.

Within anarchist thought, there are two main conceptions of the free
commune. One vision is based on workplace delegates, the other on
neighbourhood assemblies. We will sketch each in turn.

The first type of participatory community (in which *"the federative
Alliance of all working men's associations . . . will constitute the
commune"*) is most associated with Bakunin. He argued that the *"future
social organisation must be made solely from the bottom upwards, by the
free association or federation of workers, firstly in their unions, then
in communes, regions, nations and finally in a great federation,
international and universal."* [**Michael Bakunin: Selected Writings**,
p. 170 and p. 206] This vision was stressed by later anarchist thinkers.
For example, Spanish anarchist Issac Puente thought that in towns and
cities *"the part of the free municipality is played by local federation
. . . Ultimate sovereignty in the local federation of industrial unions
lies with the general assembly of all local producers."* [**Libertarian
Communism**, p. 27] The Russian anarchist G. P. Maximoff saw the
*"communal confederation"* as being *"constituted by thousands of freely
acting labour organisations."* [**The Program of Anarcho-Syndicalism**,
p. 43]

This vision of the commune was created during many later revolutions
(such as in Russia in 1905 and 1917 as well as Hungary in 1956). Being
based on workplaces, this form of commune has the advantage of being
based on groups of people who are naturally associated during most of
the day (Bakunin considered workplace bodies as *"the natural
organisation of the masses"* as they were *"based on the various types
of work"* which *"define their actual day-to-day life"* [**The Basic
Bakunin**, p. 139]). This would facilitate the organisation of
assemblies, discussion on social, economic and political issues and the
mandating and recalling of delegates. Moreover, it combines political
and economic power in one organisation, so ensuring that the working
class actually manages society.

Other anarchists counterpoise neighbourhood assemblies to workers'
councils. These assemblies will be general meetings open to all citizens
in every neighbourhood, town, and village, and will be the source of
public policy for all levels of confederal co-ordination. Such "town
meetings" will bring people directly into the political process and give
them an equal voice in the decisions that affect their lives. Such
anarchists point to the experience of the French Revolution of 1789 and
the *"sections"* of the Paris Commune as the key example of *"a people
governing itself directly -- when possible -- without intermediaries,
without masters."* It is argued, based on this experience, that *"the
principles of anarchism . . . dated from 1789, and that they had their
origin, not in theoretical speculations, but in the **deeds** of the
Great French Revolution."* [Peter Kropotkin, **The Great French
Revolution**, vol. 1, p. 210 and p. 204] Anarchists also point to the
clubs created during the 1848 Revolution in France and in the Paris
Commune of 1871 not to mention the community assemblies created in
Argentina during the revolt against neo-liberalism at the start of the
21st century.

Critics of workers' councils point out that not all people work in
traditional workplaces (many are parents who look after children, for
example). By basing the commune around the workplace, such people are
automatically excluded. Moreover, in most modern cities many people do
not live near where they work. It would mean that local affairs could
not be effectively discussed in a system of workers' councils as many
who take part in the debate are unaffected by the decisions reached. In
addition, some anarchists argue that workplace based systems
automatically generate "special interests" and so exclude community
issues. Only community assemblies can *"transcend the traditional
special interests of work, workplace, status, and property relations,
and create a **general** interest based on shared community problems."*
[Murray Bookchin, **From Urbanisation to Cities**, p. 254]

However, such communities assemblies can only be valid if they can be
organised rapidly in order to make decisions and to mandate and recall
delegates. In the capitalist city, many people work far from where they
live and so such meetings have to be called for after work or at
weekends (thus the key need is to reduce the working day/week and to
communalise industry). For this reason, many anarchists continue to
support the workers' council vision of the commune, complemented by
community assemblies for those who live in an area but do not work in a
traditional workplace (e.g. parents bringing up small children, the old,
the sick and so on). It should be noted that this is something which the
supporters of workers' councils **have** noticed and some argue for
councils which are delegates from both the inhabitants **and** the
enterprises of an area.

These positions are not hard and fast divisions, far from it. Puente,
for example, thought that in the countryside the dominant commune would
be *"all the residents of a village or hamlet meeting in an assembly
(council) with full powers to administer local affairs."* [**Op. Cit.**,
p. 25] Kropotkin supported the soviets of the Russian Revolution,
arguing that the *"idea of soviets . . . of councils of workers and
peasants . . . controlling the economic and political life of the
country is a great idea. All the more so, since it necessarily follows
that these councils should be composed of all who take part in the
production of natural wealth by their own efforts."* [**Anarchism**, p.
254]

Which method, workers' councils or community assemblies, will be used in
a given community will depend on local conditions, needs and aspirations
and it is useless to draw hard and fast rules. It is likely that some
sort of combination of the two approaches will be used, with workers'
councils being complemented by community assemblies until such time as a
reduced working week and decentralisation of urban centres make purely
community assemblies the more realistic option. It is likely that in a
fully libertarian society, community assemblies will be the dominant
communal organisation but in the period immediately after a revolution
this may not be immediately possible. Objective conditions, rather than
predictions, will be the deciding factor. Under capitalism, anarchists
pursue both forms of organisation, arguing for community **and**
industrial unionism in the class struggle (see sections
[J.5.1](secJ5.html#secj51) and [J.5.2](secJ5.html#secj52)).

Regardless of the exact make up of the commune, it has certain key
features. It would be free a association, based upon the self-assumed
obligation of those who join them. In free association, participation is
essential simply because it is the **only** means by which individuals
can collectively govern themselves (and unless they govern themselves,
someone else will). *"As a unique individual,"* Stirner argued, *"you
can assert yourself alone in association, because the association does
not own you, because you are one who owns it or who turns it to your own
advantage."* The rules governing the association are determined by the
associated and can be changed by them (and so a vast improvement over
"love it or leave") as are the policies the association follows. Thus,
the association *"does not impose itself as a spiritual power superior
to my spirit. I have no wish to become a slave to my maxims, but would
rather subject them to my ongoing criticism."* [Max Stirner, **No Gods,
No Masters**, vol. 1, p. 17]

Thus participatory communities are freely joined and self-managed by
their members with no division between order givers and order takers as
exists within the state. Rather the associated govern themselves and
while the assembled people collectively decide the rules governing their
association, and are bound by them as individuals, they are also
superior to them in the sense that these rules can always be modified or
repealed (see [section A.2.11](secA2.html#seca211) for more details). As
can be seen, a participatory commune is new form of social life,
radically different from the state as it is decentralised,
self-governing and based upon individual autonomy and free agreement.
Thus Kropotkin:

> *"The representative system was organised by the bourgeoisie to ensure
> their domination, and it will disappear with them. For the new
> economic phase that is about to begin we must seek a new form of
> political organisation, based on a principle quite different from that
> of representation. The logic of events imposes it."* [**Words of a
> Rebel**, p. 125]

This *"new form of political organisation has to be worked out the
moment that socialistic principles shall enter our life. And it is
self-evident that this new form will have to be **more popular, more
decentralised, and nearer to the folk-mote self-government** than
representative government can ever be."* Kropotkin, like all anarchists,
considered the idea that socialism could be created by taking over the
current state or creating a new one as doomed to failure. Instead, he
recognised that socialism would only be built using new organisations
that reflect the spirit of socialism (such as freedom, self-government
and so on). He, like Proudhon and Bakunin before him, therefore argued
that *"**[t]his was the form that the social revolution must take** --
the independent commune. . . [whose] inhabitants have decided that they
**will** communalise the consumption of commodities, their exchange and
their production."* [Kropotkin, **Anarchism**, p. 184 and p. 163]

In a nutshell, a participatory community is a free association, based
upon the mass assembly of people who live in a common area, the means by
which they make the decisions that affect them, their communities,
bio-regions and the planet. Their essential task is to provide a forum
for raising public issues and deciding upon them. Moreover, these
assemblies will be a key way of generating a community (and community
spirit) and building and enriching social relationships between
individuals and, equally important, of developing and enriching
individuals by the very process of participation in communal affairs. By
discussing, thinking and listening to others, individuals develop their
own abilities and powers while at the same time managing their own
affairs, so ensuring that no one else does (i.e. they govern themselves
and are no longer governed from above by others). As Kropotkin argued,
self-management has an educational effect on those who practice it:

> *"The 'permanence' of the general assemblies of the sections -- that
> is, the possibility of calling the general assembly whenever it was
> wanted by the members of the section and of discussing everything in
> the general assembly. . . will educate every citizen politically. . .
> The section in permanence -- the forum always open -- is the only way
> . . . to assure an honest and intelligent administration."* [**The
> Great French Revolution**, vol. 1, pp. 210-1]

As well as integrating the social life of a community and encouraging
the political and social development of its members, these free communes
will also be integrated into the local ecology. Humanity would life in
harmony with nature as well as with itself -- as discussed in [section
E.2](secE2.html), these would be **eco**-communities part of their local
eco-systems with a balanced mix of agriculture and industry (as
described by Kropotkin in his classic work **Fields, Factories and
Workshops**). Thus a free commune would aim to integrate the individual
into social and communal life, rural and urban life into a balanced
whole and human life into the wider ecology. In this way the free
commune would make human habitation fully ecological, ending the sharp
and needless (and dehumanising and de-individualising) division of human
life from the rest of the planet. The commune will be a key means of the
expressing diversity within humanity and the planet as well as improving
the quality of life in society:

> *"The Commune . . . will be entirely devoted to improving the communal
> life of the locality. Making their requests to the appropriate
> Syndicates, Builders', Public Health, Transport or Power, the
> inhabitants of each Commune will be able to gain all reasonable living
> amenities, town planning, parks, play-grounds, trees in the street,
> clinics, museums and art galleries. Giving, like the medieval city
> assembly, an opportunity for any interested person to take part in,
> and influence, his town's affairs and appearance, the Commune will be
> a very different body from the borough council . . .*

> *"In ancient and medieval times cities and villages expressed the
> different characters of different localities and their inhabitants. In
> redstone, Portland or granite, in plaster or brick, in pitch of roof,
> arrangements of related buildings or patterns of slate and thatch each
> locality added to the interests of travellers . . . each expressed
> itself in castle, home or cathedral.*

> *"How different is the dull, drab, or flashy ostentatious monotony of
> modern England. Each town is the same. The same Woolworth's, Odeon
> Cinemas, and multiple shops, the same 'council houses' or
> 'semi-detached villas' . . . North, South, East or West, what's the
> difference, where is the change?*

> *"With the Commune the ugliness and monotony of present town and
> country life will be swept away, and each locality and region, each
> person will be able to express the joy of living, by living
> together."* [Tom Brown, **Syndicalism**, p. 59]

The size of the neighbourhood assemblies will vary, but it will probably
fluctuate around some ideal size, discoverable in practice, that will
provide a viable scale of face-to-face interaction and allow for both a
variety of personal contacts. This suggests that any town or city would
itself be a confederation of assemblies -- as was, of course, practised
very effectively in Paris during the Great French Revolution.

Such assemblies would meet regularly, at the very least monthly
(probably more often, particularly during periods which require fast and
frequent decision making, like a revolution) and deal with a variety of
issues. In the words of the CNT's resolution on libertarian communism:

> *"the foundation of this administration will be the commune. These
> communes are to be autonomous and will be federated at regional and
> national levels to achieve their general goals. The right to autonomy
> does not preclude the duty to implement agreements regarding
> collective benefits . . . [A] commune without any voluntary
> restrictions will undertake to adhere to whatever general norms may be
> agreed by majority vote after free debate . . . the commune is to be
> autonomous and confederated with the other communes . . . the commune
> will have the duty to concern itself with whatever may be of interest

> *"It will have to oversee organising, running and beautification of
> the settlement. It will see that its inhabitants are housed and that
> items and products be made available to them by the producers' unions
> or associations.*

> *"Similarly, it is to concern itself with hygiene, the keeping of
> communal statistics and with collective requirements such as
> education, health services and with the maintenance and improvement of
> local means of communication.*

> *"It will orchestrate relations with other communes and will take care
> to stimulate all artistic and cultural pursuits.*

> *"So that this mission may be properly fulfilled, a communal council

> communal assemblies.*

> *"Assemblies are to be summoned as often as required by communal
> interests, upon the request of the communal council or according to
> the wishes of the inhabitants of each commune . . . The inhabitants of
> a commune are to debate among themselves their internal problems."*
> [quoted by Jose Peirats, **The CNT in the Spanish Revolution**, vol.
> 1, pp. 106-7]

Thus the communal assembly discusses that which affects the community
and those within it. As these local community associations will be
members of larger communal bodies, the communal assembly will also
discuss issues which affect wider areas, as indicated, and mandate their
delegates to discuss them at confederation assemblies. This system, we
must note, was applied with great success during numerous revolutions
(see [section J.5.4](secJ5.html#secj54)) and so cannot be dismissed as
wishful thinking.

However, of course, the actual framework of a free society will be
worked out in practice. As Bakunin correctly argued, society *"can, and
must, organise itself in a different fashion [than what came before],
but not from top to bottom and according to an ideal plan"* [**Michael
Bakunin: Selected Writings**, p. 205] What does seem likely is that
confederations of communes will be required. We turn to this in the
[next section](secI5.html#seci52).

I.5.2 Why are confederations of participatory communities needed?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Since not all issues are local, the community assemblies will also elect
mandated and recallable delegates to the larger-scale units of
self-government in order to address issues affecting urban districts,
the city or town as a whole, the county, the bio-region, and ultimately
the entire planet. Thus the assemblies will confederate at several
levels in order to develop and co-ordinate common policies to deal with
common problems. In the words of the CNT's resolution on libertarian
communism:

> *"The inhabitants of a commune are to debate among themselves their
> internal problems . . . Federations are to deliberate over major
> problems affecting a country or province and all communes are to be
> represented at their reunions and assemblies, thereby enabling their
> delegates to convey the democratic viewpoint of their respective
> communes.*

> *"If, say, roads have to be built to link villages of a county or any
> matter arises to do with transportation and exchange of produce
> between agricultural and industrial counties, then naturally every
> commune which is implicated will have its right to have its say.*

> *"On matters of a regional nature, it is the duty of the regional
> federation to implement agreements which will represent the sovereign
> will of all the region's inhabitants. So the starting point is the
> individual, moving on through the commune, to the federation and right
> on up finally to the confederation.*

In other words, the commune *"cannot any longer acknowledge any
superior: that, above it, there cannot be anything, save the interests
of the Federation, freely embraced by itself in concert with other
Communes."* [Kropotkin, **No Gods, No Masters**, vol. 1, p. 259]

Federalism is applicable at all levels of society. As Kropotkin pointed
out, anarchists *"understand that if no central government was needed to
rule the independent communes, if national government is thrown
overboard and national unity is obtained by free federation, then a
central **municipal** government becomes equally useless and noxious.
The same federative principle would do within the commune."*
[**Anarchism**, pp. 163-164] Thus the whole of society would be a free
federation, from the local community right up to the global level. And
this free federation would be based squarely on the autonomy and
self-government of local groups. With federalism, co-operation replaces
coercion.

This need for co-operation does not imply a centralised body. To
exercise your autonomy by joining self-managing organisations and,
therefore, agreeing to abide by the decisions you help make is not a
denial of that autonomy (unlike joining a hierarchical structure, where
you forsake autonomy **within** the organisation). In a **centralised**
system, we must stress, **power** rests at the top and the role of those
below is simply to obey (it matters not if those with the power are
elected or not, the principle is the same). In a **federal** system,
power is **not** delegated into the hands of a few (obviously a
"federal" government or state is a centralised system). Decisions in a
federal system are made at the base of the organisation and flow upwards
so ensuring that power remains decentralised in the hands of all.
Working together to solve common problems and organise common efforts to
reach common goals is not centralisation and those who confuse the two
make a serious error -- they fail to understand the different relations
of authority each generates and confuse obedience with co-operation.

As in the economic federation of syndicates, the lower levels will
control the higher, thus eliminating the current pre-emptive powers of
centralised government hierarchies. Delegates to higher-level
co-ordinating councils or conferences will be instructed, at every level
of confederation, by the assemblies they come from on how to deal with
any issues. These instructions will be binding, committing delegates to
a framework of policies within which they must act and providing for
their recall and the nullification of their decisions if they fail to
carry out their mandates. Delegates may be selected by election and/or
sortition (i.e. random selection by lot, as for jury duty currently). As
Murray Bookchin argued:

> *"A confederalist view involves a clear distinction between policy
> making and the co-ordination and execution of adopted policies. Policy
> making is exclusively the right of popular community assemblies based
> on the practices of participatory democracy. Administration and
> co-ordination are the responsibility of confederal councils, which
> become the means for interlinking villages, towns, neighbourhoods, and
> cities into confederal networks. Power flows from the bottom up
> instead of from the top down, and in confederations, the flow of power
> from the bottom up diminishes with the scope of the federal council
> ranging territorially from localities to regions and from regions to
> ever-broader territorial areas."* [**From Urbanisation to Cities**, p.
> 253]

Thus the people will have the final word on policy, which is the essence
of self-government, and each citizen will have his or her turn to
participate in the co-ordination of public affairs. In other words,
self-government will be the people themselves organised in their
community assemblies and their confederal co-ordinating councils, with
any delegates limited to implementing policy formulated by the people.
Such policies will still be subject to approval by the neighbourhood and
community assemblies through their right to recall their delegates and
revoke their decisions. Needless to say, the higher the confederation
the less often it would meet and the less it would have to consider in
terms of issues to decide. On such a level, only the most general issues
and decisions could be reached (in effect, only guidelines which the
member confederations would apply as they saw fit).

In such a system there will, undoubtedly, be the need for certain
individuals to be allocated certain tasks to do. We stress the word
"tasks" because their work is essentially administrative in nature,
without power. For example, an individual or a group of individuals may
be elected to look into alternative power supplies for a community and
report back on what they discover. They cannot impose their decision
**onto** the community as they do not have the power to do so. They
simply present their findings to the body which had mandated them. These
findings are **not** a law which the electors are required to follow,
but a series of suggestions and information from which the assembled
people chose what they think is best. Or, to use another example,
someone may be elected to overlook the installation of a selected power
supply but the decision on what power supply to use and which specific
project to implement has been decided upon by the whole community.
Similarly with any delegate elected to a confederal council.

The scales and levels of confederation can only be worked out in
practice. In general, it would be safe to say that confederations would
be needed on a wide scale, starting with towns and cities and then
moving onto regional and other levels. No village, town or city could be
self-sufficient nor would desire to be -- communication and links with
other places are part and parcel of life and anarchists have no desire
to retreat back into an isolated form of localism:

> *"No community can hope to achieve economic autarchy, nor should it
> try to do so. Economically, the wide range of resources that are
> needed to make many of our widely used goods preclude self-enclosed
> insularity and parochialism. Far from being a liability, this
> interdependence among communities and regions can well be regarded as
> an asset -- culturally as well as politically . . . Divested of the
> cultural cross-fertilisation that is often a product of economic
> intercourse, the municipality tends to shrink into itself and
> disappear into its own civic privatism. Shared needs and resources
> imply the existence of sharing and, with sharing, communication,
> rejuvenation by new ideas, and a wider social horizon that yields a
> wider sensibility to new experiences."* [Bookchin, **Op. Cit.**, p.
> 237]

Combined with this consideration, we must also raise the issue of
economies of scale. A given level of confederation may be required to
make certain social and economic services efficient (we are thinking of
economies of scale for such social needs as universities, hospitals, and
cultural institutions). While every commune may have a doctor, nursery,
local communal stores and small-scale workplaces, not all can have a
university, hospital, factories and so forth. These would be organised
on a wider level, so necessitating the appropriate confederation to
exist to manage them. Ties between bio-regions or larger territories
based on the distribution of such things as geographically concentrated
mineral deposits, climate dependent crops, and production facilities
that are most efficient when concentrated in one area will unite
communities confederally on the basis of common material needs as well
as values.

This means that the scale and level of the confederations created by the
communes will be varied and extensive. It would be hard to generalise
about them, particularly as different confederations will exist for
different tasks and interests. Moreover, any system of communes would
start off based on the existing villages, towns and cities of
capitalism. That is unavoidable and will, of course, help determine the
initial scale and level of confederations.

In urban areas, the town or city would have to be broken down into
confederations and these confederations would constitute the town or
city assembly of delegates. Given a huge city like London, New York or
Mexico City it would be impossible to organise in any other way. Smaller
towns would probably be able to have simpler confederations. We must
stress that few, if any, anarchists consider it desirable to have huge
cities in a free society and one of the major tasks of social
transformation will be to break the metropolis into smaller units,
integrated with the local environment. However, a social revolution will
take place in these vast metropolises and so we have to take them into
account in our discussion.

In summary, the size and scale of confederations will depend on
practical considerations, based on what people found were optimal sizes
for their neighbourhood assemblies and the needs of co-operation between
them, towns, cities, regions and so on. We cannot, and have no wish, to
predict the development of a free society. Therefore the scale and
levels of confederation will be decided by those actually creating an
anarchist world although it is almost certain that levels of
confederation would be dependent on the number of delegates required.
After a certain number, the confederation assembly may became difficult
to manage, so implying that another level of confederation is required.
This would, undoubtedly, be the base for determining the scale and level
of confederation, ensuring that any confederal assembly can actually
manage its activities and remain under the control of lower levels.

Finally, confederations are required to ensure solidarity can be
expressed in the unlikely situation of local oppression. After all,
history is full of local communities which have been oppressive to
minorities within them (most obviously, the American South) and so
confederation is required so that members of any such minority can
appeal for help and mutual aid to end its domination. Equally, though,
confederation is needed to ensure that local communes can experiment and
try out new ideas without having to wait until the majority agree to it
as would be required in a centralised system.

Thus confederations of communes are required to co-ordinate joint
activity and discuss common issues and interests. It is also required to
protect individual, community and social freedom as well as allowing
social experimentation and protecting the distinctiveness, dignity,
freedom and self-management of communities and so society as a whole.
Thus *"socialism is federalist"* and *"true federalism, the political
organisation of socialism, will be attained only when these popular
grass-roots institutions [namely, *"communes, industrial and
agricultural associations"*] are organised in progressive stages from
the bottom up."* [Bakunin, **Bakunin on Anarchism**, p. 402]

I.5.3 Would confederations produce bureaucrats and politicians?
---------------------------------------------------------------

Of course, **any** organisation holds the danger that the few who have
been given tasks to perform could misuse their position for personal
benefit or, over time, evolve into a bureaucracy with power over the
rest of society. As such, some critics of social anarchism suggest that
a system of communes and confederations would simply be a breeding
ground for politicians and bureaucrats. This is obviously the case with
the state and many generalise from this experience for **all** forms of
social organisation, including the anarchist commune.

While recognising that this **is** a danger, anarchists are sure that
such developments are unlikely in an anarchy. This is because, based on
our analysis and critique of the state, we have long argued for various
institutional arrangements which reduce the danger of such things
developing. These include electing delegates rather than
representatives, giving these delegates a binding mandate and subjecting
them to instant recall by their electors. They would **not**, in
general, be paid and so, in other words, delegates are expected, as far
as possible, to remain in their current communities and conduct their
communal tasks after their usual work. For the few exceptions to this
that may occur, delegates would receive the average pay of their
commune, in mutualism and collectivism or, in communism, no special
access to communal resources. Moreover, it seems likely that regular
rotation of delegates would be utilised and, perhaps, random selection
as happens in jury duty today in many countries. Lastly, communes could
leave any confederation if its structure was becoming obviously
misshapen and bureaucratic.

By these methods, delegates to communal bodies would remain under the
control of their electors and not, as in the state, become their
masters. Moreover, anarchists have stressed that any communal body must
be a working organisation. This will reduce bureaucratic tendencies as
implementing tasks will be done by elected delegates rather than
faceless (and usually unelected) bureaucrats. This means, as Bakunin put
it in 1868, that *"the Communal Council"* (made up of delegates *"with
binding mandates and accountable and revocable at all times"*) would
create *"separate executive committees from among its membership for
each branch of the Commune's revolutionary administration."* [Bakunin,
**No Gods, No Masters**, vol. 1, p. 155] Thus would no longer be a body
of people, a government, separate from the delegates of the people.
This, it should be noted, echoed Proudhon's comments from 1848:

> *"It is up to the National Assembly, through organisation of its
> committees, to exercise executive power, just the way it exercises
> legislative power . . . Besides universal suffrage and as a
> consequence of universal suffrage, we want implementation of the
> binding mandate. Politicians balk at it! Which means that in their
> eyes, the people, in electing representatives, do not appoint
> mandatories but rather abjure their sovereignty! That is assuredly not
> socialism: it is not even democracy."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 63]

Due to mandating and recall, any delegate who starts to abuse their
position or even vote in ways opposed to by the communal assembly would
quickly be recalled and replaced. As such a person may be an elected
delegate of the community but that does not mean that they have power or
authority (i.e., they are **not** a representative but rather a
delegate). Essentially they are an agent of the local community who is
controlled by, and accountable to, that community. Clearly, such people
are unlike politicians. They do not, and cannot, make policy decisions
on behalf of (i.e., govern) those who elected them -- they are not given
power to make decisions for people. In addition, people in specific
organisations or with specific tasks will be rotated frequently to
prevent a professionalisation of politics and the problem of politicians
being largely on their own once elected. And, of course, they will
continue to work and live with those who elected them and receive no
special privileges due to their election (in terms of more income,
better housing, and so on). This means that such delegates would be
extremely unlikely to turn into representatives or bureaucrats as they
would be under the strict control of the organisations that elected them
to such posts. As Kropotkin argued, the general assembly of the
community *"in permanence - the forum always open -- is the only way . .
. to assure an honest and intelligent administration"* as it is based
upon *"**distrust of all executive powers.**"* [**The Great French
Revolution**, Vol. 1, p. 211]

The current means of co-ordinating wide scale activity -- centralism via
the state -- is a threat to freedom as, to quote Proudhon, *"the citizen
divests himself of sovereignty, the town and the Department and province
above it, absorbed by central authority, are no longer anything but
agencies under direct ministerial control."* *"The Consequences"* he
continued, *"soon make themselves felt: the citizen and the town are
deprived of all dignity, the state's depredations multiply, and the
burden on the taxpayer increases in proportion. It is no longer the
government that is made for the people; it is the people who are made
for the government. Power invades everything, dominates everything,
absorbs everything."* [**The Principle of Federation**, p. 59] In such a
regime, the generation of a specific caste of politicians and
bureaucrats is inevitable.

Moreover, *"[t]he principle of political centralism is openly opposed to
all laws of social progress and of natural evolution. It lies in the
nature of things that every cultural advance is first achieved within a
small group and only gradually finds adoption by society as a whole.
Therefore, political decentralisation is the best guaranty for the
unrestricted possibilities of new experiments. For such an environment
each community is given the opportunity to carry through the things
which it is capable of accomplishing itself without imposing them on
others. Practical experimentation is the parent of ever development in
society. So long as each distinct is capable of effecting the changes
within its own sphere which its citizens deem necessary, the example of
each becomes a fructifying influence on the other parts of the community
since they will have the chance to weigh the advantages accruing from
them without being forced to adopt them if they are not convinced of
their usefulness. The result is that progressive communities serve the
others as models, a result justified by the natural evolution of
things."* [Rudolf Rocker, **Pioneers of American Freedom**, pp. 16-7]
The contrast with centralisation of the state could not be more clear.
Rocker continued:

> *"In a strongly centralised state, the situation is entirely reversed
> and the best system of representation can do nothing to change that.
> The representatives of a certain district may have the overwhelming
> majority of a certain district on his [or her] side, but in the
> legislative assembly of the central state, he [or she] will remain in
> the minority, for it lies in the nature of things that in such a body
> not the intellectually most active but the most backward districts
> represent the majority. Since the individual district has indeed the
> right to give expression of its opinion, but can effect no changes
> without the consent of the central government, the most progressive
> districts will be condemned to stagnate while the most backward
> districts will set the norm."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 17]

Little wonder anarchists have always stressed what Kropotkin termed
*"local action"* and considered the libertarian social revolution as
*"proceed[ing] by proclaiming independent Communes which Communes will
endeavour to accomplish the economic transformation within . . . their
respective surroundings."* [Peter Kropotkin, **Act For Yourselves**, p.
43] Thus the advanced communities will inspire the rest to follow them
by showing them a practical example of what is possible. Only
decentralisation and confederation can promote the freedom and resulting
social experimentation which will ensure social progress and make
society a good place to live.

Moreover, confederation is required to maximise self-management and
reduce the possibility that delegates will become isolated from the
people who mandated them. As Rocker explained:

> *"In a smaller community, it is far easier for individuals to observe
> the political scene and become acquainted with the issues which have
> to be resolved. This is quite impossible for a representative in a
> centralised government. Neither the single citizen nor his [or her]
> representative is completely or even approximately to supervise the
> huge clockwork of the central state machine. The deputy is forced
> daily to make decisions about things of which he [or she] has no
> personal knowledge and for the appraisal of which he must therefore
> depend on others [i.e. bureaucrats and lobbyists]. That such a system
> necessarily leads to serious errors and mistakes is self-evident. And
> since the citizen for the same reason is not able to inspect and
> criticise the conduct of his representative, the class of professional
> politicians is given added opportunity to fish in troubled waters."*
> [**Op. Cit.**, p. 17-18]

These principles, it must be stressed, have worked well on a mass scale
For example, this is how anarcho-syndicalist unions operate and, as was
the case with the CNT in Spain in the 1930s, worked well with over one
million members. There were also successfully applied during the Spanish
Revolution and the federations of collectives produced by it.

So the way communes and confederations are organised protect society and
the individual against the dangers of centralisation, from the turning
of delegates into representatives and bureaucrats. As Bakunin stressed,
there are two ways of organising society, *"as it is today, from high to
low and from the centre to circumference by means of enforced unity and
concentration"* and the way of the future, by federalism *"starting with
the free individual, the free association and the autonomous commune,
from low to high and from circumference to centre, by means of free
federation."* [**Michael Bakunin: Selected Writings**, p. 88] In other
words, *"the organisation of society from the bottom up."* [**The Basic
Bakunin**, p. 131] This suggests that a free society will have little to
fear in way of its delegates turning into politicians or bureaucrats as
it includes the necessary safeguards (election, mandates, recall,
decentralisation, federalism, etc.) which will reduce such developments
to a small, and so manageable, level (if not eliminate it totally).

I.5.4 How will anything ever be decided by all these meetings?
--------------------------------------------------------------

Anarchists have little doubt that the confederal structure will be an
efficient means of decision making and will not be bogged down in
endless meetings. We have various reasons for thinking this. After all,
as Murray Bookchin once noted, *"[h]istory does provide us with a number
of working examples of forms that are largely libertarian. It also
provides us with examples of confederations and leagues that made the
co-ordination of self-governing communities feasible without impinging
on their autonomy and freedom."* [**The Ecology of Freedom**, p. 436]

Firstly, we doubt that a free society will spend all its time in
assemblies or organising confederal conferences. Certain questions are
more important than others and few anarchists desire to spend all their
time in meetings. The aim of a free society is to allow individuals to
express their desires and wants freely -- they cannot do that if they
are continually at meetings (or preparing for them). So while communal
and confederal assemblies will play an important role in a free society,
do not think that they will be occurring all the time or that anarchists
desire to make meetings the focal point of individual life. Far from it!

Thus communal assemblies may occur, say, once a week, or fortnightly or
monthly in order to discuss truly important issues. There would be no
real desire to meet continuously to discuss every issue under the sun
and few people would tolerate this occurring. This would mean that such
meetings would current regularly and when important issues needed to be
discussed, **not** continuously (although, if required, continuous
assembly or daily meetings may have to be organised in emergency
situations but this would be rare). Nor is it expected that everyone
will attend every meeting for *"[w]hat is decisive, here, is the
principle itself: the freedom of the individual to participate, not the
compulsive need to do so."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 435] This suggests that
meetings will be attended by those with a specific interest in an issue
being discussed and so would be focused as a result.

Secondly, it is extremely doubtful that a free people would desire waste
vast amounts of time at such meetings. While important and essential,
communal and confederal meetings would be functional in the extreme and
not forums for hot air. It would be the case that those involved in such
meetings would quickly make their feelings known to time wasters and
those who like the sound of their own voices. Thus Cornelius
Castoriadis:

> *"It might be claimed that the problem of numbers remains and that
> people never would be able to express themselves in a reasonable
> amount of time. This is not a valid argument. There would rarely be an
> assembly over twenty people where everyone would want to speak, for
> the very good reason that when there is something to be decided upon
> there are not an infinite number of options or an infinite number of
> arguments. In unhampered rank-and-file workers' gatherings (convened,
> for instance, to decide on a strike) there have never been 'too many'
> speeches. The two or three fundamental opinions having been voiced,
> and various arguments exchanged, a decision is soon reached.*

> *"The length of speeches, moreover, often varies inversely with the
> weight of their content. Russian leaders sometimes talk on for four
> hours at Party Congresses without saying anything . . . For an account
> of the laconicism of revolutionary assemblies, see Trotsky's account
> of the Petrograd soviet of 1905 -- or accounts of the meetings of
> factory representatives in Budapest in 1956."* [**Political and Social
> Writings**, vol. 2, pp. 144-5]

As we shall see below, this was definitely the case during the Spanish
Revolution as well.

Thirdly, as these assemblies and congresses are concerned purely with
joint activity and co-ordination. Different associations and syndicates
have a functional need for co-operation and so would meet more regularly
and take action on practical activity which affects a specific section
of a community or group of communities. Not every issue that a member of
a community is interested in is necessarily best discussed at a meeting
of all members of a community or at a confederal conference. As Herbert
Read suggested, anarchism *"proposes to liquidate the bureaucracy first
by federal devolution"* and so *"hands over to the syndicates all . . .
administrative functions"* related to such things as *"transport, and
distribution, health and education."* [**Anarchy and Order**, p. 101]
Such issues will be mainly discussed in the syndicates involved and so
community discussion would be focused on important issues and themes of
general policy rather than the specific and detailed laws discussed and
implemented by politicians who know nothing about the issues or
industries at hand.

By reducing conferences to functional bodies based on concrete issues,
the problems of endless discussions can be reduced, if not totally
eliminated. In addition, as functional groups would exist outside of
these communal confederations (for example, industrial collectives would
organise conferences about their industry with invited participants from
consumer groups), there would be a limited agenda in most communal
get-togethers.

In other words, communal assemblies and conferences will have specific,
well defined agendas, and so there is little danger of "politics" (for
want of a better word!) taking up everyone's time. Hence, far from
discussing abstract laws and pointless motions on everything under the
sun and on which no one actually knows much about, the issues discussed
in these conferences will be on specific issues which are important to
those involved. In addition, the standard procedure may be to elect a
sub-group to investigate an issue and report back at a later stage with
recommendations. The conference can change, accept, or reject any
proposals. As Kropotkin argued, anarchy would be based on *"free
agreement, by exchange of letters and proposals, and by congresses at
which delegates met to discuss well specified points, and to come to an
agreement about them, but not to make laws. After the congress was over,
the delegates [would return] . . . not with a law, but with the draft of
a contract to be accepted or rejected."* [**Conquest of Bread**, p. 131]

Is this system fantasy? Given that such a system has existed and worked
at various times, we can safely argue that it is not. Obviously we
cannot cover **every** example, so we point to just two -- revolutionary
Paris and Spain.

As Murray Bookchin points out, Paris *"in the late eighteenth century
was, by the standards of that time, one of the largest and economically
most complex cities in Europe: its population approximated a million
people . . . Yet in 1793, at the height of the French Revolution, the
city was managed **institutionally** almost entirely by [48] citizen
assemblies. . . and its affairs were co-ordinated by the **Commune** ..
. and often, in fact, by the assemblies themselves, or sections as they
were called, which established their own interconnections without
recourse to the **Commune.**"* [*"Transition to the Ecological
Society"*, pp. 92-105, **Society and Nature**, no. 3, p. 96]

Here is his account of how communal self-government worked in practice:

> "What, then, were these little-know forty-eight sections of Paris . .
> . How were they organised? And how did they function?
>
> "Ideologically, the **sectionnaires** (as their members were called)

> abstraction, but the concrete reality of the people united in

> November 1792, 'every man who assumes to have sovereignty will be
> regarded as a tyrant, usurper of public liberty and worthy of death.'
>

>
> "Each section also had its own various administrative committees,

> Third Revolution**, vol. 1, p. 319]

Little wonder Kropotkin argued that these "sections" showed *"the
principles of anarchism . . . had their origin, not in theoretical
speculations, but in the **deeds** of the Great French Revolution"*
[**The Great French Revolution**, vol. 1, p. 204]

Communal self-government was also practised, and on a far wider scale,
in revolutionary Spain where workers and peasants formed communes and
federations of communes (see [section I.8](secI8.html) for fuller
details). Gaston Leval summarised the experience:

> *"There was, in the organisation set in motion by the Spanish
> Revolution and by the libertarian movement, which was its mainspring,
> a structuring from the bottom to the top, which corresponds to a real
> federation and true democracy . . . the controlling and co-ordinating

> *"The syndical assemblies were the expression and the practice of

> pp. 205-7]

These collectives organised federations embracing thousands of communes
and workplaces, whole branches of industry, hundreds of thousands of
people and whole regions of Spain. As such, it was a striking
confirmation of Proudhon's argument that under federalism *"the
sovereignty of the contracting parties . . . serves as a positive
guarantee of the liberty of . . . communes and individuals. So, no
longer do we have the abstraction of people's sovereignty . . . but an
effective sovereignty of the labouring masses."* The *"labouring masses
are actually, positively and effectively sovereign: how could they not
be when the economic organism -- labour, capital, property and assets --
belongs to them entirely . . . ?"* [**Anarchism**, vol. 1, Robert Graham
(ed.), p. 75]

In other words, it **is** possible. It **has** worked. With the massive
improvements in communication technology it is even more viable than
before. Whether or not we reach such a self-managed society depends on
whether we desire to be free or not.

I.5.5 Aren't participatory communities and confederations just new states?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

No. As we have seen in [section B.2](secB2.html), a state can be defined
both by its structure and its function. As far as structure is
concerned, a state involves the politico-military and economic
domination of a certain geographical territory by a ruling elite, based
on the delegation of power into the hands of the few, resulting in
hierarchy (centralised authority). As such, it would be a massive
theoretical error to confuse any form of social organisation with the
specific form which is the state.

As we have discussed in [section H.3.7](secH3.html#sech37), the state
has evolved its specific characteristics as a result of its function as
an instrument of class rule. If a social organisation does not have
these characteristics then it is not a state. Thus, for anarchists,
*"the essence of the state"* is *"centralised power **or to put it
another way the coercive authority** of which the state enjoys the
monopoly, in that organisation of violence know as 'government'; in the
hierarchical despotism, juridical, police and military despotism that
imposes laws on everyone."* [Luigi Fabbri, *"Anarchy and 'Scientific'
Communism"*, in **The Poverty of Statism**, pp. 13-49, Albert Meltzer
(ed.), pp. 24-5] This is why Malatesta stressed that the state *"means
the delegation of power, that is the abdication of initiative and
sovereignty of all into the hands of a few."* [**Anarchy**, p. 41] If a
social organisation is **not** centralised and top-down then it is not a
state.

In a system of federated participatory communities there is no ruling
elite, and thus no hierarchy, because power is retained by the
lowest-level units of confederation through their use of direct
democracy and mandated, rotating, and recallable delegates to confederal
bodies. This eliminates the problem in "representative" democratic
systems of the delegation of power leading to the elected officials
becoming isolated from and beyond the control of the mass of people who
elected them. An anarchist society would make decisions by *"means of
congresses, composed of delegates, who discuss among themselves, and
submit **proposals**, not **laws**, to their constituents"* [Kropotkin,
**The Conquest of Bread**, p. 135] So it is based on
**self**-government, **not** representative government (and its
inevitable bureaucracy). As Proudhon put it, *"the federal system is the
contrary of hierarchy or administrative and governmental
centralisation"* and so *"a confederation is not exactly a state . . .
What is called federal authority . . . is no longer a government; it is
an agency created . . . for the joint execution of certain functions"*.
[**The Principle of Federation**, pp. 40-1]

Perhaps it will be objected that communal decision making is just a form
of "statism" based on direct, as opposed to representative, democracy --
"statist" because the individual is still be subject to the rules of the
majority and so is not free. This objection, however, confuses statism
with free agreement (i.e. co-operation). Since participatory
communities, like productive syndicates, are voluntary associations, the
decisions they make are based on self-assumed obligations (see [section
A.2.11](secA2.html#seca211)), and dissenters can leave the association
if they so desire. Thus communes are no more "statist" than the act of
promising and keeping your word.

In addition, in a free society, dissent and direct action can be used by
minorities to press their case (or defend their freedom) as well as
debate. As Carole Pateman argues, *"[p]olitical disobedience is merely
one possible expression of the active citizenship on which a
self-managing democracy is based."* [**The Problem of Political
Obligation**, p. 162] In this way, individual liberty can be protected
in a communal system and society enriched by opposition, confrontation
and dissent. Without self-management and minority dissent, society would
become an ideological cemetery which would stifle ideas and individuals
as these thrive on discussion (*"those who will be able to create in
their mutual relations a movement and a life based on the principles of
free understanding . . . will understand that **variety, conflict even,
is life and that uniformity is death**"* [Kropotkin, **Anarchism**, p.
143]). So a society based on voluntary agreements and self-management
would, out of interpersonal empathy and self-interest, create a society
that encouraged individuality and respect for minorities.

Therefore, a commune's participatory nature is the opposite of statism.
April Carter agrees, stating that *"commitment to direct democracy or
anarchy in the socio-political sphere is incompatible with political
authority"* and that the *"only authority that can exist in a direct
democracy is the collective 'authority' vested in the body politic . . .
it is doubtful if authority can be created by a group of equals who
reach decisions be a process of mutual persuasion."* [**Authority and
Democracy**, p. 69 and p. 380] Which echoes, we must note, Proudhon's
comment that *"the true meaning of the word 'democracy'"* was the
*"dismissal of government."* [**No Gods, No Masters**, vol. 1, p. 42]
Bakunin argued that when the *"whole people govern"* then *"there will
be no one to be governed. It means that there will be no government, no
State."* [**The Political Philosophy of Bakunin**, p. 287] Malatesta,
decades later, made the same point: *"government by everybody is no
longer government in the authoritarian, historical and practical sense
of the word."* [**No Gods, No Masters**, vol. 2, p. 38] And, of course,
Kropotkin argued that by means of the directly democratic sections of
the French Revolution the masses *"practic[ed] what was to be described
later as Direct Self-Government"* and expressed *"the principles of
anarchism."* [**The Great French Revolution**, vol. 1, p. 200 and p.
204]

Anarchists argue that individuals and the institutions they create
cannot be considered in isolation. Authoritarian institutions will
create individuals who have a servile nature, who cannot govern
themselves. We, therefore, consider it common sense that individuals, in
order to be free, **must** have take part in determining the general
agreements they make with their neighbours which give form to their
communities. Otherwise, a free society could not exist and individuals
would be subject to rules others make **for** them (following orders is
hardly libertarian). Somewhat ironically, those who stress
"individualism" and denounce communes as new "states" advocate a social
system which produces extremely hierarchical social relationships based
on the authority of the property owner. In other words, abstract
individualism produces authoritarian (i.e., state-like) social
relationships (see [section F.1](secF1.html)). Therefore, anarchists
recognise the social nature of humanity and the fact any society based
on an abstract individualism (like capitalism) will be marked by
authority, injustice and inequality, **not** freedom. As Bookchin
pointed out: *"To speak of 'The Individual' apart from its social roots
is as meaningless as to speak of a society that contains no people or
institutions."* [**Anarchism, Marxism, and the Future of the Left**, p.
154]

Society cannot be avoided and *"[u]nless everyone is to be
psychologically homogeneous and society's interests so uniform in
character that dissent is simply meaningless, there must be room for
conflicting proposals, discussion, rational explication and majority
decisions - in short, democracy."* [Bookchin, **Op. Cit.**, p. 155]
Those who reject democracy in the name of liberty (such as many
supporters of capitalism claim to do) usually also see the need for laws
and hierarchical authority (particularly in the workplace). This is
unsurprising, as such authority is the only means left by which
collective activity can be co-ordinated if self-management is rejected
(which is ironic as the resulting institutions, such as a capitalist
company, are far more statist than self-managed ones).

So, far from being new states by which one section of a community
(historically, almost always a wealthy elite) imposes its ethical
standards on another, the anarchist commune is just a public forum. In
this forum, issues of community interest (for example, management of the
commons, control of communalised economic activity, and so forth) are
discussed and policy agreed upon. In addition, interests beyond a local
area are also discussed and delegates for confederal conferences are
mandated with the wishes of the community. Hence, administration of
things replaces government of people, with the community of communities
existing to ensure that the interests of all are managed by all and that
liberty, justice and equality for all are more than just ideals.
Moreover, a free society would be one without professional bodies of
armed people (i.e., there would be no armed forces or police). It would
not have the means of enforcing the decisions of conferences and
communes which reflected the interests of a few (would-be politicians or
bureaucrats) rather than popular opinion.

Of course, it could be argued that popular opinion can be as oppressive
as any state, a possibility anarchists are aware of and take steps to
combat. Remember, the communities and confederations of a free society
would be made up of free people. They would **not** be too concerned
with the personal behaviour of others unless it impacted on their own
lives. As such, they would not be seeking to restrict the liberty of
those who live with them. A community, therefore, is unlikely to make
decisions like, for example, outlawing homosexuality or censoring the
press. This is not to say that there is no danger of majorities abusing
minorities. As we discuss in the [next section](secI5.html#seci56),
anarchists suggest means of reducing it, even eliminating it. Suffice to
say, a free society would seek to encourage diversity and so leave
minorities free to live their own lives (assuming they are not
oppressing or exploiting others, of course).

For these reasons, a libertarian-socialist society would not have a
state. Structurally, it would be based on egalitarian and decentralised
institutions, the direct opposite of the hierarchical and centralised
state. Functionally, it would be based on mass participation of all to
ensure they manage their own affairs rather than, as in a state,
exclusion of the many to ensure the rule of an elite. The communes and
confederations of a libertarian system are not just states with new
names but rather the forums by which free people manage their own
affairs rather than being ruled by a state and its politicians and
bureaucrats.

This is why Proudhon argued that *"under the democratic constitution . .
. the political and the economic are . . . one and the same system . . .
based upon a single principle, mutuality . . . and form this vast
humanitarian organism of which nothing previously could give the idea .
. . [I]s this not the system of the old society turned upside down"*?
[**Anarchism**, vol. 1, Robert Graham (ed.), pp. 74-5]

I.5.6 Won't there be a danger of a *"tyranny of the majority"* under libertarian socialism?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

While the *"tyranny of the majority"* objection does contain an
important point, it is often raised for self-serving reasons. This is
because those who have historically raised the issue (for example, and
as discussed in [section B.2.5](secB2.html#secb25), creators of the 1789
American constitution like Hamilton and Madison) saw the minority to be
protected as the rich. In other words, the objection is not opposed to
majority tyranny as such (they have no objections when the majority
support their right to their riches and powers) but rather attempts of
the majority to change their society to a fairer and freer one. Such
concerns can easily be dismissed as an ingenious argument in favour of
rule by the few -- particularly as its proponents (such as the
propertarian right and other defenders of capitalism) have no problem
with the autocratic rule of property owners over their wage-slaves!

However, as noted, the objection to majority rule **does** contain a
valid point and one which anarchists have addressed -- namely, what
about minority freedom within a self-managed society? So this is a
danger, one raised by people who are most definitely **not** seeking
minority rule. For example, someone who was sympathetic to anarchism,
George Orwell, suggested:

> *"the totalitarian tendency . . . is explicit in the anarchist . . .
> vision of Society. In a Society in which there is no law, and in
> theory no compulsion, the only arbiter of behaviour is public opinion.
> But pubic opinion, because of the tremendous urge to conformity in
> gregarious animals, is less tolerant than any system of law. When
> human beings are governed by 'thou shalt not', the individual can
> practise a certain amount of eccentricity: when they are supposedly
> governed by 'love' or 'reason', he is under continuous pressure to
> make him behave and think in exactly the same way as everyone else."*
> [**Inside the Whale and Other Essays**, p. 132]

There is, of course, this danger in **any** society, be its decision
making structure direct (anarchy) or indirect (by some form of
government). However, this does not really address the issue to point
out this obvious fact. Anarchists are at the forefront in expressing
concern about it, recognising that the majority is often a threat to
freedom by its fear of change (see, for example, Emma Goldman's classic
essay *"Minorities versus Majorities"*). We are well aware that the
mass, as long as the individuals within it do not free themselves, can
be a dead-weight on others, resisting change and enforcing conformity.
As Goldman argued, *"even more than constituted authority, it is social
uniformity and sameness that harass the individual the most."* [**Red
Emma Speaks**, p. 116] Hence Malatesta's comment that anarchists *"have
the special mission of being vigilant custodians of freedom, against all
aspirants to power and against the possible tyranny of the majority."*
[**Errico Malatesta: His Life and Ideas**, p. 161]

However, rather than draw elitist conclusions from this fact of life
under capitalism and urge forms of government and organisation which
restrict popular participation (and promote rule, and tyranny, by the
few) -- as classical liberals do -- libertarians argue that only a
process of self-liberation through struggle and participation can break
up the mass into free, self-managing individuals (as discussed in
[section H.2.11](secH2.html#sech211) attempts by Leninists to portray
anarchists as elitists are both hypocritical and false). Moreover, we
also argue that participation and self-management is the only way that
majorities can come to see the point of minority ideas and for seeing
the importance of protecting minority freedoms. This means that any
attempt to restrict participation in the name of minority rights
actually enforces the herd mentality, undermining minority and
individual freedom rather than protecting it. As Carole Pateman argues:

> *"the evidence supports the arguments . . . that we do learn to
> participate by participating and that feelings of political efficacy
> are more likely to be developed in a participatory environment.
> Furthermore, the evidence indicates that experience of a participatory
> authority structure might also be effective in diminishing tendencies
> towards non-democratic attitudes in the individual."* [**Participation
> and Democratic Theory**, p. 105]

So while there is cause for concern (and anarchists are at the forefront
in expressing it), the *"tyranny of the majority"* objection fails to
take note of the vast difference between direct and representative forms
of democracy.

In the current system, as we pointed out in [section B.5](secB5.html),
voters are mere passive spectators of occasional, staged, and highly
rehearsed debates among candidates pre-selected by the corporate elite,
who pay for campaign expenses. The public is expected to choose simply
on the basis of political ads and news sound bites. Once the choice is
made, cumbersome and ineffective recall procedures insure that elected
representatives can act more or less as they (or rather, their wealthy
sponsors) please. The function, then, of the electorate in bourgeois
"representative government" is ratification of "choices" that have been
**already made for them**! This is also the case in referendum, where
the people *"are not to **propose** the questions: the government is to
do that. Only to questions **proposed** by the government, the people
may answer **Yes** or **No**, like a child in the catechism. The people
will not even have a chance to make amendments."* [Proudhon, **General
Idea of the Revolution**, p. 148]

By contrast, in a libertarian society decisions are made following
public discussion in community assemblies open to all. After decisions
have been reached, outvoted minorities -- even minorities of one --
still have ample opportunity to present reasoned and persuasive
counter-arguments to try to change the decision. This process of debate,
disagreement, challenge, and counter-challenge, which goes on even after
the defeated minority has temporarily acquiesced in the decision of the
majority, is virtually absent in the representative system, where
*"tyranny of the majority"* is truly a problem. In addition, minorities
can secede from an association if the decision reached by it are truly
offensive to them.

And let us not forget that in all likelihood, issues of personal conduct
or activity will not be discussed in the neighbourhood assemblies. Why?
Because we are talking about a society in which most people consider
themselves to be unique, free individuals, who would thus recognise and
act to protect the uniqueness and freedom of others. Unless people are
indoctrinated by religion or some other form of ideology, they can be
tolerant of others and their individuality. If this is not the case now,
then it has more to do with the existence of authoritarian social
relationships -- relationships that will be dismantled under libertarian
socialism -- and the type of person they create rather than some innate
human flaw.

Thus there will be vast areas of life in a libertarian socialist
community which are none of other people's business. Anarchists have
always stressed the importance of personal space and "private" areas.
Indeed, for Kropotkin, the failure of many "utopian" communities
directly flowed from a lack of these and *"the desire to manage the
community after the model of a family, to make it 'the great family.'
They lived all in the same house and were thus forced to continuously
meet the same 'brethren and sisters.' It is already difficult often for
two real brothers to live together in the same house, and family life is
not always harmonious; so it was a fundamental error to impose on all
the 'great family' instead of trying, on the contrary, to guarantee as
much freedom and home life to each individual."* In an anarchist
society, continual agreement on all issues is not desired. The members
of a free society *"need only agree as to some advantageous method of
common work, and are free otherwise to live in their own way."* [**Small
Communal Experiments and Why they Fail**, pp. 8-9 and p. 22]

Which brings us to another key point. When anarchists talk of
democratising or communalising the household or any other association,
we do not mean that it should be stripped of its private status and
become open to regulation by general voting in a single, universal
public sphere. Rather, we mean that households and other relationships
should take in libertarian characteristics and be consistent with the
liberty of all its members. Thus a society based on self-management does
not imply the destruction of private spheres of activity -- it implies
the extension of anarchist principles into all spheres of life, both
private and public. It does not mean the subordination of the private by
the public, or vice versa.

As an example, we can point to inter-personal relationships. Anarchists
are opposed to the patriarchy implicit (and, in the past, explicit) in
marriage and suggest free love as an alternative. As discussed in
[section H.4.2](secH4.html#sech42), free love means that both people in
a relationship have equal decision making power rather than, as in
marriage, the woman becoming the property of the husband. Thus,
self-management in this context does not mean the end of interpersonal
relationships by the imposition of the commune onto all spheres of life
but, obviously, the creation of interpersonal relationships based on
equality and liberty.

So it is highly unlikely that the *"tyranny of the majority"* will exert
itself where most rightly fear it -- in their homes, how they act with
friends, their personal space, how they act, and so on. As long as
individual freedom and rights are protected, it is of little concern
what people get up to (included the rights of children, who are also
individuals and **not** the property of their parents). Direct democracy
in anarchist theory is purely concerned with common resources, their use
and management. It is highly unlikely that a free society would debate
issues of personal behaviour or morality and instead would leave them to
those directly affected by them -- as it should be, as we all need
personal space and experimentation to find the way of life that best
suits us.

Today an authoritarian worldview, characterised by an inability to think
beyond the categories of domination and submission, is imparted by
conditioning in the family, schools, religious institutions, clubs,
fraternities, the army, etc., and produces a type of personality that is
intolerant of any individual or group perceived as threatening to the
perpetuation of that worldview and its corresponding institutions and
values. Thus, as Bakunin argued, *"public opinion"* is potentially
intolerant *"simply because hitherto this power has not been humanised
itself; it has not been humanised because the social life of which it is
ever the faithful expression is based . . . in the worship of divinity,
not on respect for humanity; in authority, not on liberty; on privilege,
not on equality; in the exploitation, not on the brotherhood, of men; on
iniquity and falsehood, not on justice and truth. Consequently its real
action, always in contradiction of the humanitarian theories which it
professes, has constantly exercised a disastrous and depraving
influence."* [**God and the State**, p. 43f] In other words, *"if
society is ever to become free, it will be so through liberated
individuals, whose free efforts make society."* [Emma Goldman,
**Anarchism and Other Essays**, p. 44] In an anarchist society a
conscious effort will be made to dissolve the institutional and
traditional sources of the authoritarian/submissive type of personality,
and thus to free "public opinion" of its current potential for
intolerance.

This is not to suggest that such a society of free individuals will not
become stuck in routine and, over time, become oppressive to minorities
who question certain aspects of public opinion or how it works. Public
opinion and social organisations can evolve over generations in ways
which no one expects. The best know, albeit fictional, example is in
Ursula Le Guin's classic science-fiction book **The Dispossessed** where
the anarchist society of Anarres has developed something of a weak
informal bureaucracy due to the routine of everyday life and the
unconscious pressures of public opinion. When the protagonist, Shevek,
and his friends try to point this out and do something about (including
Shevek leaving Anarres for the capitalist world of Urras), most on the
planet are extremely hostile to this activity (precisely because it is
going against the normal routine). Significantly, though, a large
minority end up supporting their activities, activities which can occur
precisely **because** the society is still fundamentally
communist-anarchist and so the dissenters have a rich libertarian
tradition and sensibility to base their direct action on as well having
use-rights over the resources they need to propagate their ideas and
practice their protest.

In the real world, the best example would be the **Mujeres Libres** in
the Spanish anarchist movement during the 1930s (see Martha A.
Ackelsberg's classic **Free Women Of Spain: Anarchism And The Struggle
For The Emancipation Of Women** for more on this important movement).
This organisation arose in response to the fact that many male
anarchists, while expressing a theoretical commitment to sexual
equality, were as sexist as the system they were fighting against and so
they subconsciously reflected the oppressive public opinion of what a
woman's position should be. Unsurprisingly, many anarchist women were
(rightly) angry at this and their marginalised status within a
libertarian movement that ostensibly sought to abolish all forms of
domination and hierarchy. In response, and often in the face of the
hostility or indifference of their male comrades, they organised
themselves to change this situation, to combat and transform public
opinion both within and outwith the anarchist movement. Their activities
meet with some success before, like the rest of the libertarian
revolution, it was crushed by Franco's victory in the civil war.

We can, therefore, suggest that a free society is unlikely to see public
opinion becoming authoritarian. This is because, as the example of the
**Mujeres Libres** shows, members of that society would organise to
combat such developments and use various means to raise the problem to
public awareness and to combat it. Once a free society has been gained,
the task of anarchists would be to ensure it remained free and that
would mean keeping a constant watch on possible sources of authority,
including those associated with organisations developing informal
bureaucracies and public opinion. While a free society would place
numerous safeguards against such developments, no system would be
perfect and so the actions of dissident minorities would be essential to
point out and protest as if such dangers appeared to be developing.

As such, it should be noted that anarchists recognise that the practice
of self-assumed political obligation implied in free association also
implies the right to practice dissent and disobedience as well. As
Carole Pateman notes:

> *"Even if it is impossible to be unjust to myself, I do not vote for
> myself alone, but along with everyone else. Questions about injustice
> are always appropriate in political life, for there is no guarantee
> that participatory voting will actually result in decisions in accord
> with the principles of political morality."* [**The Problem of
> Political Obligation**, p. 160]

If an individual or group of individuals feel that a specific decision
threatens their freedom (which is the basic principle of political
morality in an anarchist society) they can (and must) act to defend that
freedom:

> *"The political practice of participatory voting rests in a collective
> self-consciousness about the meaning and implication of citizenship.
> The members of the political association understand that to vote is
> simultaneously to commit oneself, to commit one's fellow citizens, and
> also to commit oneself to them in a mutual undertaking . . . a refusal
> to vote on a particular occasion indicates that the refusers believe .
> . . [that] the proposal . . . infringes the principle of political
> morality on which the political association is based . . . A refusal
> to vote [or the use of direct action] could be seen as an appeal to
> the 'sense of justice' of their fellow citizens."* [Pateman, **Op.
> Cit.**, p. 161]

As they no longer consent to the decisions made by their community they
can appeal to the "sense of justice" of their fellow citizens by direct
action and indicate that a given decision may have impacts which the
majority were not aware. Hence direct action and dissent is a key aspect
of an anarchist society and help ensure against the tyranny of the
majority. Anarchism rejects the *"love it or leave it"* attitude that
marks an authoritarian organisation.

This vision of self-assumed obligation, with its basis in individual
liberty, indicates the basic flaw of Joseph Schumpeter's argument
against democracy as anything bar a political method of arriving at
decisions (in his case who will be the leaders of a society). Schumpeter
proposed *"A Mental Experiment"* of imagining a country which, using a
democratic process, *"reached the decision to persecute religious
dissent"* (such as Jews and witches). He argued that we should not
approve of these practices just because they have been decided upon by a
majority or using a democratic method and, therefore, democracy cannot
be an end in itself. [**Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy**, pp.
240-3]

However, such systematic persecution would conflict with the rules of
procedure required if a country's or community's political method is to
be called "democratic." This is because, in order to be democratic, the
minority must be in a position for its ideas to become the majority's
via argument and that requires freedom of speech, discussion and
association. A country or community in which the majority persecutes or
represses a minority automatically ensures that the minority can never
be in a position to become the majority (as the minority is barred by
force from becoming so) or convince the majority of the errors of its
way (even if it cannot become the majority physically, it can become so
morally by convincing the majority to change its position). Schumpeter's
example utterly violates democratic principles and so cannot be squared
with the it (Rousseau's somewhat opaque distinction between *"the
General Will"* and majority rule sought to express this). Thus majority
tyranny is an outrage against both democratic theory **and** individual
liberty (unsurprisingly, as the former has its roots in the latter).

This argument applies with even more force to a self-managed community
too and so any system in which the majority tyrannises over a minority
is, by definition, **not** self-managed as one part of the community is
excluded from convincing the other (*"the enslavement of part of a
nation denies the federal principal itself."* [Proudhon, **The Principle
of Federation**, p. 42f]). Thus individual freedom and minority rights
are essential to self-management. As Proudhon argued, *"a new spirit has
dawned on the world. Freedom has opposed itself to the State, and since
the idea of freedom has become universal people have realised that it is
not a concern of the individual merely, but rather that it must exist in
the group also."* [quoted by Martin Buber, **Paths in Utopia**, p. 28]
Unsurprisingly, then, the *"freedom of the collectivity to crush the
individual is not, however, true Liberty in the eyes of Anarchists. It
is one of those shams, which the Revolution is to destroy."* [Charlotte
M. Wilson, **Anarchist Essays**, p. 25]

It should be stressed, however, that most anarchists do not think that
the way to guard against possible tyranny by the majority is to resort
to decision-making by consensus (where no action can be taken until
every person in the group agrees) or a property system (based in
contracts). Both consensus (see [section A.2.12](secA2.html#seca212))
and contracts (see [section A.2.14](secA2.html#seca214)) soon result in
authoritarian social relationships developing in the name of "liberty."
Rather, we seek new forms of free agreement to replace contract and new
forms of decision making which do not replace the possible tyranny of
the majority with the real tyranny of a minority.

Then there is freedom of association. As Malatesta argued, *"for if it
is unjust that the majority should oppress the minority, the contrary
would be quite as unjust; and if the minority has a right to rebel, the
majority has a right to defend itself . . . it is true that this
solution is not completely satisfactory. The individuals put out of the
association would be deprived of many social advantages, which an
isolated person or group must do without, because they can only be
procured by the co-operation of a great number of human beings. But what
would you have? These malcontents cannot fairly demand that the wishes
of many others should be sacrificed for their sakes."* [**A Talk about
Anarchist-Communism**, p. 29] In other words, freedom of association
means the freedom **not** to associate and so communities can expel
individuals or groups of individuals who constantly hinder community
decisions -- assuming they do not leave voluntarily and seek a community
more in tune with their needs. This a very important freedom for both
the majority and the minority, and must be defended.

So while minorities have significant rights in a free society, so does
the majority. We can imagine that there will be ethical reasons why
participants will not act in ways to oppose joint activity -- as they
took part in the decision making process they would be considered
childish if they reject the final decision because it did not go in
their favour. Moreover, they would also have to face the reaction of
those who also took part in the decision making process. It would be
likely that those who ignored such decisions (or actively hindered them)
would soon face non-violent direct action in the form of
non-co-operation, shunning, boycotting and so on. Anarchists think that
such occurrences would be rare.

As an isolated life is impossible, the need for communal associations is
essential. It is only by living together in a supportive community can
individuality be encouraged and developed along with individual freedom.
However, anarchists are aware that not everyone is a social animal and
that there are times that people like to withdraw into their own
personal space. Thus our support for free association and federalism
along with solidarity, community and self-management. Most anarchists
have recognised that majority decision making, though not perfect, is
the best way to reach decisions in a political system based on
maximising individual and so social freedom. Self-management in
grassroots confederal assemblies and workers' councils ensures that
decision making is "horizontal" in nature (i.e. between **equals**) and
not hierarchical (i.e. governmental, between order giver and order
taker). In other words, anarchists support self-management because it
ensures liberty -- **not** because we subscribe to the flawed assumption
that the majority is always right.

I.5.7 What if I don't want to join a commune?
---------------------------------------------

As would be expected, no one would be **forced** to join a commune nor
take part in its assemblies. To suggest otherwise would be contrary to
anarchist principles. Thus a commune would be a free society, in which
individual liberty would be respected and encouraged.

However, what about individuals who live within the boundaries of a
commune but decide not to join? For example, a local neighbourhood may
include households that desire to associate and a few that do not (this
is actually happened during the Spanish Revolution). What happens to the
minority of dissenters?

Obviously individuals can leave to find communities more in line with
their own concepts of right and wrong if they cannot convince their
neighbours of the validity of their ideas. And, equally obviously, not
everyone will want to leave an area they like. So we must discuss what
happens to those who decide to not to find a more suitable
neighbourhood. Are the communal decisions binding on non-members?
Obviously not. If an individual or family desire **not** to join a
commune (for whatever reason), their freedoms must be respected.
However, this also means that they cannot benefit from communal activity
and resources (such a free parks, hospitals, and so forth) and have to
pay for their use. As long as they do not exploit or oppress others, an
anarchist community would respect their decision (as discussed in
[section G.2.1](secG2.html#secg21), for example).

Many who oppose anarchist self-management in the name of freedom often
do so because they desire to oppress and exploit others. In other words,
they oppose participatory communities because they (rightly) fear that
this would restrict their ability to grow rich off the labour of others
(this type of opposition can be seen from history, when rich elites, in
the name of liberty, have replaced democratic forms of social decision
making with representative or authoritarian ones -- see [section
B.2.5](secB2.html#secb25)).

It goes without saying that the minority, as in any society, will exist
within the ethical norms of the surrounding society and they will be
have to adhere to them in the same sense that they have to adhere to not
murdering people (few sane people would say that forcing people not to
commit murder is a restriction of their liberty). Therefore, while
allowing the maximum of individual freedom of dissent, an anarchist
community would still have to apply its ethical standards to those
beyond that community. Individuals would not be allowed to murder, harm
or enslave others and claim that they are allowed to do so because they
are not part of the local community (see [section
I.5.8](secI5.html#seci58) on crime in an anarchist society).

Similarly, individuals would not be allowed to develop private property
(as opposed to possession) simply because they wanted to. This rejection
of private property would not be a restriction on liberty simply because
stopping the development of authority hardly counts as an authoritarian
act (for an analogy, supporters of capitalism do not think that banning
theft is a restriction of liberty and because this view is -- currently
-- accepted by the majority it is enforced on the minority). Regardless
of what defenders of capitalism claim, "voluntary bilateral exchanges"
affect third parties and can harm others indirectly. This can easily be
seen from examples like concentrations of wealth which have effects
across society or the ecological impacts of consumption and production.
This means that an anarchist society would be aware that inequality, and
so statism, could develop again and take precautions against it. As
Malatesta put it, some *"seem almost to believe that after having
brought down government and private property we would allow both to be
quietly built up again, because of respect for the **freedom** of those
who might feel the need to be rulers and property owners. A truly
curious way of interpreting our ideas."* [**Anarchy**, p. 43]

The suggestion that denying property ownership is a restriction in
freedom is wrong, as it is the would-be capitalist who is trying to ban
freedom for others on their property. Members of a free society would
simply refuse to recognise the claims of private property -- they would
simply ignore the would-be capitalist's pretensions and "keep out"
signs. Without a state, or hired thugs, to back up their claims, they
would just end up looking silly.

This means that Anarchists do not support the liberty of being a boss
(anarchists will happily work **with** someone but not **for** someone).
Of course, those who desire to create private property against the
wishes of others expect those others to respect **their** wishes. So,
when would-be propertarians happily fence off their "property" and
exclude others from it, could not these others remember these words from
Woody Guthrie's **This Land is Your Land**, and act accordingly?

***"As I went rumbling that dusty highway\
 I saw a sign that said private property\
 But on the other side it didn't say nothing\
 This land was made for you and me"***

While happy to exclude people from "their" property, such owners seem
more than happy to use the resources held in common by others. They are
the ultimate "free riders," desiring the benefits of society but
rejecting the responsibilities that go with it. In the end, such
"individualists" usually end up supporting the state (an institution
they claim to hate) precisely because it is the only means by which
private property and their "freedom" to exercise authority can be
defended.

This does not mean denying the freedom to live your life as you see fit,
using the resources you need to do so. It simply means not being able to
proclaim ownership over more than you could reasonably use. In other
words, *"occupancy and use"* would be the limits of possession -- and so
property would become *"that control of a thing by a person which will
receive either social sanction, or else unanimous individual sanction,
when the laws of social expediency shall have been fully discovered."*
[Benjamin Tucker, **Instead of a Book**, p. 131] As we discuss in
[section I.6.2](secI6.html#seci62), this perspective on use rights is
shared by both individualist and social anarchists.

Therefore anarchists support the maximum of experiments while ensuring
that the social conditions that allow this experimentation are protected
against concentrations of wealth and power. As Malatesta put it:
*"Anarchism involves all and only those forms of life that respect
liberty and recognise that every person has an equal right to enjoy the
good things of nature and the products of their own activity."* [**The
Anarchist Revolution**, p. 14]

So, as a way to eliminate the problem of minorities seeking power and
property for themselves, an anarchist revolution places social wealth
(starting with the land) in the hands of all and promises to protect
only those uses of it which are considered just by society as a whole.
In other words, by recognising that "property" is a product of society,
an anarchist society will ensure than an individual's "property" is
protected by his or her fellows when it is based purely upon actual
occupancy and use. Thus attempts to transform minority dissent into,
say, property rights would be fought by simply ignoring the "keep out"
signs of property owned, but not used, by an individual or group.
Therefore, individuals are free not to associate, but their claims of
"ownership" will be based around **use** rights, not property rights.
Without a state to back up and protect property "rights," we see that
all rights are, in the end, what society considers to be fair (the
difference between law and social custom is discussed in [section
I.7.3](secI7.html#seci73)). What the state does is to impose "rights"
which do not have such a basis (i.e. those that protect the property of
the elite) or "rights" which have been corrupted by wealth and would
have been changed because of this corruption had society been free to
manage its own affairs.

In summary, individuals will be free not to join a participatory
community, and hence free to place themselves outside its decisions and
activities on most issues that do not apply to the fundamental ethical
standards of a society. Hence individuals who desire to live outside of
anarchist communities would be free to live as they see fit but would
not be able to commit murder, rape, create private property or other
activities that harmed individuals. It should be noted, moreover, that
this does not mean that their possessions will be taken from them by
"society" or that "society" will tell them what to do with them.
Freedom, in a complex world, means that such individuals will not be in
a position to turn their possessions into **property** and thus recreate
capitalism (for the distinction between *"property"* and
*"possessions,"* see [section B.3.1](secB3.html#secb31)). This will not
be done by "anarchist police" or by "banning" voluntary agreements, but
purely by recognising that "property" is a social creation and by
creating a social system that will encourage individuals to stand up for
their rights and co-operate with each other to protect their freedom
against those seeking to reduce others to the conditions of servants
working their property for them.

I.5.8 What about crime?
-----------------------

For anarchists, "crime" can best be described as anti-social acts, or
behaviour which harms someone else or which invades their personal
space. Anarchists, in other words, *"believe that to act criminally
means to violate the liberty of others"* and so criminals in a free
society would be *"those who would encroach on personal integrity,
liberty and the well being of others."* [Malatesta, **At the Café**, p.
100 and p. 132]

This definition of crime is similar, of course, to that used in
capitalist society but libertarians note that the state defines as
"crime" many things which a sane society would not (such as, say,
consensual acts of adults in private or expropriation of private
property). Similarly, a free society would consider as anti-social many
acts which the state defends under capitalism (such as the appropriation
of resources or exploitation of others labour). This is to be expected,
as social customs evolve and reflect the socio-economic basis of a given
society. Hence Malatesta:

> *"Naturally the crimes we are talking about are anti-social acts, that
> is those which offend human feelings and which infringe the right of
> others to equality in freedom, and not the many actions which the
> penal code punishes simply because they offend against the privileges
> of the dominant classes."* [**Errico Malatesta: His Life and Ideas**,
> pp. 105-6]

Anarchists argue that the root cause for crime is not some perversity of
human nature or "original sin" but is due to the type of society by
which people are moulded. For example, anarchists point out that by
eliminating private property, crime could be reduced significantly,
since most crime today is currently motivated by evils stemming from
private property such as poverty, homelessness, unemployment, and
alienation. Moreover, by adopting anarchist methods of non-authoritarian
child rearing and education, most of the remaining crimes could also be
eliminated, because they are largely due to the anti-social, perverse,
and cruel "secondary drives" that develop because of authoritarian
child-rearing practices (see [section J.6](secJ6.html)). However, as
long as the few *"violates the equal freedom of others . . . we must
defend ourselves."* [Malatesta, **Op. Cit.**, p. 106]

First, it cannot be said that governments are required to protect people
from crime and criminals. Rather, as Alexander Berkman argued, *"[d]oes
not government itself create and uphold conditions which make for crime?
Does not the invasion and violence upon which all governments rest
cultivate the spirit of intolerance and persecution, of hatred and more
violence?"* Crime, then, *"is the result of economic conditions, of
social inequality, of wrongs and evils of which government and monopoly
are parents. Government and law can only punish the criminal. They
neither cure nor prevent crime. The only real cure for crime is to
abolish its causes, and the government can never do because it is there
to preserve those very causes."* This suggests that crimes *"resulting
form government, from its oppression and injustice, from inequality and
poverty, will disappear under Anarchy. These constitute by far the
greatest percentage of crime."* [**What is Anarchism?**, p. 151] Nor
should we forget that today we are subject to rule by the anti-social,
for the *"owners and rulers"* are *"criminals"* who are *"powerful and
have organised their dominance on a stable basis"* (*"Who is more of a
thief than the owners who get wealthy stealing the produce of the
workers' labour?"*). [Malatesta, **At the Café**, p. 100 and p. 130]

"Crime", therefore, cannot be divorced from the society within which it
occurs. Society, in Emma Goldman's words, gets the criminals it
deserves. For example, anarchists do not think it unusual nor unexpected
that crime exploded under the pro-free market capitalist regimes of
Thatcher and Reagan. Crime, the most obvious symptom of social crisis,
took 30 years to double in Britain (from 1 million incidents in 1950 to
2.2 million in 1979). However, between 1979 and 1992 the crime rate more
than doubled, exceeding the 5 million mark in 1992. These 13 years were
marked by a government firmly committed to the "free market" and
"individual responsibility." It was entirely predictable that the social
disruption, atomisation of individuals, and increased poverty caused by
freeing capitalism from social controls would rip society apart and
increase criminal activity. Also unsurprisingly (from an anarchist
viewpoint), under these pro-market governments we also saw a reduction
in civil liberties, increased state centralisation, and the destruction
of local government. As Malatesta put it, the classical liberalism which
these governments represented could have had no other effect, for *"the
government's powers of repression must perforce increase as free
competition results in more discord and inequality."* [**Anarchy**, p.
47]

Hence the apparent paradox of governments with flowing rhetoric about
"individual rights," the "free market" and "getting the state off our
backs" increasing state power and reducing rights while holding office
during a crime explosion is no paradox at all. *"The conjuncture of the
rhetoric of individual freedom and a vast increase in state power,"*
argues Carole Pateman, *"is not unexpected at a time when the influence
of contract doctrine is extending into the last, most intimate nooks and
crannies of social life. Taken to a conclusion, contract undermines the
conditions of its own existence. Hobbes showed long ago that contract --
all the way down -- requires absolutism and the sword to keep war at
bay."* [**The Sexual Contract**, p. 232]

Capitalism, and the contract theory on which it is built, will
inevitably rip apart society. It is based upon a vision of humanity as
isolated individuals with no connection other than that of money. Such a
vision cannot help but institutionalise anti-social acts. As Kropotkin
argued *"it is not love and not even sympathy upon which Society is
based in mankind. It is the conscience -- be it only at the stage of an
instinct -- of human solidarity. It is the unconscious recognition of
the force that is borrowed by each man [and woman] from the practice of
mutual aid; of the close dependency of every one's happiness upon the
happiness of all; and of the sense of justice, or equity, which brings
the individual to consider the rights of every other individual as equal
to his [or her] own."* [**Mutual Aid**, p. 16] The social atomisation
required and created by capitalism destroys the basic bonds of society
-- namely human solidarity -- and hierarchy crushes the individuality
required to understand that we share a common humanity with others and
so understand **why** we must be ethical and respect others rights.
Significantly, as Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett note in **The
Spirit Level: Why More Equal Societies Almost Always Do Better**, more
unequal societies have more crime and bigger prison populations
(equality, as well as reducing crime, consistently deliver other
advantages for people).

We are not saying, however, that anarchists reject the concept of
individual responsibility. While recognising that rape, for example, is
the result of a social system which represses sexuality and is based on
patriarchy (i.e. rape has more to do with power than sex), anarchists do
not "sit back" and say "it's society's fault." Individuals have to take
responsibility for their own actions and recognise that consequences of
those actions. Part of the current problem with "law codes" is that
individuals have been deprived of the responsibility for developing
their own ethical code, and so are less likely to develop "civilised"
social standards (see [section I.7.3](secI7.html#seci73)).

Therefore, while anarchists reject the ideas of law and a specialised
justice system, they are not blind to the fact that anti-social action
may not totally disappear in a free society. Nor are they blind to the
fact that, regardless of our hopes about a free society reducing crime,
we will not create it over-night (*"all the bad passions . . . will not
disappear at a stroke. There will still be for a long time those who
will feel tempted to impose their will on others with violence, who will
wish to exploit favourable circumstances to create privileges for
themselves"* [Malatesta, **At the Café**, p. 131]). Therefore, some sort
of justice system would still be necessary to deal with the remaining
crimes and to adjudicate disputes between people.

This does not, it must be stressed, signify some sort of contradiction
within anarchism. Anarchists have never advocated the kind of "freedom"
which assumes that people can do what they want. When people object to
anarchy, they often ask about those who would steal, murder, rape and so
forth and seem to assume that such people would be free to act as they
like. This is, needless to say, an utter misunderstanding of both our
ideas and freedom in general. Simply put, if people impose themselves by
force on others then *"they will be the government"* and *"we will
oppose them with force"* for *"if today we want to make a revolution
against the government, it is not in order to submit ourselves supinely
to new oppressors."* [Malatesta, **Op. Cit.**, p. 99] This applies to
defending a free society against organised counter-revolution and
against those within it conducting anti-social ("criminal") activities.
The principle is the same, it is just the scale which is different.

It should be remembered that just because the state monopolises or
organises a (public) service, it does not mean that the abolition of the
state means the abolition of what useful things it provided. For
example, many states own and run the train network but the abolition of
the state does not mean that there will no longer be any trains! In a
free society management of the railways would be done by the rail
workers themselves, in association with the community. The same applies
to anti-social behaviour and so we find Kropotkin, for example, pointing
to how *"voluntary associations"* would *"substitute themselves for the
State in all its functions,"* including *"mutual protection"* and
*"defence of the territory."* [**Anarchism**, p. 284]

This applies to what is termed justice, namely the resolution of
disputes and anti-social acts ("crime"). Anarchists argue that *"people
would not allow their wellbeing and their freedom to be attacked with
impunity, and if the necessity arose, they would take measures to defend
themselves against the anti-social activities of a few. But to do so,
what purpose is served by people whose profession is the making of laws;
while other people spend their lives seeking out and inventing
law-breakers?"* [Malatesta, **Anarchy**, pp. 43-4] This means that in a
free society the resolution of anti-social behaviour would rest in the
hands of all, **not** in a specialised body separate from and above the
masses. As Proudhon put it, an anarchy would see the *"police,
judiciary, administration, everywhere committed to the hands of the
workers"* [**General Idea of the Revolution**, p. 281] And so:

> *"Let each household, each factory, each association, each
> municipality, each district, attend to its own police, and administer
> carefully its own affairs, and the nation will be policed and
> administered. What need have we to be watched and ruled, and to pay,
> year in and year out, . . . millions? Let us abolish prefects,
> commissioners, and policemen too."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 273]

Precisely how this will work will be determined by free people based on
the circumstances they face. All we can do is sketch out likely
possibilities and make suggestions.

In terms of resolving disputes between people, it is likely that some
form of arbitration system would develop. The parties involved could
agree to hand their case to a third party (for example, a communal jury
or mutually agreed individual or individuals). There is the possibility
that the parties cannot agree (or if the victim were dead), then the
issue could be raised at a communal assembly and a "court" appointed to
look into the issue. These "courts" would be independent from the
commune, their independence strengthened by popular election instead of
executive appointment of judges, by protecting the jury system by random
selection of citizens, and so *"all disputes . . . will be submitted to
juries which will judge not only the facts but the law, the justice of
the law [or social custom], its applicability to the given
circumstances, and the penalty or damage to be inflicted because of its
infraction"*. [Benjamin Tucker, **The Individualist Anarchists**, p.
160] For Tucker, the jury was a *"splendid institution, the principal
safeguard against oppression."* [**Liberty**, vol. 1, no. 16, p. 1]

As Malatesta suggested, *"when differences were to arise between men
[sic!], would not arbitration voluntarily accepted, or pressure of
public opinion, be perhaps more likely to establish where the right lies
than through an irresponsible magistrate which has the right to
adjudicate on everything and everybody and is inevitably incompetent and
therefore unjust?"* [**Anarchy**, p. 45] It is in the arbitration system
and communal assemblies that what constitutes anti-social behaviour will
be discussed and agreed.

In terms of anti-social events when they happen, *"when there remains a
residue of criminals, the collective directly concerned should think of
placing them in a position where they can do no harm, without delegating
to anyone the specific function of persecuting criminals"* [Malatesta,
**At the Café**, p. 101] In the case of a "police force", this would not
exist either as a public or private specialised body or company. If a
local community did consider that public safety required a body of
people who could be called upon for help, we imagine that a new system
would be created. Such a system would *"not be entrusted to, as it is
today, to a special, official body: all able-bodied inhabitants will be
called upon to take turns in the security measures instituted by the
commune."* [James Guillaume, *"On Building the New Social Order"*, pp.
356-79, **Bakunin on Anarchism**, p. 371]

This system could be based around a voluntary militia, in which all
members of the community could serve if they so desired. Those who
served would not constitute a professional body; instead the service
would be made up of local people who would join for short periods of
time and be replaced if they abused their position. Hence the likelihood
that a communal militia would become corrupted by power, like the
current police force or a private security firm exercising a policing
function, would be vastly reduced. Moreover, by accustoming a population
to intervene in anti-social as part of the militia, they would be
empowered to do so when not an active part of it, so reducing the need
for its services even more. In this way *"we will defend ourselves . . .
without delegating to anyone the special function of the defence of
society"* and this is *"the only effective method"* of stopping and
reducing anti-social activity. [Malatesta, **Op. Cit.**, p. 132]

Such a body would not have a monopoly on protecting others, but would
simply be on call if required. It would no more be a monopoly of defence
(i.e. a "police force") than the current fire service is a monopoly.
Individuals are not banned from putting out fires today because the fire
service exists, similarly individuals will be free to help stop
anti-social crime by themselves, or in association with others, in an
anarchist society.

Of course there are anti-social acts which occur without witnesses and
so the "guilty" party cannot be readily identified. If such acts did
occur we can imagine an anarchist community taking two courses of
action. The injured party may look into the facts themselves or appoint
an agent to do so or, more likely, an ad hoc group would be elected at a
community assembly to investigate specific crimes of this sort (subject
to control and recall by the community). Once the investigating body
thought it had enough evidence it would inform the community as well as
the affected parties and then organise a court. Of course, a free
society will produce different solutions to such problems, solutions
no-one has considered yet and so these suggestions are just that,
suggestions.

As is often stated, prevention is better than cure. This is as true of
crime as of disease and so crime is best fought by rooting out its
**causes** as opposed to punishing those who act in response to these
causes. As Emma Goldman argued, crime *"is naught but misdirected
energy. So long as every institution of today, economic, political,
social, moral conspires to misdirect human energy into wrong channels;
so long as most people are out of place doing things they hate to do,
living a life they loathe to live, crime will be inevitable, and all the
laws on the statues can only increase, but never do away with, crime"*
[**Red Emma Speaks**, p. 71] Erich Fromm, decades later, made the same
point:

> *"It would seem that the amount of destructiveness to be found in
> individuals is proportionate to the amount to which expansiveness of
> life is curtailed. By this we do not refer to individual frustrations
> of this or that instinctive desire but to the thwarting of the whole
> of life, the blockage of spontaneity of the growth and expression of
> man's sensuous, emotional, and intellectual capacities. Life has an
> inner dynamism of its own; it tends to grow, to be expressed, to be
> lived . . . the drive for life and the drive for destruction are not
> mutually interdependent factors but are in a reversed interdependence.
> The more the drive towards life is thwarted, the stronger is the drive
> towards destruction; the more life is realised, the less is the
> strength of destructiveness. **Destructiveness is the outcome of
> unlived life.** Those individual and social conditions that make for
> suppression of life produce the passion for destruction that forms, so
> to speak, the reservoir from which particular hostile tendencies --
> either against others or against oneself -- are nourished."* [**The
> Fear of Freedom**, p. 158]

Therefore, by reorganising society so that it empowers everyone and
actively encourages the use of all our intellectual, emotional and
sensuous abilities, crime would soon cease to be the huge problem that
it is now. As for the anti-social behaviour or clashes between
individuals that might still exist in such a society, it would be dealt
with in a system based on respect for the individual and a recognition
of the social roots of the problem. Restraint would be kept to a
minimum. Anarchists think that public opinion and social pressure would
be the main means of preventing anti-social acts in an anarchist
society, with such actions as boycotting and ostracising used as
powerful sanctions to convince those attempting them of the errors of
their way. Extensive non-co-operation by neighbours, friends and work
mates would be the best means of stopping acts which harmed others. Thus
Malatesta:

> *"In order for crime to be treated rationally, in order to seek for
> its causes and really do everything possible to eliminate it, it is
> necessary for this task to be entrusted to those who are exposed to
> and suffer the consequences of crime, in other words the whole public,
> and not those to whom the existence of crime is a source of power and
> earnings."* [**At the Café**, p. 135]

An anarchist system of justice, we should note, would have a lot to
learn from aboriginal societies simply because they are examples of
social order without the state. Indeed many of the ideas we consider as
essential to justice today can be found in such societies. As Kropotkin
argued, *"when we imagine that we have made great advances in
introducing, for instance, the jury, all we have done is to return to
the institutions of the so-called 'barbarians' after having changed it
to the advantage of the ruling classes."* [**The State: Its Historic
Role**, p. 18] Like aboriginal justice (as documented by Rupert Ross in
**Returning to the Teachings: Exploring Aboriginal Justice**) anarchists
contend that justice be achieved by the teaching and healing of all
involved. Public condemnation of the wrongdoing would be a key aspect of
this process, but the wrong doer would remain part of the community and
so see the effects of their actions on others in terms of grief and pain
caused. It would be likely that wrong doers would be expected to try to
make amends for their act by community service or helping victims and
their families.

So, from a practical viewpoint, almost all anarchists oppose prisons on
both practical grounds and ethical grounds. Prisons have numerous
negative affects on society as well as often re-enforcing criminal (i.e.
anti-social) behaviour. Anarchists use the all-to-accurate description
of prisons as *"Universities of Crime"* wherein the first-time criminal
learns new techniques and have adapt to the prevailing ethical standards
within them. Hence, prisons would have the effect of increasing the
criminal tendencies of those sent there and so prove to be
counter-productive. In addition, prisons do not affect the social
conditions which promote many forms of crime. Simply put, prison *"does
not improve the prisoner . . . it does not prevent him from committing
more crimes. It does not then achieve any of the ends it has set
itself"* [Kropotkin, **Anarchism**, p. 228] Moreover, they are a failure
in terms of their impact on those subject to them: *"We know what
prisons mean -- they mean broken down body and spirit, degradation,
consumption, insanity"*. [Voltairine de Cleyre, quoted by Paul Avrich,
**An American Anarchist**, p. 146] The Makhnovists took the usual
anarchist position on prisons:

> *"Prisons are the symbol of the servitude of the people, they are
> always built only to subjugate the people, the workers and peasants .
> . . Free people have no use for prisons. Wherever prisons exist, the
> people are not free . . . In keeping with this attitude, [the
> Makhnovists] demolished prisons wherever they went."* [Peter Arshinov,
> **The History of the Makhnovist Movement**, p. 153]

With the exception of Benjamin Tucker, no major anarchist writer
supported the institution. Few anarchists think that private prisons
(like private policemen) are compatible with their notions of freedom.
However, all anarchists are against the current "justice" system which
seems to them to be organised around **revenge** and punishing effects
and not fixing causes.

However, there are psychopaths and other people in any society who are
too dangerous to be allowed to walk freely. Restraint in this case would
be the only option and such people may have to be isolated from others
for their own, and others, safety. Perhaps mental hospitals would be
used, or an area quarantined for their use created (perhaps an island,
for example). However, such cases (we hope) would be rare and *"should
be cared for according to the most humane methods of treating the
mentally afflicted."* [Voltairine de Cleyre, **The Voltairine de Cleyre
Reader**, p. 160]

The one thing that needs to be avoided is the creation of a professional
and specialised "justice" system as this would be a key means by which
the state could reconstitute itself. As Malatesta explained, *"the major
damage caused by crime is not so much the single and transitory instance
of the violation of the rights of a few individuals, but the danger that
it will serve as an opportunity and pretext for the constitution of an
authority that, with the outward appearance of defending society will
subdue and oppress it."* In other words, it *"would truly be a great
piece of foolishness to protect oneself from a few violent people, a few
idlers and some degenerates, by opening a school for idleness and
violence"* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 101 and p. 132] The libertarian perspective
on crime does not rest on an idealised vision of people. *"We do not
believe"*, as Malatesta suggested, *"in the infallibility, nor even the
general goodness of the masses"*, rather *"we believe even less in the
infallibility and goodness of those who seize power and legislate"* and
so we must *"avoid the creation of bodies specialising in police work"*.
[**Errico Malatesta: His Life and Ideas**, p. 109 and p. 108] As George
Barrett argued:

> [**Objections to Anarchism**, pp. 349-50]

So instead of prisons and a legal code based on the concept of
punishment and revenge, anarchists support the use of pubic opinion and
pressure to stop anti-social acts and the need to therapeutically
rehabilitate those who commit them. Rather than a parasitic legal system
which creates and defends inequality and privilege, anarchists agree
with Kropotkin: *"Liberty, equality, and practical human sympathy are
the most effective barriers we can oppose to the anti-social instinct of
certain among us"*. [**Op. Cit.**, p. 218] *"We want justice, not rigid,
but elastic"*, argued Tucker, *"we want justice, not stern, but tempered
with mercy, with eyes sharp enough to detect causes, conditions, and
circumstances; we want justice, not superficial, but profound."* The
current system of rigid law imposed by the state and implemented by a
judge was false and *"no such justice is wanted in any civilised
community."* [**Op. Cit.**, Vol. 13, No. 5, p. 4]

In summary, then, anarchists have spent considerable time discussing the
issue. Somewhat ironically, given that many think the issue of crime is
the weakest point of the anarchist case, the outlines of a solution to
this problem are well established in anarchist theory, both in terms of
what **not** to do and in terms of combating both crime and its causes.
Anarchy is based on people being free but freedom does **not** mean the
"freedom" to violate the equal freedom of others. That is oppression,
that is exploitation, that is the embryo of the state and capitalism.

We can recommend the section *"Crime and Punishment"* by Malatesta
(**Errico Malatesta: His Life and Ideas**) as well as Kropotkin's essays
*"Law and Authority"* and *"Prisons and their moral influence on
prisoners"* (both within the **Anarchism** collection). Emma Goldman's
*"Prisons: A social crime and Failure"* (**Red Emma Speaks**), de
Cleyre's *"Crime and Punishment"* (**The Voltairine de Cleyre Reader**)
and Colin Ward's *"How Deviant Dare you get?"* (**Anarchy in Action**)
are also worth reading. A useful collection of writings on this issue
are found in **Under the Yoke of the State: Selected Anarchist Responses
to Prisons and Crime** (edited by the Dawn Collective).

I.5.9 What about Freedom of Speech under Anarchism?
---------------------------------------------------

Free speech in an anarchist society would be far greater than under
capitalism. This is obvious, anarchists argue, because we *"fight
against oppression and tyranny for a future in which they will be
neither masters nor slaves, neither rich nor poor, neither oppressors
nor oppressed . . . the freedom of each is rooted in the freedom of all,
and that in this universal freedom is the guarantee of liberty,
self-development, autonomy, and free speech for each and everyone."*
[Emma Goldman, **A Documentary History of the American Years**, p. 104]
As such, libertarian socialism would be marked by extensive freedom of
speech but also freedom of the press, of the media and so forth.

Some, however, express the idea that **all** forms of socialism would
endanger freedom of speech, press, and so forth. The usual formulation
of this argument is in relation to state socialism and goes as follows:
if the state (or "society") owned all the means of communication, then
only the views which the government supported would get access to the
media.

This is an important point and it needs to be addressed. However, before
doing so, we should point out that under capitalism the major media are
effectively controlled by the wealthy. As we argued in [section
D.3](secD3.html), the media are **not** the independent defenders of
freedom that they like to portray themselves as. This is hardly
surprising, since newspapers, television companies, and so forth are
capitalist enterprises owned by the wealthy and with managing directors
and editors who are also wealthy individuals with a vested interest in
the status quo. Hence there are institutional factors which ensure that
the "free press" reflects the interests of capitalist elites.

However, in democratic capitalist states there is little overt
censorship. Radical and independent publishers can still print their
papers and books without state intervention (although market forces
ensure that this activity can be difficult and financially unrewarding).
Under socialism, it is argued, because "society" owns the means of
communication and production, this liberty will not exist. Instead, as
can be seen from all examples of "actually existing socialism," such
liberty is crushed in favour of the ruling elites' point of view.

As anarchism rejects the state, we can say that this danger does not
exist under libertarian socialism. However, since social anarchists
argue for the communalisation of production, could not restrictions on
free speech still exist? We argue no, for three reasons.

Firstly, publishing houses, radio stations, and so on will be run by
their workers directly. They will be supplied by other syndicates, with
whom they will make agreements, and **not** by "central planning"
officials (who would not exist). In other words, there is no bureaucracy
of officials allocating (and so controlling) resources and so the means
of communication. Hence, anarchist self-management will ensure that
there is a wide range of opinions in different magazines and papers.
There would be community papers, radio stations, etc., and obviously
they would play an increased role in a free society. But they would not
be the only media. Associations, political parties, industrial
syndicates, and so on would have their own media and/or would have
access to the resources run by communication workers syndicates, so
ensuring that a wide range of opinions can be expressed.

Secondly, the "ultimate" power in a free society will be the individuals
of which it is composed. This power will be expressed in communal and
workplace assemblies that can recall delegates and revoke their
decisions. It is doubtful that these assemblies would tolerate a set of
would-be bureaucrats determining what they can or cannot read, see, or
hear.

Thirdly, individuals in a free society would be interested in hearing
different viewpoints and discussing them. This is the natural
side-effect of critical thought (which self-management would encourage),
and so they would have a vested interest in defending the widest
possible access to different forms of media for different views. Having
no vested interests to defend, a free society would hardly encourage or
tolerate the censorship associated with the capitalist media (*"I listen
to criticism because I am **greedy.** I listen to criticism because I am
**selfish.** I would not deny myself another's insights"* [For
Ourselves, **The Right to be Greedy**, Thesis 113]).

Therefore, anarchism will **increase** freedom of speech in many
important ways, particularly in the workplace (where it is currently
denied under capitalism). This will be a natural result of a society
based on maximising freedom and the desire to enjoy life: *"We claim the
right of discussing . . . whatever subject interests us. If free speech
and free press mean anything, they mean freedom of discussion."*
[Goldman, **Op. Cit.**, p. 203]

We would also like to point out that during both the Spanish and Russian
revolutions, freedom of speech was protected within anarchist areas. For
example, the Makhnovists in the Ukraine *"fully applied the
revolutionary principles of freedom of speech, of thought, of the Press,
and of political association. In all the cities and towns occupied . . .
Complete freedom of speech, Press, assembly, and association of any kind
and for everyone was immediately proclaimed."* [Peter Arshinov, **The
History of the Makhnovist Movement**, p. 153] This is confirmed by
Michael Malet: *"One of the most remarkable achievements of the
Makhnovists was to preserve a freedom of speech more extensive than any
of their opponents."* [**Nestor Makhno in the Russian Civil War**, p.
175] In revolutionary Spain republicans, liberals, communists,
Trotskyites and many different anarchist groups all had freedom to
express their views. *"On my first visit to Spain in September 1936,"*
Emma Goldman reported *"nothing surprised me so much as the amount of
political freedom I found everywhere. True, it did not extend to
Fascists"* but *"everyone of the anti-Fascist front enjoyed political
freedom which hardly existed in any of the so-called European
democracies."* As for the few restrictions that were in place, remember
that there was a war on so it was *"childish to expect the CNT-FAI to
include Fascists and other forces engaged in their destruction in the
extension of complete political freedom."* [**Vision on Fire**, p.147
and p. 228] The freedom of speech in anarchist areas is confirmed in a
host of other eye-witnesses, including George Orwell in **Homage to
Catalonia** (in fact, it was the rise of the pro-capitalist republicans
and communists that introduced censorship). Both movements were fighting
a life-and-death struggle against communist, fascist and pro-capitalist
armies and so this defence of freedom of expression, given the
circumstances, is particularly noteworthy.

Freedom of speech, like freedom of association, applies to all groups
(including, of course, religious ones). The only exception would be, as
Goldman noted, for organisations which are actively fighting to enslave
a free society. In other words, during a social revolution it is
unlikely that freedom of speech and organisation would apply to those
supporting the counter-revolutionary forces. As the threat of violence
by these forces decreases, so the freedom of their supporters would
increase.

It is in this context we must discuss what some could point to as an
example of anarchists denying freedom of speech and association, namely
the burning of churches during the Spanish Revolution. In fact, some
would use this as evidence of anarchist intolerance of religion and to
those who disagree with them. Anarchists reject such charges.

As is well known, after the successful defeat of the fascist-military
coup in mid-July 1936, Catholic Churches were burned and members of the
Catholic Church were killed. However, these acts were **not** acts
against freedom of religion or speech. Rather they are popular acts
against both the oppressive and reactionary role of the Catholic Church
in Spanish society as well as its active support for fascism throughout
the 1920s and 1930s, including Franco's coup. As historian Paul Preston
summarises:

> *"religion was an issue which could be used to mobilise mass peasant
> support behind the interests of the oligarchy. Having lost the
> political hegemony in April 1931, the ruling classes clung all the
> more to the Church as one of the key redoubts of their social and
> economic dominance. Equally, the Church hierarchy, as a major
> landowner, had a somewhat similar view of the value of an alliance
> with the new political formation being created to defend oligarchical
> agrarian interests. Not surprisingly, throughout the Republic, the
> clergy used both pulpit and confessional to defend the existing
> socio-economic order and to make electoral propaganda for the
> successive political organisations of the Right."* [**The Coming of
> the Spanish Civil War**, pp. 42-3]

The Catholic Church *"was the bulwark of the country's conservative
forces"* and no more than 15 days after the announcement of the Republic
in 1931, the Primate of Spain *"issued a pastoral denouncing the new
government's intention to establish freedom of worship and to separate
Church and state. The cardinal urged Catholics to vote in future
elections against an administration which in his view wanted to destroy
religion."* [Antony Beevor, **The Battle for Spain**, p. 91 and p. 25]
This opposition to the Republic and support for right-wing, near-fascist
parties such as the CEDA, continued throughout the 1930s and climaxed
with the Church's backing of Franco's coup.

Nor should it be forgotten that the *"Catholic press applauded the Nazi
destruction of the German Socialist and Communist movements. Nazism was
much admired on the Spanish Right because of its emphasis on authority,
the fatherland and hierarchy -- all three of which were central
preoccupations of CEDA."* It also *"urged its readers to follow the
example of Italy and Germany and organise against the dragon of
revolution"* while the Nazis *"signed a concordat with the Vatican"*.
The CEDA would *"proceed to the establishment of an authoritarian regime
of semi-fascist character along Austrian lines"*. So awareness of what
had happened in Italy and Germany (with Church support) was keen in
anarchist and other left-wing circles, particularly as the *"Spanish
Right had not hidden its sympathy for the achievements of Hitler and
Mussolini. The CEDA had many of the trappings of a fascist
organisation"* and its leader *"had declared his determination to
establish a corporative state in Spain."* [**Op. Cit.** p. 69, p. 72, p.
120 and p. 121] As one Catholic writer, Francois Mauriac, put it
*"Christianity and fascism have become intermingled, and [many] cannot
hate one without hating the other."* [quoted Antony Beevor, **Op.
Cit.**, p. 270]

Given all this, the attacks on the Catholic Church really comes as no
surprise. If, after an attempted fascist coup, people burned down the
offices of the fascist and pro-fascist parties few people would be
surprised. Why should a pro-fascist church be considered immune to such
popular anger? As George Orwell pointed out:

*"No one can blame [someone] for being angry when churches are burned
and priests murdered or driven into exile. But I think it is a pity that
he has not looked more deeply into the reasons why these things
happen."* [**Orwell in Spain**, p. 314]

Unsurprisingly, then, those priests who had not supported the right,
those who had treated the working class the same as the rich, were
spared. In the Basque Country, where the church supported the Republic,
not a single church was burnt. Nor were synagogues or Protestant church
targeted. In Barcelona *"the Quakers established canteens which were
staffed by refugee women."* [Gabriel Jackson, **The Spanish Republic and
the Civil War, 1931-1939**, p. 446]

It should also be stressed that the repression in the fascist zone was
much worse than that in the Republican one. Of a ecclesiastical
community of 115,000, 6,845 were killed (*"the vast majority during the
summer of 1936"*). This is in stark contrast to right-wing claims at the
time. It should be mentioned that in the province of Seville, the
fascist repression killed 8,000 during 1936 alone. In Cordoba, 10,000
were killed during the war -- a tenth of the population. Once an area
was captured by nationalist forces, after the initial killing of
captured troops, union and party leaders, a *"second and more intense
wave of slaughter would begin"* (*"in fact anyone who was even suspected
of having voted for the Popular Front was in danger"*). This was
organised by *"local committees, usually consisting of leading
right-wingers, such as the major landowner, the local Civil Guard
commander, a Falangist and quite often the priest"*. This was *"clearly
not just a question of revenge, they were also motivated by the idea of
establishing a reign of terror"*. This did not, of course, hinder *"the
unqualified backing of the Vatican and the Spanish Church for General
Franco"* while *"the Catholic press abroad sprang to the support of the
nationalist rising"*. Obviously killing (many, many more) left-wingers
in the name of god is of no concern to the Catholic hierarchy nor did it
stop *"the Church's official support for Franco"*. [Beevor, **Op.
Cit.**, p. 92, p. 101, p. 99, p. 104, p. 250, p. 269 and p. 270]

Under Franco, everyone had to *"submit themselves to the authority of
the Church as well as to their temporal masters. Franco had been
extremely generous in restoring all the Church's privileges and wealth,
as well as its power in education, but in return he expected the
priesthood to act virtually as another arm of the state."* In other
words, *"Nationalist Spain was little more than an open prison for all
those who did not sympathise with the regime"* and the *"population was
encouraged to accuse people as part of its patriotic duty. Concierges
and caretakers became police spies . . . and priests noted those who did
not turn up to mass."* [Beevor, **Op. Cit.**, p. 452, p. 453 and p. 454]
All with the firm support of the Catholic Church.

Rather than an attempt to repress religion as such, the attacks on the
Catholic Church in republican areas it was a product of popular
hostility to a corrupt institution, one which was deeply reactionary,
pro-fascist and a major landowner in its own right. This means that an
awareness of the nature and role of the Church *"does not leave much
doubt as to why practically all the churches in Catalonia and eastern
Aragon were burnt at the outbreak of war."* The anti-clerical movement
was a *"popular movement and a native Spanish movement. It has its roots
not in Marx or Bakunin, but in the condition of the Spanish people
themselves."* [Orwell, **Op. Cit.**, p. 300 and p. 315] While under
Franco *"the relentless purging of 'reds and atheists' was to continue
for years"* in the Republican areas *"the worse of the violence was
mainly a sudden and quickly spent reaction of suppressed fear,
exacerbated by desires of revenge for the past."* [Beevor, **Op. Cit.**,
p. 91]

So the burning of churches in Spain had very little to do with anarchist
atheism and much, much more to do with the Catholic Church's social role
in Spain, its reactionary position, its hatred of the unions and social
protest and the fact it supported the fascist coup. It does not imply an
opposition to freedom of speech by libertarian socialists but was rather
an expression of popular opposition to a ruling class and pro-fascist
organisation.

One last point to make on this issue. Given the actual role of the
Church during this period and its wholehearted support for fascism in
the 1920s onwards, it seems strange that the Catholic church has
declared the murdered priests in Spain to be martyrs, part of a planned
religious persecution. This is not true, if they were martyrs then they
were martyrs to their pro-fascist politics and not their faith (*"The
political role of the Church was ignored when the religious victims were
made into martyrs"*). Significantly, the Catholic Church *"said nothing
when the nationalists shot sixteen of the Basque clergy, including the
arch-priest of Mondragon"* (the nationalists also killed some twenty
Protestant ministers). In 2003 when John Paul II beatified a teacher
killed in July 1936 he *"still made no mention of the Basque priests
killed by the nationalists."* [Beevor, **Op. Cit.**, p. 270, p. 92 and
p. 527] Clearly a priest being murdered by fascists backed by the
Vatican is ineligible for sainthood.

Given the actual role of the Catholic Church during this period it is
surprising the Catholic hierarchy would seek to bring attention to it.
Perhaps it is confidant that the media will not mention these awkward
facts, although this context explains the deaths and church-burning in
1936. As we noted in [section A.2.18](secA2.html#seca218), it appears
that killing working class people is not worthy of comment but
assassinating members of the ruling elite (and its servants) is. So the
fact that the burning of churches and killing of clergy is well known
but the pro-fascist activities of the church (a product of both its
reactionary politics and position in the ruling elite) which provoked it
is not should come as no surprise.

In summary, then, a free society would have substantial freedom of
speech along with other fundamental freedoms (including freedom of
worship and of association). Such freedoms would be respected, supported
and encouraged for all shades of political opinion, from the left
through to the right. The only exception would be if an organisation
were **actively** supporting those seeking to impose their rule on a
free people and in such cases some restrictions may be decided upon
(their nature would depend on the state of the struggle, with them
decreasing as the danger decreased).

To those who claim that refusing freedom of speech to
counter-revolutionaries equates to statism or implies a contradiction in
libertarian ideas, anarchists would reply that such arguments are
flawed. In terms of the former, it is equating state imposed censorship
with the active disobedience of a free people. Rather than the
government imposing a ban, members of a free society would simply
discuss the issue at hand and, if considered appropriate, actively and
collectively boycott those supporting attempts to enslave them. Without
electricity, paper, distribution networks and so on, reactionaries would
find it hard to publish or broadcast. As for the latter, there is no
contradiction as it is hardly contradictory to support and encourage
freedom while, at the same time, resisting attempts to enslave you! As
such, this suggestion makes the same logical error Engels made in his
diatribe against anarchism, namely considering it "authoritarian" to
destroy authority (see [section H.4.7](secH4.html#sech47)). Similarly,
it is hardly authoritarian to resist those seeking to impose their
authority on you or their supporters! This perspective seems to assume
that the true "libertarian" approach is to let others impose their rule
on you as stopping them is "authoritarian"! A truly strange way of
understanding our ideas....

To conclude, based upon both theory and practice, we can say that
anarchism will not endanger freedom of expression. Indeed, by breaking
up the capitalist oligopoly which currently exists and introducing
workers' self-management of the media, a far wider range of opinions
will become available in a free society. Rather than reflect the
interests of a wealthy elite, the media would reflect the interests of
society as a whole and the individuals and groups within it.

I.5.10 What about political parties, interest groups and professional bodies?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Political parties and other interest groups will exist in an anarchist
society as long as people feel the need to join them. They will not be
banned in any way, and their members will have the same rights as
everyone else. Individuals who are members of political parties or
associations can take part in communal and other assemblies and try to
convince others of the soundness of their ideas.

However, there is a key difference between such activity and politics
under a capitalist democracy. This is because the elections to positions
of responsibility in an anarchist society will not be based on party
tickets nor will it involve the delegation of power. Emile Pouget's
description of the difference between the syndicalist union and
political elections drives this difference home:

> *"The constituent part of the trade union is the individual. Except
> that the union member is spared the depressing phenomenon manifest in
> democratic circles where, thanks to the veneration of universal
> suffrage, the trend is towards the crushing and diminution of the
> human personality. In a democratic setting, the elector can avail of
> his [or her] will only in order to perform an act of abdication: his
> role is to 'award' his 'vote' to the candidate whom he [or she] wishes
> to have as his [or her] 'representative.'*

> *"Affiliation to the trade union has no such implication . . . In
> joining the union, the worker merely enters into a contract -- which
> he may at any time abjure -- with comrades who are his equals in will
> and potential . . . In the union, say, should it come to the
> appointment of a trade union council to take charge of administrative
> matters, such 'selection' is not to be compared with 'election': the
> form of voting customarily employed in such circumstances is merely a
> means whereby the labour can be divided and is not accompanied by any
> delegation of authority. The strictly prescribed duties of the trade

> entrusted to it, without ever overruling its principals, without
> supplanting them or acting in their place.*

> *"The same might be said of all decisions reached in the union: all
> are restricted to a definite and specific act, whereas in democracy,
> election implies that the elected candidate has been issued by his [or
> her] elector with a carte blanche empowering him [or her] to decide

> *"So there cannot be any possible parallels, let alone confusion,
> between trade union activity and participation in the disappointing
> chores of politics."* [**No Gods, No Masters**, vol. 2, pp. 67-68]

In other words, when individuals are elected to administrative posts
they are elected to carry out their mandate, **not** to carry out their
party's programme. Of course, if the individuals in question had
convinced their fellow workers and citizens that their programme was
correct, then this mandate and the programme would be identical. However
this is unlikely in practice. We would imagine that the decisions of
collectives and communes would reflect the complex social interactions
and diverse political opinions their members and of the various
groupings within the association.

Anarchism will likely contain many different political groupings and
ideas. The relative influence of these within collectives and communes
would reflect the strength of their arguments and the relevance of their
ideas, as would be expected in a free society. As Bakunin argued: *"The
abolition of this mutual influence would be death. And when we vindicate
the freedom of the masses, we are by no means suggesting the abolition
of any of the natural influences that individuals or groups of
individuals exert on them. What we want is the abolition of influences
which are artificial, privileged, legal, official."* [quoted by
Malatesta, **Anarchy**, p. 51] It is only when representative government
replaces self-management that political debate results in "elected
dictatorship" and centralisation of power into the hands of one party
which claims to speak for the whole of society, as if the latter had one
mind.

This freedom of political association has existed in every anarchist
revolution. During the Russian Revolution, the Makhnovists organised
soviets and regional congresses at every opportunity and these saw
delegates elected who were members of different political parties. For
example, members of the socialist Left-SR party were active in the
Makhnovist movement and attended soviet congresses (for example, the
resolution of the February 1919 congress *"was written by the
anarchists, left Socialist Revolutionaries, and the chairman."* [Michael
Palij, **The Anarchism of Nestor Makhno, 1918-1921**, p. 155]). The
Makhnovist Revolutionary Military Soviet created at the Aleksandrovsk
congress in late 1919 had three Communists elected to it while there
were 18 delegates from workers at that congress, six being Mensheviks
and the remaining 12 included Communists [Micheal Malet, **Nestor Makhno
in the Russian Civil War**, p. 111 and p. 124] In the words of the
Makhnovist reply to Bolshevik attempt to ban one of their congresses:

> *"The Revolutionary Military Council . . . holds itself above the
> pressure and influence of all parties and only recognises the people
> who elected it. Its duty is to accomplish what the people have
> instructed it to do, and to create no obstacles to any left socialist
> party in the propagation of ideas. Consequently, if one day the
> Bolshevik idea succeeds among the workers, the Revolutionary Military
> Council . . . will necessarily be replaced by another organisation,
> 'more revolutionary' and more Bolshevik."* [quoted by Peter Arshinov,
> **The History of the Makhnovist Movement**, pp. 103-4]

As such, the Makhnovists supported the right of working-class
self-determination, as expressed by one delegate to a conference in
February 1919:

> *"No party has a right to usurp governmental power into its hands . .
> . We want life, all problems, to be decided locally, not by order from
> any authority above; and all peasants and workers should decide their
> own fate, while those elected should only carry out the toilers'
> wish."* [quoted by Palij, **Op. Cit.**, p. 154]

It should be mentioned that a myth has sprung up fostered by some
Leninists that parties were banned from election to these bodies (for
example, see Jason Yanowitz’s terrible *"On the Makhno Myth"*
[**International Socialist Review**, no. 53]). These claims flow from
basic ignorance of how the soviets were organised during the revolution
combined with a misunderstanding of this Makhnovist proclamation from
January 1920:

> *"Only workers participating in work vital to the people's economy
> should be elected to these soviets. The representatives of political
> organisations have no place in the soviets of workers and peasants
> given that their participation in a soviet could turn it into a soviet
> of party political deputies, thereby leading the soviet order to
> perdition."* [quoted by Alexandre Skirda, **Nestor Makhno: Anarchy's
> Cossack**, p. 164]

When the soviets were formed in Petrograd and other Russian cities in
1917 the initiative had come (unlike in 1905) from political parties and
these ensured that they had representatives from political parties
within their executive committees (as distinct from elected delegates
who happened to be members of a political party). This was how, for
example, *"high party leaders became voting delegates"* in the soviets,
by being *"selected by the leadership of each political organisation,
and not by the soviet assembly itself."* [Samuel Farber, **Before
Stalinism**, p. 31] Thus the Makhnovists were rejecting the means by
which many soviet members were not directly elected by actual workers.

In addition, the Makhnovists were following the Russian
Anarcho-Syndicalists who argued for *"effective soviets organised on
collective lines with the direct delegation of workers and peasants . .
. and not political chatterboxes gaining entry through party lists and
turning the soviets into talking-shops"*. [**The Anarchists in the
Russian Revolution**, Paul Avrich (ed.), p. 118] This use of party lists
meant that soviet delegates could be anyone. For example, the leading
left-wing Menshevik Martov recounted that in early 1920 a chemical
factory *"put up Lenin against me as a candidate [to the Moscow soviet].
I received seventy-six votes he - eight (in an open vote)."* [quoted by
Israel Getzler, **Martov**, p. 202] How would either of these two
intellectuals actually know and reflect the concerns and interests of
the workers they would be "delegates" of? If the soviets were meant to
be the delegates of working people, then why should non-working class
members of political parties be elected as mandated and recallable
delegates to a soviet from a workplace they have never visited except,
perhaps, to gather votes?

This applies, needless to say, to other areas of life. Anarchists do not
think that social life can be reduced to political and economic
associations alone. Individuals have many different interests and
desires which they must express in order to have a truly free and
fulfilling life. Therefore an anarchist society will see the development
of numerous voluntary associations and groups to express these
interests. For example, there would be consumer groups, musical groups,
scientific associations, art associations, clubs, housing co-operatives
and associations, craft and hobby guilds, fan clubs, animal rights
associations, groups based around gender, sexuality, creed and colour
and so forth. Associations will be created for all human interests and
activities. As Kropotkin argued:

> *"He who wishes for a grand piano will enter the association of
> musical instrument makers. And by giving the association part of his
> half-days' leisure, he will soon possess the piano of his dreams. If
> he is fond of astronomical studies he will join the association of
> astronomers . . . and he will have the telescope he desires by taking
> his share of the associated work . . . In short, the five or seven
> hours a day which each will have at his disposal, after having
> consecrated several hours to the production of necessities, would
> amply suffice to satisfy all longings for luxury, however varied.
> Thousands of associations would undertake to supply them."* [**The
> Conquest of Bread**, p. 120]

We can imagine, therefore, an anarchist society being based around
associations and interest groups on every subject which fires the
imagination of individuals and for which individuals want to meet in
order to express and further their interests. Housing associations, for
example, would exist to allow inhabitants to manage their local areas,
design and maintain their homes and local parks and gardens. Vegetarian
groups would produce information on issues they consider important,
trying to convince others of the errors of eating meat. Consumer groups
would be in dialogue with syndicates about improving products and
services, ensuring that syndicates produce what is required by
consumers. Environment groups would exist to watch production and make
sure that it is not creating damaging side effects and informing both
syndicates and communes of their findings. Feminist, homosexual,
bisexual and anti-racist groups would exist to put their ideas across,
highlighting areas in which social hierarchies and prejudice still
existed. All across society, people would be associating together to
express themselves and convince others of their ideas on all kinds of
issues.

This applies to professional groupings who would seek to ensure that
those work tasks that require qualifications to do (medicine and such
like) have recognised standards and certificates. In this way, others in
society would know whether a fellow worker is a recognised expert in
their field and has the appropriate qualifications to do the work
required or give advice. While a free society would break down the line
between intellectual and manual work, ensure the end of the division of
labour, the fact remains that people will wish to be happy that the
doctor or nurse they are visiting knows what they are doing. This is
where professional groupings would come into play, organising training
and certification based on mutually agreed standards and qualifications.
This would not stop others seeking to practice such tasks, of course,
but it will mean that few, if any, would frequent someone without the
recognised professional standards.

Hence in a anarchist society, free association would take on a stronger
and more positive role than under capitalism. In this way, social life
would take on many dimensions, and the individual would have the choice
of thousands of societies to join to meet his or her interests or create
new ones with other like-minded people. Anarchists would be the last to
deny that there is more to life than work!

I.5.11 How will an anarchist society defend itself against the power hungry?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

A common objection to anarchism is that a libertarian society will be
vulnerable to be taken over by thugs or those who seek power. A similar
argument is that a group without a leadership structure becomes open to
charismatic leaders so anarchy would just lead to tyranny.

For anarchists, such arguments are strange. Society already **is** run
by thugs and/or the off-spring of thugs. Kings were originally just
successful thugs who imposed their domination over a specific
territorial area. The modern state has evolved from the structure
created to impose this domination. Similarly with property, with most
legal titles to land being traced back to its violent seizure by thugs
who then passed it on to their children who then sold it or gave it to
their offspring. The origins of the current system in violence can be
seen by the continued use of violence by the state and capitalists to
enforce and protect their domination over society. When push comes to
shove, the dominant class will happily re-discover their thug past and
employ extreme violence to maintain their privileges. The descent of
large parts of Europe into Fascism in the 1920s and 1930s, or Pinochet's
coup in Chile in 1973 indicates how far they will go. As Peter Arshinov
argued (in a slightly different context):

> *"Statists fear free people. They claim that without authority people
> will lose the anchor of sociability, will dissipate themselves, and
> will return to savagery. This is obviously rubbish. It is taken
> seriously by idlers, lovers of authority and of the labour of others,
> or by blind thinkers of bourgeois society. The liberation of the
> people in reality leads to the degeneration and return to savagery,
> not of the people, but of those who, thanks to power and privilege,
> live from the labour of the people's arms and from the blood of the
> people's veins . . . The liberation of the people leads to the
> savagery of those who live from its enslavement."* [**The History of
> the Makhnovist Movement**, p. 85]

So anarchists are not impressed with the argument that anarchy would be
unable to stop thugs seizing power. It ignores the fact that we live in
a society where the power-hungry already rule. As an argument against
anarchism it fails and is, in fact, an argument against hierarchical
societies.

Moreover, it also ignores fact that people in an anarchist society would
have gained their freedom by overthrowing every existing and would-be
thug who had, or desired, power over others. They would have defended
that freedom against those who desired to re-impose it. They would have
organised themselves to manage their own affairs and, therefore, to
abolish all hierarchical power. And we are to believe that these people,
after struggling to become free, would quietly let a new set of thugs
impose themselves? As Kropotkin argued:

> *"The only way in which a state of Anarchy can be obtained is for each
> man [or woman] who is oppressed to act as if he [or she] were at
> liberty, in defiance of all authority to the contrary . . . In
> practical fact, territorial extension is necessary to ensure
> permanency to any given individual revolution. In speaking of the
> Revolution, we signify the aggregate of so many successful individual
> and group revolts as will enable every person within the
> revolutionised territory to act in perfect freedom . . . without
> having to constantly dread the prevention or the vengeance of an
> opposing power upholding the former system . . . Under these
> circumstance it is obvious that any visible reprisal could and would
> be met by a resumption of the same revolutionary action on the part of

> habituated to enjoy freedom from their infancy, they are hardly to
> rest passive in view of what they feel to be wrong."* [Kropotkin,
> **Act for Yourselves**, pp. 87-8]

Thus a free society would use direct action to resist the would-be ruler
just as it had used direct action to free itself from existing rulers.
It would be organised in a way which would facilitate this direct action
as it would be based on networks of solidarity and mutual aid. An injury
to one is an injury to all and a would-be ruler would face a whole
liberated society acting against him or her. Faced with the direct
action of the population (which would express itself in
non-co-operation, strikes, demonstrations, occupations, insurrections
and so on) a would-be power seeker would find it difficult to impose
themselves. Unlike those accustomed to rulership in existing society, an
anarchist people would be a society of rebels and so difficult to
dominate and conquer: *"In the future society, Anarchy will be defence,
the prevention of the re-establishment of any authority, any power, any
State."* [Carlo Cafiero, *"Anarchy and Communism"*, pp. 179-86, **The
Raven**, No. 6, p. 180]

Anarchists point to the example of the rise of Fascism in Italy, Spain
and Germany. In areas with strong anarchist movements the fascists were
resisted most strongly. While in Germany Hitler was met with little or
no opposition, in Italy and Spain the fascists had to fight long and
hard to gain power. The anarchist and anarcho-syndicalist organisations
fought the fascists tooth and nail, with some success before betrayal by
the Republicans and Marxists. From this historical experience anarchists
argue that an anarchist society would quickly and easily defeat would-be
thugs as people would be used to practising direct action and
self-management and would have no desire to stop. A free people would
quickly organise itself in self-managed militias for self-defence (just
as they would during a social revolution to defend it -- [section
J.7.6](secJ7.html#secj76)).

As for self-management resulting in "charismatic" leaders, well the
logic is astounding. As if hierarchical structures are **not** based on
leadership structures and do not require a charismatic leader! Such an
argument is inherently self-contradictory -- as well as ignoring the
nature of modern society and its leadership structures. Rather than mass
assemblies being dominated by leaders, it is the case that hierarchical
structures are the natural breeding ground for dictators. All the great
dictators the world have seen have come to the forefront in
**hierarchical** organisations, **not** libertarian structured ones.
Hitler, for example, did not come to power via self-management. Rather
he used a highly centralised and hierarchically organised party to take
control of a centralised, hierarchical state. The very disempowerment of
the population in capitalist society results in them looking to leaders
to act for them and so *"charismatic"* leaders are a natural result. An
anarchist society, by empowering all, would make it more difficult, not
less, for a would-be leader to gain power -- few people, if any, would
be willing to sacrifice and negate themselves for the benefit of
another.

Our discussion on the power hungry obviously relates to the more general
the question of whether ethical behaviour be rewarded in an anarchist
society. In other words, could an anarchist society be stable or would
the unethical take over?

It is one of the most disturbing aspects of living in a world where the
rush to acquire wealth is the single most important aspect of living is
what happens to people who follow an ethical path in life. Under
capitalism, the ethical generally do not succeed as well as those who
stab their fellows in the back, those who cut corners, indulge in sharp
business practises, drive competitors into the ground and live their
lives with an eye on the bottom line but they do survive. Loyalty to a
firm or a group, bending over backwards to provide a service, giving a
helping hand to somebody in need, placing friendship above money, count
for nothing when the bills come in. People who act ethically in a
capitalist society are usually punished and penalised for their ethical
and principled behaviour. Indeed, the capitalist market rewards
unethical behaviour as it generally reduces costs and so gives those who
do it a competitive edge.

It is different in a free society. Anarchism is based on equal access to
power and wealth. Everybody in an anarchist society irrespective of what
they do, or who they are or what type of work they perform is entitled
to share in society's wealth. Whether a community survives or prospers
depends on the combined efforts of the people in that community. Ethical
behaviour would become the norm in an anarchist community; those people
who act ethically would be rewarded by the standing they achieve in the
community and by others being more than happy to work with and aid them.
People who cut corners, try to exercise power over others, refuse to
co-operate as equals or otherwise act in an unethical manner would lose
their standing. Their neighbours and work mates would refuse to
co-operate with them (or reduce co-operation to a minimum) and take
other forms of non-violent direct action to point out that certain forms
of activity was inappropriate. They would discuss the issue with the
unethical person and try to convince them of the errors of their way. In
a society where the necessities are guaranteed, people would tend to act
ethically because ethical behaviour raises an individuals profile and
standing within such a community. Capitalism and ethical behaviour are
mutually exclusive concepts; anarchism encourages and rewards ethical
behaviour. Needless to say, as we discussed in [section
I.5.8](secI5.html#seci58), anarchists are aware that a free society
would need to defend itself against whatever anti-social behaviour
remains in a free and equal society and seeking to impose your will on
others defines unethical and anti-social!

Therefore, as can be seen, anarchists argue that a free society would
not have to fear would-be thugs, "charismatic" leaders or the unethical.
An anarchist society would be based on the co-operation of free
individuals. It is unlikely that they would tolerate bad behaviour and
would use their own direct action as well as social and economic
organisations to combat it. Moreover, the nature of free co-operation
would reward ethical behaviour as those who practice it would have it
reciprocated by their fellows. and, if worse came to worse, they would
defend their liberty!

One last point. Some people seem to think that anarchism is about the
powerful being appealed to **not** to oppress and dominate others. Far
from it. Anarchism is about the oppressed and exploited refusing to let
others dominate them. It is **not** an appeal to the "better side" of
the boss or would-be boss; it is about the solidarity and direct action
of those subject to a boss **getting rid of the boss** -- whether the
boss agrees to it or not! Once this is clearly understood the idea that
an anarchist society is vulnerable to the power-hungry is clearly
nonsense -- anarchy is based on resisting power and so is, by its very
nature, more resistant to would-be rulers than a hierarchical one.

So, to summarise, anarchists are well aware that an anarchist society
will have to defend itself from both inside and outside attempts to
re-impose capitalism and the state. Indeed, every revolutionary
anarchist has argued that a revolution will have to defend itself (as
proven in [section H.2.1](secH2.html#sech21), Marxist assertions
otherwise have always been myths). This applies to both internal and
external attempts to re-introduce authority.

I.5.12 Would an anarchist society provide health care and other public services?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It depends on the type of anarchist society you are talking about.
Different anarchists propose different solutions.

In an individualist-mutualist society, for example, health care and
other public services would be provided by individuals or co-operatives
on a pay-for-use basis. It would be likely that individuals or
co-operatives/associations would subscribe to various insurance
providers or enter into direct contracts with health care providers.
Thus the system would be similar to privatised health care but without
the profit margins as competition, it is hoped, would drive prices down
to cost.

Other anarchists reject such a system. They are favour of socialising
health care and other public services. They argue that a privatised
system would only be able to meet the requirements of those who can
afford to pay for it and so would be unjust and unfair. In addition,
such systems would have higher overheads (the need to pay share-holders
and the high wages of upper management, most obviously, and not to
mention paying for propaganda against "socialised" medicine) as well as
charge more (privatised public utilities under capitalism have tended to
charge consumers more, unsurprisingly as by their very nature they are
natural monopolies).

Looking at health care, for example, the need for medical attention is
not dependent on income and so a civilised society would recognise this
fact. Under capitalism, profit-maximising medical insurance sets
premiums according to the risks of the insured getting ill or injured,
with the riskiest and most ill not being able to find insurance at any
price. Private insurers shun entire industries as too dangerous for
their profits due to the likelihood of accidents or illness. They review
contracts regularly and drop sick people for the slightest reason
(understandably, given that they make profits by minimising pay-outs for
treatment). Hardly a vision to inspire a free society or one compatible
with equality and mutual respect.

Therefore, most anarchists are in favour of a socialised and universal
health-care system for both ethical and efficiency reasons (see [section
I.4.10](secI4.html#seci410)). Needless to say, an anarchist system of
socialised health care would differ in many ways to the current systems
of universal health-care provided by the state (which, while called
socialised medicine by its enemies is better described as nationalised
medicine -- although it should be stressed that this is better than the
privatised system). Such a system of socialised health-care will be
built from the bottom-up and based around the local commune. In a social
anarchist society, *"medical services . . . will be free of charge to
all inhabitants of the commune. The doctors will not be like
capitalists, trying to extract the greatest profit from their
unfortunate patients. They will be employed by the commune and expected
to treat all who need their services."* Moreover, prevention will play
an important part, as *"medical treatment is only the **curative** side
of the science of health care; it is not enough to treat the sick, it is
also necessary to prevent disease. That is the true function of
hygiene."* [James Guillaume, *"On Building the New Social Order"*, pp.
356-79, **Bakunin on Anarchism**, p. 371] The same would go for other
public services and works.

While rejecting privatisation, anarchists also reject nationalisation in
favour of socialisation and worker's self-management. In this we follow
Proudhon, who argued that there was a series of industries and services
which were *"public works"* which he thought best handled by communes
and their federations. Thus *"the control undertaking such works will
belong to the municipalities, and to districts within their
jurisdiction"* while *"the control of carrying them out will rest with
the workmen's associations."* This was due to both their nature and
libertarian values as the *"direct, sovereign initiative of localities,
in arranging for public works that belong to them, is a consequence of
the democratic principle and the free contract: their subordination to
the State is . . . a return to feudalism."* Workers' self-management of
such public workers is, again, a matter of libertarian principles for
*"it becomes necessary for the workers to form themselves into
democratic societies, with equal conditions for all members, on pain of
a relapse into feudalism."* Railways should be given *"to responsible
companies, not of capitalists, but of WORKMEN."* [**General Idea of the
Revolution**, p. 276, p. 277 and p. 151]

This was applied during the Spanish Revolution. Gaston Leval discussed
*"Achievements in the Public Sector"* in his classic account of the
collectives. Syndicates organised water, gas and electricity utilities
in Catalonia, while the trams and railways were run more efficiently and
cheaper than under capitalist management. All across Spain, the workers
in the health service re-organised their industry on libertarian lines
and in association with the collectives, communes and the unions of the
CNT. As Leval summarised:

> *"For the socialisation of medicine was not just an initiative of
> militant libertarian doctors. Wherever we were able to make s study of
> villages and small towns transformed by the Revolution, medicine and
> existing hospitals had been municipalised, expanded, placed under the
> aegis of the Collective. When there were none, they were improvised.
> The socialisation of medicine was becoming everyone's concern, for the
> benefit of all. It constituted one of the most remarkable achievements
> of the Spanish Revolution."* [**Collectives in the Spanish
> Revolution**, p. 278]

So the Spanish Revolution indicates how an anarchist health service
would operate. In rural areas local doctors would usually join the
village collective and provided their services like any other worker.
Where local doctors were not available, *"arrangements were made by the
collectives for treatment of their members by hospitals in nearby
localities. In a few cases, collectives themselves build hospitals; in
many they acquired equipment and other things needed by their local
physicians."* For example, the Monzon comercal (district) federation of
collectives in Aragon established maintained a hospital in Binefar, the
**Casa de Salud Durruti**. By April 1937 it had 40 beds, in sections
which included general medicine, prophylaxis and gynaecology. It saw
about 25 outpatients a day and was open to anyone in the 32 villages of
the comarca. [Robert Alexander, **The Anarchists in the Spanish Civil
War**, vol. 1, p. 331 and pp. 366-7]

In the Levante, the CNT built upon its existing **Sociedad de Socorros
Mutuos de Levante** (a health service institution founded by the union
as a kind of mutual benefit society which had numerous doctors and
specialists). During the revolution, the Mutua had 50 doctors and was
available to all affiliated workers and their families. The
socialisation of the health care took on a slightly different form in
Catalonia but on the same libertarian principles. Gaston Leval provided
us with an excellent summary:

> *"The socialisation of health services was one of the greatest
> achievements of the revolution. To appreciate the efforts of our
> comrades it must be borne in mind that they rehabilitated the health
> service in all of Catalonia in so short a time after July 19th. The
> revolution could count on the co-operation of a number of dedicated
> doctors whose ambition was not to accumulate wealth but to serve the
> afflicted and the underprivileged.*

> *"The Health Workers' Union was founded in September, 1936. In line
> with the tendency to unite all the different classifications, trades,
> and services serving a given industry, **all** health workers, from
> porters to doctors and administrators, were organised into one big
> union of health workers . . .*

> *"Our comrades laid the foundations of a new health service . . . The
> new medical service embraced all of Catalonia. It constituted a great
> apparatus whose parts were distributed according to different needs,
> all in accord with an overall plan. Catalonia was divided into nine
> zones . . . In turn, all the surrounding villages and towns were
> served from these centres.*

> *"Distributed throughout Catalonia were twenty-seven towns with a
> total of thirty-six health centres conducting services so thoroughly
> that every village, every hamlet, every isolated peasant in the
> mountains, every woman, every child, anywhere, received adequate,
> up-to-date medical care. In each of the nine zones there was a central
> syndicate and a Control Committee located in Barcelona. Every
> department was autonomous within its own sphere. But this autonomy was
> not synonymous with isolation. The Central Committee in Barcelona,
> chosen by all the sections, met once a week with one delegate from
> each section to deal with common problems and to implement the general
> plan . . .*

> *"The people immediately benefited from the projects of the health
> syndicate. The syndicate managed all hospitals and clinics. Six
> hospitals were opened in Barcelona . . . Eight new sanatoriums were
> installed in converted luxurious homes ideally situated amidst
> mountains and pine forests. It was no easy task to convert these homes
> into efficient hospitals with all new facilities."* [**The Anarchist
> Collectives**, Sam Dolgoff (ed.), pp. 99-100]

People were no longer required to pay for medical services. Each
collective, if it could afford it, would pay a contribution to its
health centre. Building and facilities were improved and modern
equipment introduced. Like other self-managed industries, the health
service was run at all levels by general assemblies of workers who
elected delegates and hospital administration.

We can expect a similar process to occur in the future anarchist
society. It would be based on self-management, of course, with close
links to the local commune and federations of communes. Each hospital or
health centre would be autonomous but linked in a federation with the
others, allowing resources to be shared as and when required while
allowing the health service to adjust to local needs and requirements as
quickly as possible. Workers in the health industry will organise their
workplaces, federate together to share resources and information, to
formulate plans and improve the quality of service to the public in a
system of generalised self-management and socialisation. The communes
and their federations, the syndicates and federations of syndicates will
provide resources and effectively own the health system, ensuring access
for all.

Similar systems would operate in other public services. For example, in
education we expect the members of communes to organise a system of free
schools. This can be seen from the Spanish revolution. Indeed, the
Spanish anarchists organised Modern Schools before the outbreak of the
revolution, with 50 to 100 schools in various parts funded by local
anarchist groups and CNT unions. During the revolution everywhere across
Spain, syndicates, collectives and federations of collectives formed and
founded schools. Indeed, education *"advanced at an unprecedented pace.
Most of the partly or wholly socialised collectives and municipalities
built at least one school. By 1938, for example, every collective in the
Levant Federation had its own school."* [Gaston Leval, quoted by Sam
Dolgoff, **Op. Cit.**, p. 168] These schools aimed, to quote the CNT's
resolution on Libertarian Communism, to *"help mould men with minds of
their own -- and let it be clear that when we use the word 'men' we use
it in the generic sense -- to which end it will be necessary for the
teacher to cultivate every one of the child's faculties so that the
child may develop every one of its capacities to the full."* [quoted by
Jose Periats, **The CNT in the Spanish Revolution**, p. 70] The
principles of libertarian education, of encouraging freedom instead of
authority in the school, was applied on vast scale (see [section
J.5.13](secJ5.html#secj513) for more details on Modern Schools and
libertarian education).

This educational revolution was not confined to collectives or children.
For example, the **Federacion Regional de Campesinos de Levante** formed
institutes in each of its five provinces. The first was set up in
October 1937 in an old convent with 100 students. The Federation also
set up two universities in Valencia and Madrid which taught a wide
variety of agricultural subjects and combined learning with practical
experience in an experimental form attached to each university. The
Aragon collectives formed a similar specialised school in Binefar. The
CNT was heavily involved in transforming education in Catalonia. In
addition, the local federation of the CNT in Barcelona established a
school to train women workers to replace male ones being taken into the
army. The school was run by the anarcha-feminist group the **Mujeres
Libres**. [Robert Alexander, **Op. Cit.**, p. 406, p. 670 and pp. 665-8
and p. 670]

Ultimately, the public services that exist in a social anarchist society
will be dependent on what members of that society desire. If, for
example, a commune or federation of communes desires a system of
communal health-care or schools then they will allocate resources to
implement it. They will allocate the task of creating such a system to,
say, a special commission based on volunteers from the interested
parties such as the relevant syndicates, professional associations,
consumer groups and so on. For example, for communal education a
commission or working group would include delegates from the teachers
union, from parent associations, from student unions and so on. The
running of such a system would be, like any other industry, by those who
work in it. Functional self-management would be the rule, with doctors
managing their work, nurses theirs and so on, while the general running
of, say, a hospital would be based on a general assembly of all workers
there who would elect and mandate the administration staff and decide
the policy the hospital would follow. Other interested parties would
have a say, including patients in the health system and students in the
education system. As Malatesta argued *"the carrying out and the normal
functioning of public services vital to our daily lives would be more
reliable if carried out . . . by the workers themselves who, by direct
election or through agreements made with others, have chosen to do that
kind of work and carry it out under the direct control of all the
interested parties."* [**Anarchy**, p. 41]

Needless to say, any system of public services would not be imposed on
those who did not desire it. They would be organised for and by members
of the communes and so individuals who were not part of one would have
to pay to gain access to communal resources. However, it is unlikely
that an anarchist society would be as barbaric as a capitalist one and
refuse entry to people who were ill and could not pay, nor turn away
emergencies because they did not have enough money. And just as other
workers need not join a syndicate or commune, so doctors, teachers and
so on could practice their trade outside the communal system as either
individual artisans or as part of a co-operative. However, given the
availability of free medical services it is doubtful they would grow
rich doing so. Medicine, teaching and so on would revert back to what
usually motivates people to initially take these up professions -- the
desire to help others and make a positive impact in society.

Thus, as would be expected, public services would be organised by the
public, organised in their syndicates and communes. They would be based
on workers' self-management of their daily work and of the system as a
whole. Non-workers who took part in the system (patients, students,
etc.) would not be ignored and would also play a role in providing
essential feedback to assure quality control of services and to ensure
that it is responsive to users needs. The resources required to maintain
and expand the system would be provided by the communes, syndicates and
their federations. For the first time, public services would truly be
public and not a statist system imposed upon the public from above nor a
system by which the few fleece the many by exploiting natural monopolies
for their own interests.

So Public Services in a free society will be organised by those who do
the work and under the effective control of those who use them. This
vision of public services being run by workers' associations would be
raised as a valid libertarian reform under capitalism (not to mention
raising the demand to turn firms into co-operatives when they are bailed
out during an economic crisis). Equally, rather than nationalisation or
privatisation, public utilities could be organised as a consumer
co-operative (i.e., owned by those who use it) while the day-to-day
running could be in the hands of a producer co-operative.
