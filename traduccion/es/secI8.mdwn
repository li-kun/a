I.8 Does revolutionary Spain show that libertarian socialism can work in practice?
==================================================================================

Yes. Revolutionary Spain *"shows you what human beings are like when
they are trying to behave as human beings and not as cogs in the
capitalist machine."* [George Orwell, **Orwell in Spain**, p. 254] At
the heart of the transformation were the CNT (the National Confederation
of Labour, an anarcho-syndicalist union) and the FAI (Iberian Anarchist
Federation). As Murray Bookchin put it:

> *"In Spain, millions of people took large segments of the economy into
> their own hands, collectivised them, administered them, even abolished
> money and lived by communistic principles of work and distribution --
> all of this in the midst of a terrible civil war, yet without
> producing the chaos or even the serious dislocations that were and
> still are predicted by authoritarian 'radicals.' Indeed, in many
> collectivised areas, the efficiency with which an enterprise worked by
> far exceeded that of a comparable one in nationalised or private
> sectors. This 'green shoot' of revolutionary reality has more meaning
> for us than the most persuasive theoretical arguments to the contrary.
> On this score it is not the anarchists who are the 'unrealistic
> day-dreamers,' but their opponents who have turned their backs to the
> facts or have shamelessly concealed them."* [*"Introductory Essay,"*
> **The Anarchist Collectives**, Sam Dolgoff (ed.), p. xxxix]

Anarchist and CNT activist Gaston Leval comments that in those areas
which defeated the fascist uprising on the 19th of July 1936 a profound
social revolution took place based, mostly, on anarchist ideas:

> *"In Spain, during almost three years, despite a civil war that took a
> million lives, despite the opposition of the political parties . . .
> this idea of libertarian communism was put into effect. Very quickly
> more than 60% of the land was collectively cultivated by the peasants
> themselves, without landlords, without bosses, and without instituting
> capitalist competition to spur production. In almost all the
> industries, factories, mills, workshops, transportation services,
> public services, and utilities, the rank and file workers, their
> revolutionary committees, and their syndicates reorganised and
> administered production, distribution, and public services without
> capitalists, high-salaried managers, or the authority of the state.*

> *"Even more: the various agrarian and industrial collectives
> immediately instituted economic equality in accordance with the
> essential principle of communism, 'From each according to his ability
> and to each according to his needs.' They co-ordinated their efforts
> through free association in whole regions, created new wealth,
> increased production (especially in agriculture), built more schools,
> and bettered public services. They instituted not bourgeois formal
> democracy but genuine grass roots functional libertarian democracy,
> where each individual participated directly in the revolutionary
> reorganisation of social life. They replaced the war between men,
> 'survival of the fittest,' by the universal practice of mutual aid,
> and replaced rivalry by the principle of solidarity . . .*

> *"This experience, in which about eight million people directly or
> indirectly participated, opened a new way of life to those who sought
> an alternative to anti-social capitalism on the one hand, and
> totalitarian state bogus socialism on the other."* [**Op. Cit.**, pp.
> 6-7]

Thus about eight million people directly or indirectly participated in
the libertarian based new economy during the short time it was able to
survive the military assaults of the fascists and the attacks and
sabotage of the Communists and Republican state. This in itself suggests
that libertarian socialist ideas are of a practical nature.

Lest the reader think that Leval and Bookchin are exaggerating the
accomplishments and ignoring the failures of the Spanish collectives, in
the following subsections we will present specific details and answer
some objections often raised by misinformed critics. We will try to
present an objective analysis of the revolution, its many successes, its
strong and weak points, the mistakes made and possible lessons to be
drawn from the experience, both from the successes and the failures.
However, this will hardly do justice to the collectivisation as it
*"assumed an infinite diversity of forms from village to village, and
even in the different firms collectivised in the cities . . . there was
an element of improvisation and of the exceptional wartime conditions
experienced by the country (i.e., the war against fascism) and the
arrangements had their flaws as well as their good points."* [Jose
Peirats, **The CNT in the Spanish Revolution**, vol. 1, p. 223]

This libertarian influenced revolution has (generally) been ignored by
historians, or its existence mentioned in passing. Some so-called
historians and "objective investigators" have slandered it and lied
about (when not ignoring) the role anarchists played in it. Communist
histories are particularly unreliable (to use a polite word for their
activities) but it seems that almost **every** political perspective has
done this (including liberal, so-called right-wing "libertarian",
Stalinist, Trotskyist, Marxist, and so on). So any attempt to
investigate what actually occurred in Spain and the anarchists' role in
it is subject to a great deal of difficulty. Moreover, the positive role
that Anarchists played in the revolution and the positive results of our
ideas when applied in practice are also downplayed, if not ignored.
Indeed, the misrepresentations of the Spanish Anarchist movement are
downright amazing (see Jerome R. Mintz's wonderful book **The Anarchists
of Casa Viejas** and J. Romero Maura's article *"The Spanish case"*
[**Anarchism Today**, J. Joll and D. Apter (eds.)] for a refutation of
many of the standard assertions and distortions about the Spanish
anarchist movement by historians). The myths generated by Marxists of
various shades are, perhaps needless to say, the most extensive (see the
appendix on [*"Marxists and Spanish Anarchism"*](append32.html) for a
reply to some of the more common ones).

All we can do here is present a summary of the social revolution that
took place and attempt to explode a few of the myths that have been
created around the work of the CNT and FAI during those years. We must
stress that this can be nothing but a short introduction to the Spanish
Revolution. We concentrate on the economic and political aspects of the
revolution as we cannot cover everything. However, we must mention the
social transformations that occurred all across non-fascist Spain. The
revolution saw the traditional social relationships between men and
women, adults and children, individual and individual transformed,
revolutionised in a libertarian way. CNT militant Abel Paz gave a good
idea of what happened:

> *"Industry is in the hands of the workers and all the production
> centres conspicuously fly the red and black flags as well as
> inscriptions announcing that they have really become collectives. The
> revolution seems to be universal. Changes are also evident in social
> relations. The former barriers which used to separate men and woman
> arbitrarily have been destroyed. In the cafes and other public places
> there is a mingling of the sexes which would have been completely
> unimaginable before. The revolution has introduced a fraternal
> character to social relations which has deepened with practice and
> show clearly that the old world is dead."* [**Durruti: The People
> Armed**, p. 243]

The social transformation empowered individuals and these, in turn,
transformed society. Anarchist militant Enriqueta Rovira presents a
vivid picture of the self-liberation the revolution generated:

> *"The atmosphere then, the feelings were very special. It was
> beautiful. A feeling of -- how shall I say it -- of power, not in the
> sense of domination, but in the sense of things being under **our**
> control, of under anyone's. Of **possibility**. We **had** everything.
> We had Barcelona: It was ours. You'd walk out in the streets, and they
> were ours -- here, CNT; there, **comite** this or that. It was totally
> different. Full of possibility. A feeling that we could, together,
> really **do** something. That we could make things different."*
> [quoted by Martha A. Ackelsberg and Myrna Margulies Breithart,
> *"Terrains of Protest: Striking City Women"*, pp. 151-176, **Our
> Generation**, vol. 19, No. 1, pp. 164-5]

Moreover, the transformation of society that occurred during the
revolution extended to all areas of life and work. For example, the
revolution saw *"the creation of a health workers' union, a true
experiment in socialised medicine. They provided medical assistance and
opened hospitals and clinics."* [Juan Gomez Casas, **Anarchist
Organisation: The History of the FAI**, p. 192] We discuss this example
in some detail in [section I.5.12](secI5.html#seci512) and so will not
do so here. We simply stress that this section of the FAQ is just an
introduction to what happened and does not (indeed, cannot) discuss all
aspects of the revolution. We just present an overview, bringing out the
libertarian aspects of the revolution, the ways workers' self-management
was organised, how the collectives organised and what they did.

Needless to say, many mistakes were made during the revolution. We point
out and discuss some of them in what follows. Moreover, much of what
happened did not correspond exactly with what many people consider as
the essential steps in a communist (libertarian or otherwise)
revolution. Nor, it must be stressed, did much of it reflect the
pre-revolution stated aims of the CNT itself. Economically, for example,
the collectives themselves were an unexpected development, one which was
based on libertarian principles but also reflected the reality of the
situation the CNT militants found themselves in. Much the same can be
said of the fact that few collectives reached beyond mutualism or
collectivism in spite of the CNT seeking a libertarian communist
economy. Politically, the fear of a fascist victory made many anarchists
accept collaboration with the state as a lesser evil. However, to
dismiss the Spanish Revolution because it did not meet the ideals laid
out by a handful of revolutionaries beforehand would be sectarian and
elitist nonsense. No working class revolution is pure, no mass struggle
is without its contradictions, no attempt to change society is perfect.
*"It is only those who do nothing who make no mistakes,"* as Kropotkin
so correctly pointed out. [**Anarchism**, p. 143] The question is
whether the revolution creates a system of institutions which will allow
those involved to discuss the problems they face, change the decisions
reached and correct any mistakes they make. In this, the Spanish
Revolution clearly succeeded, creating organisations based on the
initiative, autonomy and power of working class people.

For more information about the social revolution, Sam Dolgoff's
anthology **The Anarchist Collectives** is an excellent starting place.
Gaston Leval's **Collectives in the Spanish Revolution** is another
essential text. Jose Peirats' **Anarchists in the Spanish Revolution**
and his three volume quasi-official history **The CNT in the Spanish
Revolution** are key works. Vernon Richards' **Lessons of the Spanish
Revolution** is an excellent critical anarchist work on the revolution
and the role of the anarchists. **Spain 1936-1939: Social Revolution and
Counter-Revolution** (edited by Vernon Richards) is a useful collection
of articles from the time. Abel Paz's **Durruti in the Spanish
Revolution** is a classic biography of Spanish anarchism's most famous
militant (this is an expanded version of his earlier **Durruti: The
People Armed**). Emma Goldman's opinions on the Spanish Revolution are
collected in **Vision on Fire**.

Robert Alexander's **The Anarchists in the Spanish Civil War** is a good
general overview of the anarchist's role in the revolution and civil
war, as is Burnett Bolloten's **The Spanish Civil War**. Daniel Guérin's
anthology **No Gods, No Masters** as two sections on the Spanish
Revolution, one specifically on the collectives. Noam Chomsky's
excellent essay *"Objectivity and Liberal Scholarship"* indicates how
liberal books on the Spanish Civil War can be misleading, unfair and
essentially ideological in nature (this classic essay can be found in
**Chomsky on Anarchism**, **The Chomsky Reader**, and **American Power
and the New Mandarins**). George Orwell's **Homage to Catalonia** cannot
be bettered as an introduction to the subject (Orwell was in the POUM
militia at the Aragón Front and was in Barcelona during the May Days of
1937). This classic account is contained along with other works by
Orwell about the conflict in the anthology **Orwell in Spain**. Murray
Bookchin's **The Spanish Anarchists** is a useful history, but ends just
as the revolution breaks out and so needs to be completed by his **To
Remember Spain** and the essay *"Looking Back at Spain"*. Stuart
Christie's **We, The Anarchists!** is an important history on the
Iberian Anarchist Federation.

I.8.1 Is the Spanish Revolution inapplicable as a model for modern societies?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Quite the reverse. More urban workers took part in the revolution than
in the countryside. So while it is true that collectivisation was
extensive in rural areas, the revolution also made its mark in urban
areas and in industry.

In total, the *"regions most affected"* by collectivisation *"were
Catalonia and Aragón, where about 70 per cent of the workforce was
involved. The total for the whole of Republican territory was nearly
800,000 on the land and a little more than a million in industry. In
Barcelona workers' committees took over all the services, the oil
monopoly, the shipping companies, heavy engineering firms such as
Volcano, the Ford motor company, chemical companies, the textile
industry and a host of smaller enterprises . . . Services such as water,
gas and electricity were working under new management within hours of
the storming of the Atarazanas barracks . . . a conversion of
appropriate factories to war production meant that metallurgical
concerns had started to produce armed cars by 22 July . . . The
industrial workers of Catalonia were the most skilled in Spain . . . One
of the most impressive feats of those early days was the resurrection of
the public transport system at a time when the streets were still
littered and barricaded."* Five days after the fighting had stopped, 700
tramcars rather than the usual 600, all painted in the black-and-red
colours of the CNT-FAI, were operating in Barcelona. [Antony Beevor,
**The Spanish Civil War**, pp. 91-2]

About 75% of Spanish industry was concentrated in Catalonia, the
stronghold of the anarchist labour movement, and widespread
collectivisation of factories took place there. As Sam Dolgoff rightly
observed, this *"refutes decisively the allegation that anarchist
organisational principles are not applicable to industrial areas, and if
at all, only in primitive agrarian societies or in isolated experimental
communities."* [**The Anarchist Collectives**, pp. 7-8] According to
Augustin Souchy:

> *"It is no simple matter to collectivise and place on firm foundations
> an industry employing almost a quarter of a million textile workers in
> scores of factories scattered in numerous cities. But the Barcelona
> syndicalist textile union accomplished this feat in a short time. It
> was a tremendously significant experiment. The dictatorship of the
> bosses was toppled, and wages, working conditions and production were
> determined by the workers and their elected delegates. All
> functionaries had to carry out the instructions of the membership and
> report back directly to the men on the job and union meetings. The
> collectivisation of the textile industry shatters once and for all the
> legend that the workers are incapable of administrating a great and
> complex corporation."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 94]

Moreover, Spain in the 1930s was **not** a backward, peasant country, as
is sometimes supposed. Between 1910 and 1930, the industrial working
class more than doubled to over 2,500,000. This represented just over
26% of the working population (compared to 16% twenty years previously).
In 1930, only 45% of the working population were engaged in agriculture.
[Ronald Fraser, **The Blood of Spain**, p. 38] In Catalonia alone,
200,000 workers were employed in the textile industry and 70,000 in
metal-working and machinery manufacturing. This was very different than
the situation in Russia at the end of World War I, where the urban
working class made up only 10% of the population.

Capitalist social relations had also penetrated the rural economy by the
1930s with agriculture oriented to the world market and approximately
90% of farm land in the hands of the bourgeoisie. [Fraser, **Op. Cit.**,
p. 37] So by 1936 agriculture was predominately capitalist, with Spanish
agribusiness employing large numbers of labourers who either did not own
enough land to support themselves or where landless. The labour movement
in the Spanish countryside in the 1930s was precisely based on this
large population of rural wage-earners (the socialist UGT land workers
union had 451,000 members in 1933, 40% of its total membership, for
example). In Russia at the time of the revolution of 1917, agriculture
mostly consisted of small farms on which peasant families worked mainly
for their own subsistence, bartering or selling their surplus.

Therefore the Spanish Revolution cannot be dismissed as a product a of
pre-industrial society. The urban collectivisations occurred
predominately in the most heavily industrialised part of Spain and
indicate that anarchist ideas are applicable to modern societies Indeed,
comforting Marxist myths aside, the CNT organised most of the unionised
urban working class and, internally, agricultural workers were a
minority of its membership (by 1936, the CNT was making inroads in
Madrid, previously a socialist stronghold while the UGT main area of
growth in the 1930s was with, ironically, rural workers). The revolution
in Spain was the work (mostly) of rural and urban wage labourers (joined
with poor peasants) fighting a well developed capitalist system.

In summary, then, the anarchist revolution in Spain has many lessons for
revolutionaries in developed capitalist countries and cannot be
dismissed as a product of industrial backwardness. The main strength lay
of the anarchist movement was in urban areas and, unsurprisingly, the
social revolution took place in both the most heavily industrialised
areas as well as on the land.

I.8.2 How were the anarchists able to obtain mass popular support in Spain?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Revolutionary anarchism was introduced in Spain in 1868 by Giuseppi
Fanelli, an associate of Michael Bakunin, and found fertile soil among
both the workers and the peasants. Those historians who gleefully note
that Bakunin sent someone who did not speak Spanish to spread his
message in Spain forget how close the Latin languages are to each other.
Fanelli was more than able to be understood by his Spanish and Catalan
speaking hosts who, it should be noted, were already familiar with
Proudhon's ideas.

The key reason why Bakunin's ideas gained such ready support in Spain
was that they reflected ideas that they had already developed
themselves. The peasants supported anarchism because of the rural
tradition of Iberian collectivism which had existed for generations. The
urban workers supported it because its ideas of direct action,
solidarity and free federation of unions corresponded to their needs in
their struggle against capitalism and the state. Neither needed to be
told that capitalism was oppressive and exploitative or that the state
existed to defend this class system. In addition, many Spanish workers
were well aware of the dangers of centralisation and the republican
tradition in Spain was very much influenced by federalist ideas (coming,
in part, from Proudhon's work as popularised by Pi y Margall, soon to
become the President of the first Republic). The movement spread back
and forth between countryside and cities as urban based union organisers
and anarchist militants visited villages and peasants and landless
agricultural workers came to industrial cities, like Barcelona, looking
for work.

Therefore, from the start anarchism in Spain was associated with the
labour movement (as Bakunin desired) and so anarchists had a practical
area to apply their ideas and spread the anarchist message. By applying
their principles in everyday life, the anarchists in Spain ensured that
anarchist ideas became commonplace and accepted in a large section of
the population.

This acceptance of anarchism cannot be separated from the structure and
tactics of the CNT and its fore-runners. The practice of direct action
and solidarity encouraged workers to rely on themselves, to identify and
solve their own problems. The decentralised structure of the anarchist
unions had an educational effect of their members. By discussing issues,
struggles, tactics, ideals and politics in their union assemblies, the
members of the union educated themselves and, by the process of
self-management in the struggle, prepared themselves for a free society.
The very organisational structure of the CNT ensured the dominance of
anarchist ideas and the political evolution of the union membership. As
one CNT militant from Casas Viejas put it, new members *"asked for too
much, because they lacked education. They thought they could reach the
sky without a ladder . . . they were beginning to learn . . . There was
good faith but lack of education. For that reason we would submit ideas
to the assembly, and the bad ideas would be thrown out."* [quoted by
Jerome R. Mintz, **The Anarchists of Casas Viejas**, p. 27]

It was by working in the union meetings that anarchists influenced their
fellow workers. The idea that the anarchists, through the FAI,
controlled the CNT is a myth. Not all anarchists in the CNT were members
of the FAI, for example. Almost all FAI members were also rank-and-file
members of the CNT who took part in union meetings as equals. Anarchists
were not members of the FAI indicate this. Jose Borras Casacarosa
confirmed that *"[o]ne has to recognise that the FAI did not intervene
in the CNT from above or in an authoritarian manner as did other
political parties in the unions. It did so from the base through
militants . . . the decisions which determined the course taken by the
CNT were taken under constant pressure from these militants."* Jose
Campos noted that FAI militants *"tended to reject control of confederal
committees and only accepted them on specific occasions . . . if someone
proposed a motion in assembly, the other FAI members would support it,
usually successfully. It was the individual standing of the **faista**
in open assembly."* [quoted by Stuart Christie, **We, the Anarchists**,
p. 62]

This explains the success of anarchism in the CNT. Anarchist ideas,
principles and tactics, submitted to the union assemblies, proved to be
good ideas and were not thrown out. The structure of the organisation,
in other words, decisively influenced the **content** of the decisions
reached as ideas, tactics, union policy and so on were discussed by the
membership and those which best applied to the members' lives were
accepted and implemented. The CNT assemblies showed the validity of
Bakunin's arguments for self-managed unions as a means of ensuring
workers' control of their own destinies and organisations. As he put it,
the union *"sections could defend their rights and their autonomy
[against union bureaucracy] in only one way: the workers called general
membership meetings . . . In these great meetings of the sections, the
items on the agenda were amply discussed and the most progressive
opinion prevailed."* [**Bakunin on Anarchism**, p. 247] The CNT was
built on such *"popular assemblies,"* with the same radicalising effect.
It showed, in practice, that bosses (capitalist as well as union ones)
were not needed -- workers can manage their own affairs directly. As a
school for anarchism it could not be bettered as it showed that
anarchist principles were not utopian. The CNT, by being based on
workers' self-management of the class struggle, prepared its members for
self-management of the revolution and the new society.

The Spanish Revolution also shows the importance of anarchist education
and media. In a country with a very high illiteracy rate, huge
quantities of literature on social revolution were disseminated and read
out at meetings for those who could not read. Anarchist ideas were
widely discussed: *"There were tens of thousands of books, pamphlets and
tracts, vast and daring cultural and popular educational experiments
(the Ferrer schools) that reached into almost every village and hamlet
throughout Spain."* [Sam Dolgoff, **The Anarchist Collectives**, p. 27]
The discussion of political, economic and social ideas was continuous,
and *"the centro [local union hall] became the gathering place to
discuss social issues and to dream and plan for the future. Those who
aspired to learn to read and write would sit around . . . studying."*
[Mintz, **Op. Cit.**, p. 160] One anarchist militant described it as
follows:

> *"With what joy the orators were received whenever a meeting was held
> . . . We spoke that night about everything: of the ruling inequality
> of the regime and of how one had a right to a life without
> selfishness, hatred, without wars and suffering. We were called on
> another occasion and a crowd gathered larger than the first time.
> That's how the pueblo started to evolve, fighting the present regime
> to win something by which they could sustain themselves, and dreaming
> of the day when it would be possible to create that society some
> depict in books, others by word of mouth. Avid for learning, they read
> everything, debated, discussed, and chatted about the different modes
> of perfect social existence."* [Perez Cordon, quoted by Mintz, **Op.
> Cit.**, p. 158]

Newspapers and periodicals were extremely important. By 1919, more than
50 towns in Andalusia had their own libertarian newspapers. By 1934 the
CNT had a membership of around one million and the anarchist press
covered all of Spain. In Barcelona the CNT published a daily,
**Solidaridad Obrera** (Worker Solidarity), with a circulation of
30,000. The FAI's magazine **Tierra y Libertad** (Land and Liberty) had
a circulation of 20,000. In Gijon there was **Vida Obrera** (Working
Life), in Seville **El Productor** (The Producer) and in Saragossa
**Accion y Cultura** (Action and Culture), each with a large
circulation. There were many more.

As well as leading struggles, organising unions, and producing books,
papers and periodicals, the anarchists also organised libertarian
schools, cultural centres, co-operatives, anarchist groups (the FAI),
youth groups (the Libertarian Youth) and women's organisations (the Free
Women movement). They applied their ideas in all walks of life and so
ensured that ordinary people saw that anarchism was practical and
relevant to them.

This was the great strength of the Spanish Anarchist movement. It was a
movement *"that, in addition to possessing a revolutionary ideology
[sic], was also capable of mobilising action around objectives firmly
rooted in the life and conditions of the working class . . . It was this
ability periodically to identify and express widely felt needs and
feelings that, together with its presence at community level, formed the
basis of the strength of radical anarchism, and enabled it to build a
mass base of support."* [Nick Rider, *"The practice of direct action:
the Barcelona rent strike of 1931"*, pp. 79-105, **For Anarchism**,
David Goodway (Ed.), p. 99]

Historian Temma Kaplan stressed this in her work on the Andalusian
anarchists. She argued that the anarchists were *"rooted in"* social
life and created *"a movement firmly based in working-class culture."*
They *"formed trade unions, affinity groups such as housewives'
sections, and broad cultural associations such as workers' circles,
where the anarchist press was read and discussed."* Their *"great
strength . . . lay in the merger of communal and militant trade union
traditions. In towns where the vast majority worked in agriculture,
agricultural workers' unions came to be identified with the community as
a whole . . . anarchism . . . show[ed] that the demands of agricultural
workers and proletarians could be combined with community support to
create an insurrectionary situation . . . It would be a mistake . . . to
argue that 'village anarchism' in Andalusia was distinct from militant
unionism, or that the movement was a surrogate religion."* [**Anarchists
of Andalusia: 1868-1903**, p. 211, p. 207 and pp. 204-5]

The Spanish anarchists, before and after the CNT was formed, fought in
and out of the factory for economic, social and political issues. This
refusal of the anarchists to ignore any aspect of life ensured that they
found many willing to hear their message, a message based around the
ideas of individual liberty. Such a message could do nothing but
radicalise workers for *"the demands of the CNT went much further than
those of any social democrat: with its emphasis on true equality,
**autogestion** [self-management] and working class dignity,
anarchosyndicalism made demands the capitalist system could not possibly
grant to the workers."* [J. Romero Maura, *"The Spanish case"*, pp.
60-83, **Anarchism Today**, D. Apter and J. Joll (eds.), p. 79]

Strikes, due to the lack of strike funds, depended on mutual aid to be
won, which fostered a strong sense of solidarity and class consciousness
in the CNT membership. Strikes did not just involve workers. For
example, workers in Jerez responded to bosses importing workers from
Malaga *"with a weapon of their own -- a boycott of those using
strike-breakers. The most notable boycotts were against landowners near
Jerez who also had commercial establishments in the city. The workers
and their wives refused to buy there, and the women stationed themselves
nearby to discourage other shoppers."* [Mintz, **Op. Cit.**, p. 102]

The structure and tactics of the CNT encouraged the politicisation,
initiative and organisational skills of its members. It was a federal,
decentralised body, based on direct discussion and decision making from
the bottom up (*"The CNT tradition was to discuss and examine
everything"*, as one militant put it). In addition, the CNT created a
viable and practical example of an alternative method by which society
could be organised. A method which was based on the ability of ordinary
people to direct society themselves and which showed in practice that
special ruling authorities are undesirable and unnecessary. This
produced a revolutionary working class the likes of which the world has
rarely seen. As Jose Peirats pointed out, *"above the union level, the
CNT was an eminently political organisation . . ., a social and
revolutionary organisation for agitation and insurrection."*
[**Anarchists in the Spanish Revolution**, p. 239] The CNT was organised
in such a way as to encourage solidarity and class consciousness. Its
organisation was based on the **sindicato unico** (one union) which
united all workers of the same workplace in the same union. Instead of
organising by trade, and so dividing the workers into numerous different
unions, the CNT united all workers in a workplace into the same
organisation, all trades, skilled and unskilled, were in a single
organisation and so solidarity was increased and encouraged as well as
increasing their fighting power by eliminating divisions within the
workforce. All the unions in an area were linked together into a local
federation, the local federations into a regional federation and so on.
As J. Romero Maura argued, the *"territorial basis of organisation
linkage brought all the workers from one area together and fomented
working-class solidarity over and above corporate [industry or trade]
solidarity."* [**Op. Cit.**p. 75]

Thus the structure of the CNT encouraged class solidarity and
consciousness. In addition, being based on direct action and
self-management, the union ensured that working people became accustomed
to managing their own struggles and acting for themselves, directly.
This prepared them to manage their own personal and collective interests
in a free society (as seen by the success of the self-managed
collectives created in the revolution). Thus the process of self-managed
struggle and direct action prepared people for the necessities of the
social revolution and the an anarchist society -- it built, as Bakunin
argued, the seeds of the future in the present.

In other words, *"the route to radicalisation . . . came from direct
involvement in struggle and in the design of alternative social
institutions."* Every strike and action empowered those involved and
created a viable alternative to the existing system. For example, while
the strikes and food protests in Barcelona at the end of the First World
War *"did not topple the government, patterns of organisation
established then provided models for the anarchist movement for years to
follow."* [Martha A. Ackelsberg and Myrna Margulies Breithart,
*"Terrains of Protest: Striking City Women"*, pp. 151-176, **Our
Generation**, vol. 19, No. 1, p. 164] The same could be said of every
strike, which confirmed Bakunin's and Kropotkin's stress on the strike
as not only creating class consciousness and confidence but also the
structures necessary to not only fight capitalism, but to replace it.

In summary, then, anarchism gained mass support by anarchists
participating in mass struggles and movements, showing that its ideas
and ideals were applicable to working class experiences. In fact, to
even wonder why anarchism gained support in Spain is, to some degree, to
implicitly assume, with Marxists of various shades, that only state
socialism reflects the needs of working class people. Discussing the
question why the social democratic or Communist movements did not
replace anarchism in Spain, historian J. Romero Maura correctly pointed
out that this *"is based on the false assumption that the
anarcho-syndicalist conception of the workers' struggle in
pre-revolutionary society was completely at odds with what the **real**
social process signified (hence the constant reference to 'religious'
'messianic' models as explanations)."* After discussing and refuting
five common suggestions for the success of anarchism in Spain, he
concluded that the *"explanation of Spanish anarcho-syndicalism's
success in organising a mass movement with a sustained revolutionary
**elan** should initially be sought in the very nature of the anarchist
conception of society and of how to achieve revolution."* [**Op. Cit.**
p. 78 and p. 65]

It was the revolutionary nature of the CNT that created a militant
membership who were willing and able to use direct action to defend
their liberty. Unlike the Marxist led German workers, organised in a
centralised fashion and trained in the obedience required by hierarchy,
who did nothing to stop Hitler, the Spanish working class (like their
comrades in anarchist unions in Italy) took to the streets to stop
fascism.

The revolution in Spain did not "just happen"; it was the result of
nearly seventy years of persistent anarchist agitation and revolutionary
struggle, including a long series of strikes, protests, boycotts,
uprisings and other forms of direct action that prepared the peasants
and workers organise popular resistance to the attempted fascist coup in
July 1936 and to take control of society when they had defeated it in
the streets.

I.8.3 How were Spanish industrial collectives organised?
--------------------------------------------------------

Martha A. Ackelsberg gives us an excellent short summary of how the
industrial collectives where organised:

> *"Pre-existing structures of worker organisation made possible a
> workers' take-over of much of the industrial economy, especially in
> Catalonia . . . Factory committees formed to direct production and
> co-ordinate with other units within the same industry. Union
> organisations co-ordinated both the production and distribution of
> manufactured goods across industries and regions . . . In most
> collectivised industries, general assemblies of workers decided
> policy, while elected committees managed affairs on a day-to-day
> basis."* [**Free Women of Spain**, p. 100]

The collectives were based on workers' democratic self-management of
their workplaces, using productive assets that were under the
custodianship of the entire working community and administered through
federations of workers' associations:

> *"The collectives organised during the Spanish Civil War were workers'
> economic associations without private property. The fact that
> collective plants were managed by those who worked in them did not
> mean that these establishments became their private property. The
> collective had no right to sell or rent all or any part of the
> collectivised factory or workshop. The rightful custodian was the CNT,
> the National Confederation of Workers Associations. But not even the
> CNT had the right to do as it pleased. Everything had to be decided
> and ratified by the workers themselves through conferences and
> congresses."* [Augustin Souchy, **The Anarchist Collectives**, p. 67]

In Catalonia *"every factory elected its administrative committee
composed of its most capable workers. Depending on the size of the
factory, the function of these committees included inner plant
organisation, statistics, finance, correspondence, and relations with
other factories and with the community . . . Several months after
collectivisation the textile industry of Barcelona was in far better
shape than under capitalist management. Here was yet another example to
show that grass roots socialism from below does not destroy initiative.
Greed is not the only motivation in human relations."* [Souchy, **Op.
Cit.**, p 95]

Thus the individual collective was based on a mass assembly of those who
worked there. This assembly nominated administrative staff who were
mandated to implement the decisions of the assembly and who had to
report back, and were accountable, to that assembly. For example, in
Castellon de la Plana *"[e]very month the technical and administrative
council presented the general assembly of the Syndicate with a report
which was examined and discussed if necessary, and finally introduced
when this majority thought it of use. Thus all the activities were known
and controlled by all the workers. We find here a practical example of
libertarian democracy."* [Gaston Leval, **Collectives in the Spanish
Revolution**, p. 303] Power rested at the base of the collective, with
*"all important decisions [being] taken by the general assemblies of the
workers"* which *"were widely attended and regularly held . . . if an
administrator did something which the general assembly had not
authorised, he was likely to be deposed at the next meeting."* An
example of this process can be seen from the Casa Rivieria company.
After the defeat of the army coup *"a control committee (Comite de
Control) was named by the Barcelona Metal Workers' Union to take over
temporary control of the enterprises . . . A few weeks after July 19th,
there was the first general assembly of the firm's workers . . . It
elected an enterprise committee (Comite de Empresa) to take control of
the firm on a more permanent basis. . . . Each of the four sections of
the firm -- the three factories and the office staff -- held their own
general assemblies at least once a week. There they discussed matters
ranging from the most important affairs to the most trivial."* [Robert
Alexander, **The Anarchists in the Spanish Civil War**, vol. 1, p. 469
and p. 532]

In summary, the collectives in Spain were marked by workplace
self-management. They successfully implemented the long-standing
libertarian goal of turning industry from an autocracy to a democracy,
of replacing wage-labour with free-labour based on the association of
equals (see [section I.3.1](secI3.html#seci31)). However, it would be a
mistake to assume (as many do, particularly Marxists) that the CNT and
FAI considered the creation of self-managed collectives as the end of
the revolution. Far from it. While they embodied such key libertarian
principles as workers' self-management, they were fundamentally a
product of both anarchist ideas **and** the specific situation in which
they were created. Rather than seek a market system of producer
co-operatives, the CNT was committed to the full socialisation of the
economy and the creation of libertarian communism. The collectives were,
as a result, seen as development towards that goal rather than as an end
in themselves. Moreover, as historian Ronald Fraser notes, it *"was
doubtful that the CNT had seriously envisaged collectivisation of
industry . . . before this time."* [**The Blood of Spain**, p. 212] CNT
policy was opposed to the collectivisation decree of the Catalonian
government, for example, which formalised (and controlled) the
spontaneous gains of the revolution as expressed by the collectives.

Therefore, the collectives were (initially) a form of *"self-management
straddling capitalism and socialism, which we maintain would not have
occurred had the Revolution been able to extend itself fully under the
direction of our syndicates."* In other words, the revolution saw the
abolition of wage-labour but not of the wages system. Thus capitalism
was replaced by mutualism, not the socialism desired by most anarchists
(namely libertarian communism). As economic and political development
are closely related, the fact that the CNT did not carry out the
**political** aspect of the revolution meant that the revolution in the
economy was doomed to failure. As Leval stressed, in *"the industrial
collectives, especially in the large towns, matters proceeded
differently as a consequence of contradictory factors and of opposition
created by the co-existence of social currents emanating from different
social classes."* [Gaston Leval, **Collectives in the Spanish
Revolution**, pp. 227-8 and p. 227]

That the initial forms of the revolution were not as expected should,
perhaps, be unsurprising. After all, no social transformation ever
exactly matches the hopes of those who had advocated it and the people
had more pressing matters to attend to such as re-starting production
and fighting Franco. So it is utterly understandable that the
collectives only embodied some and not all aspects of aims of the CNT
and FAI! Moreover, social change does not produce instant perfect
transformations and the workers *"had to build new circuits of
consumption and distribution, new types of social relations between the
proletariat and the peasantry, and new modes of production."* [Abel Paz,
**Durruti in the Spanish Revolution**, p. 451] That process was started,
even if it were initially incomplete. That a wider goal was envisioned
by these organisations can be seen from the fact that union activists
sought to extend the degree of socialisation. So, and again in line with
libertarian theory, the collectives also expressed a desire to
co-operate within and across industries (see [section
I.3.5](secI3.html#seci35)). These attempts at federation and
co-ordination will be discussed in [next section](secI8.html#seci84),
along with some of the conclusions that can be drawn from these
experiments. For, as would be expected, this attempt to introduce
libertarian socialism had its drawbacks as well as successes.

I.8.4 How were the Spanish industrial collectives co-ordinated?
---------------------------------------------------------------

The methods of co-operation tried by the collectives varied
considerably. Initially, there were very few attempts to co-ordinate
economic activities beyond the workplace. This is hardly surprising,
given that the overwhelming need was to restart production, convert a
civilian economy to a wartime one and to ensure that the civilian
population and militias were supplied with necessary goods. This lead to
a situation of anarchist mutualism developing, with many collectives
selling the product of their own labour on the market.

This lead to some economic problems as there existed no framework of
institutions between collectives to ensure efficient co-ordination of
activity and so lead to pointless competition between collectives (which
led to even more problems). As there were initially no confederations of
collectives nor mutual/communal banks this lead to the continuation of
any inequalities that initially existed between collectives (due to the
fact that workers took over rich and poor capitalist firms) and it made
the many ad hoc attempts at mutual aid between collectives difficult and
often of an ad hoc nature.

Given that the CNT programme of libertarian communism recognised that a
fully co-operative society must be based upon production for use, CNT
militants fought against this system of mutualism and for
inter-workplace co-ordination. They managed to convince their fellow
workers of the difficulties of mutualism by free debate and discussion
within their unions and collectives. Given this the degree of
socialisation varied over time (as would be expected). Initially, after
the defeat of Franco's forces, there was little formal co-ordination and
organisation. The most important thing was to get production started
again. However, the needs of co-ordination soon became obvious (as
predicted in anarchist theory and the programme of the CNT). Gaston
Leval gives the example of Hospitalet del Llobregat with regards to this
process:

> *"Local industries went through stages almost universally adopted in
> that revolution . . . [I]n the first instance, **comites** nominated
> by the workers employed in them [were organised]. Production and sales
> continued in each one. But very soon it was clear that this situation
> gave rise to competition between the factories . . . creating
> rivalries which were incompatible with the socialist and libertarian
> outlook. So the CNT launched the watchword: 'All industries must be
> ramified in the Syndicates, completely socialised, and the regime of
> solidarity which we have always advocated be established once and for
> all.'*

> *"The idea won support immediately."* [**Collectives in the Spanish
> Revolution**, pp. 291-2]

Another example was the woodworkers' union which had a massive debate on
socialisation and decided to do so (the shopworkers' union had a similar
debate, but the majority of workers rejected socialisation). According
to Ronald Fraser a *"union delegate would go round the small shops,
point out to the workers that the conditions were unhealthy and
dangerous, that the revolution was changing all this, and secure their
agreement to close down and move to the union-built Double-X and the 33
EU."* [Ronald Fraser, **Blood of Spain**, p. 222]

A plenum of syndicates met in December of 1936 and formulated norms for
socialisation in which the inefficiency of the capitalist industrial
system was analysed. The report of the plenum stated:

> *"The major defect of most small manufacturing shops is fragmentation
> and lack of technical/commercial preparation. This prevents their
> modernisation and consolidation into better and more efficient units
> of production, with better facilities and co-ordination . . . For us,
> socialisation must correct these deficiencies and systems of
> organisation in every industry . . . To socialise an industry, we must
> consolidate the different units of each branch of industry in
> accordance with a general and organic plan which will avoid
> competition and other difficulties impeding the good and efficient
> organisation of production and distribution."* [quoted by Souchy,
> **Anarchist Collectives**, p. 83]

As Souchy pointed out, this document is very important in the evolution
of collectivisation, because it indicates a realisation that *"workers
must take into account that partial collectivisation will in time
degenerate into a kind of bourgeois co-operativism."* [**Op. Cit.**, p.
83] Thus many collectives did not compete with each other for profits,
as surpluses were pooled and distributed on a wider basis than the
individual collective.

This process went on in many different unions and collectives and,
unsurprisingly, the forms of co-ordination agreed to lead to different
forms of organisation in different areas and industries, as would be
expected in a free society. However, the two most important forms can be
termed syndicalisation and confederationalism (we will ignore the forms
created by the collectivisation decree as these were not created by the
workers themselves).

***Syndicalisation*** (our term) meant that the CNT's industrial union
ran the whole industry. This solution was tried by the woodworkers'
union after extensive debate. One section of the union, *"dominated by
the FAI, maintained that anarchist self-management meant that the
workers should set up and operate autonomous centres of production so as
to avoid the threat of bureaucratisation."* However, those in favour of
syndicalisation won the day and production was organised in the hands of
the union, with administration posts and delegate meetings elected by
the rank and file. However, the *"major failure . . . (and which
supported the original anarchist objection) was that the union became
like a large firm"* and its *"structure grew increasingly rigid."*
[Ronald Fraser, **Blood of Spain**, p. 222] According to one militant,
*"From the outside it began to look like an American or German trust"*
and the workers found it difficult to secure any changes and *"felt they
weren't particularly involved in decision making."* [quoted by Fraser,
**Op. Cit.**, p. 222 and p. 223] However, this did not stop workers
re-electing almost all posts at the first Annual General Assembly.

In the end, the major difference between the union-run industry and a
capitalist firm organisationally appeared to be that workers could vote
for (and recall) the industry management at relatively regular General
Assembly meetings. While a vast improvement on capitalism, it is hardly
the best example of participatory self-management in action. However, it
must be stressed that the economic problems caused by the Civil War and
Stalinist led counter-revolution obviously would have had an effect on
the internal structure of any industry and so we cannot say that the
form of organisation created was totally responsible for any
marginalisation that took place.

The other important form of co-operation was what we will term
***confederalisation***. This system was based on horizontal links
between workplaces (via the CNT union) and allowed a maximum of
self-management **and** mutual aid. This form of co-operation was
practised by the Badalona textile industry (and had been defeated in the
woodworkers' union). It was based upon each workplace being run by its
elected management, selling its own production, getting its own orders
and receiving the proceeds. However, *"everything each mill did was
reported to the union which charted progress and kept statistics. If the
union felt that a particular factory was not acting in the best
interests of the collectivised industry as a whole, the enterprise was
informed and asked to change course."* This system ensured that the
*"dangers of the big 'union trust' as of the atomised collective were
avoided."* [Fraser, **Op. Cit.**, p. 229] According to one militant, the
union *"acted more as a socialist control of collectivised industry than
as a direct hierarchised executive."* The federation of collectives
created *"the first social security system in Spain"* (which included
retirement pay, free medicines, sick and maternity pay) and a
compensation fund was organised *"to permit the economically weaker
collectives to pay their workers, the amount each collective contributed
being in direct proportion to the number of workers employed."* [quoted
by Fraser, **Op. Cit.**, p. 229]

As can be seen, the industrial collectives co-ordinated their activity
in many ways, with varying degrees of success. As would be expected,
mistakes were made and different solutions found as an anarchist society
can hardly be produced "overnight" (as discussed in [section
H.2.5](secH2.html#sech25), anarchists have always been aware that social
transformation takes time). So it is hardly surprising that the workers
of the CNT faced numerous problems and had to develop their
self-management experiment as objective conditions allowed them to.
Unfortunately, thanks to fascist aggression and Communist Party and
Republican back-stabbing, the experiment did not last long enough to
fully answer all the questions we have about the viability of the
solutions tried. Given time, however, we are sure they would have solved
the problems they faced for the social experimentation which was
conducted was not only highly successful but also rich in promise.

I.8.5 How were the Spanish agricultural co-operatives organised and co-ordinated?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Jose Peirats described collectivisation among the peasantry as follows:

> *"The expropriated lands were turned over to the peasant syndicates,
> and it was these syndicates that organised the first collectives.
> Generally the holdings of small property owners were respected, always
> on the condition that only they or their families would work the land,
> without employing wage labour. In areas like Catalonia, where the
> tradition of petty peasant ownership prevailed, the land holdings were
> scattered. There were no great estates. Many of these peasants,
> together with the CNT, organised collectives, pooling their land,
> animals, tools, chickens, grain, fertiliser, and even their harvested
> crops.*

> "Privately owned farms located in the midst of collectives interfered
> with efficient cultivation by splitting up the collectives into
> disconnected parcels. To induce owners to move, they were given more
> or even better land located on the perimeter of the collective.
> "The collectivist who had nothing to contribute to the collective was
> admitted with the same rights and the same duties as the others. In
> some collectives, those joining had to contribute their money
> (Girondella in Catalonia, Lagunarrotta in Aragón, and Cervera del
> Maestra in Valencia)." [**The Anarchist Collectives**, p. 112]

Dolgoff observed that *"supreme power was vested in, and actually
exercised by, the membership in general assemblies, and all power
derived from, and flowed back to, the grass roots organisations of the
people."* [**Op. Cit.**, p 119fn] Peirats also noted that the
collectives were *"fiercely democratic"* as regards decision-making. For
example, in Ademuz *"assemblies were held every Saturday"* while in
Alcolea de Cinca *"they were held whenever necessary."* [**Anarchists in
the Spanish Revolution**, p. 146] Eyewitness Gaston Leval summarised
this explosion in self-management as follows:

> *"Regular general membership meetings were convoked weekly, bi-weekly,
> or monthly . . . and these meetings were completely free of the
> tensions and recriminations which inevitably emerge when the power of
> decisions is vested in a few individuals -- even if democratically
> elected. The Assemblies were open for everyone to participate in the
> proceedings. Democracy embraced all social life. In most cases, even
> the 'individualists' who were not members of the collective could
> participate in the discussions, and they were listened to by the
> collectivists."* [**The Anarchist Collectives**, p 119fn]

Work was *"usually done in groups on a co-operative basis. In smaller
collectives, all workers gathered to discuss the work needed to be done
and how to allocate it. In larger collectives, representatives of each
work group would gather at regular intervals. General assemblies of the
collective met on a weekly, biweekly, or monthly basis, and took up
issues ranging from hours and wages to the distribution of food and
clothing."* [Martha A. Ackelsberg in **Free Women of Spain**, p. 106] It
was in these face-to-face assemblies that decisions upon the
distribution of resources were decided both within and outwith the
collective. Here, when considering the importance of mutual aid, appeals
were made to an individual's sense of empathy. As one activist
remembered:

> *"There were, of course, those who didn't want to share and who said
> that each collective should take care of itself. But they were usually
> convinced in the assemblies. We would try to speak to them in terms
> they understood. We'd ask, 'Did you think it was fair when the
> **cacique** [local boss] let people starve if there wasn't enough
> work?' and they said, 'Of course not.' They would eventually come
> around. Don't forget, there were three hundred thousand collectivists
> [in Aragón], but only ten thousand of us had been members of the CNT.
> We had a lot of educating to do."* [quoted by Ackelsberg, **Op.
> Cit.**, p. 107]

In addition, regional federations of collectives were formed in many
areas of Spain (for example, in Aragón and the Levant). The federations
were created at congresses to which the collectives in an area sent
delegates. These congresses agreed a series of general rules about how
the federation would operate and what commitments the affiliated
collectives would have to each other. The congress elected an
administration council, which took responsibility for implementing
agreed policy. The Levant Federation was organised as follows:

> *"The 900 Collectives were brought together in 54 cantonal federations
> which grouped themselves and at the same time subdivided into five
> provincial federations which at the top level ended in the Regional
> **Comite** . . . [This] was nominated directly by the annual
> congresses answerable to them and to the hundreds of peasant delegates
> chosen by their comrades . . . . It was also on their initiative that
> the Levante Federation was divided into 26 general sections in
> accordance with specialisations in work and other activities. Those 26
> sections constituted a whole which embraced probably for the first
> time in history outside the State and governmental structures, the
> whole of social life."* [Gaston Leval, **Collectives in the Spanish
> Revolution**, p. 154]

The Aragón Federation statues were agreed at its founding congress in
mid-February 1937 by 500 delegates. These stated that there would be
*"as many county federations"* as deemed *"necessary for the proper
running of the collectives"* and the Federation would *"hold its
ordinary congress at intervals of six months, in addition to whatever
extraordinary ones . . . deemed appropriate."* New collectives could
join after *"consent in general assembly of the inhabitants of the
collective"*. The federation aimed to *"coordinate the economic
potential of the region and . . . be geared towards solidarity in
accordance with the norms of autonomy and federalism."* [quoted by Jose
Peirats, **The CNT in the Spanish Revolution**, vol. 1, p. 240]

These federations had many tasks. They ensured the distribution of
surplus produce to the front line and to the cities, cutting out
middlemen and ensuring the end of exploitation. They also arranged for
exchanges between collectives to take place. In addition, the
federations allowed the individual collectives to pool resources
together in order to improve the infrastructure of the area (building
roads, canals, hospitals and so on) and invest in means of production
which no one collective could afford. In this way individual collectives
pooled their resources, increased and improved the means of production
ad the social and economic infrastructure of their regions. All this,
combined with an increase of consumption in the villages and towns as
well as the feeding of militia men and women fighting the fascists at
the front.

Rural collectivisations allowed the potential creative energy that
existed among the rural workers and peasants to be unleashed, an energy
that had been wasted under private property. The popular assemblies
allowed community problems and improvements to be identified and solved
directly, drawing upon the ideas and experiences of everyone and
enriched by discussion and debate. To quote one participant: *"We were
always prepared to adapt our ideas in every area of collective life if
things did not work. That was the advantage of our collectives over
state-created ones like those in Russia. We were free. Each village
could do as it pleased. There was local stimulus, local initiative."*
[quoted by Ronald Fraser, **Blood of Spain**, p. 357] As we discuss in
the the [next section](secI8.html#seci86), this enabled rural Spain to
be transformed from one marked by poverty and fear into one of increased
well-being and hope.

I.8.6 What did the agricultural collectives accomplish?
-------------------------------------------------------

Most basically, self-management in collectives combined with
co-operation in rural federations allowed an improvement in quality of
rural life. From a purely economic viewpoint, production increased and
as historian Benjamin Martin summarises: *"Though it is impossible to
generalise about the rural land take-overs, there is little doubt that
the quality of life for most peasants who participated in co-operatives
and collectives notably improved."* [**The Agony of Modernisation**, p.
394] Another historian, Antony Beevor, notes that *"[i]n terms of
production and improved standards for the peasants, the self-managed
collectives appear to have been successful. They also seem to have
encouraged harmonious community relations."* [**The Spanish Civil War**,
p. 95]

More importantly, however, this improvement in the quality of life
included an increase in freedom as well as in consumption. To re-quote
the member of the Beceite collective in Aragón: *"it was marvellous . .
. to live in a collective, a free society where one could say what one
thought, where if the village committee seemed unsatisfactory one could
say. The committee took no big decisions without calling the whole
village together in a general assembly. All this was wonderful."*
[quoted by Ronald Fraser, **Blood of Spain**, p. 288] As Beevor
suggests, *"self-managed collectives were much happier when no better
off than before. What mattered was that the labourers ran their own
collectives -- a distinct contrast to the disasters of state
collectivisation in the Soviet Union."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 95] Here are a
few examples provided by Jose Peirats:

> *"In Montblanc the collective dug up the old useless vines and planted
> new vineyards. The land, improved by modern cultivation with tractors,
> yielded much bigger and better crops . . . Many Aragón collectives
> built new roads and repaired old ones, installed modern flour mills,
> and processed agricultural and animal waste into useful industrial
> products. Many of these improvements were first initiated by the
> collectives. Some villages, like Calanda, built parks and baths.
> Almost all collectives established libraries, schools, and cultural
> centres."* [**The Anarchist Collectives**, p. 116]

Gaston Leval pointed out that *"the Peasant Federation of Levant . . .
produced more than half of the total orange crop in Spain: almost four
million kilos (1 kilo equals about 2 and one-fourth pounds). It then
transported and sold through its own commercial organisation (no
middlemen) more than 70% of the crop. (The Federation's commercial
organisation included its own warehouses, trucks, and boats. Early in
1938 the export section established its own agencies in France:
Marseilles, Perpignan, Bordeaux, Cherbourg, and Paris.) Out of a total
of 47,000 hectares in all Spain devoted to rice production, the
collective in the Province of Valencia cultivated 30,000 hectares."*
[**Op. Cit.**, p. 124] To quote Peirats again:

> *"Preoccupation with cultural and pedagogical innovations was an event
> without precedent in rural Spain. The Amposta collectivists organised
> classes for semi-literates, kindergartens, and even a school of arts
> and professions. The Seros schools were free to all neighbours,
> collectivists or not. Grau installed a school named after its most
> illustrious citizen, Joaquin Costa. The Calanda collective (pop. only
> 4,500) schooled 1,233 children. The best students were sent to the
> Lyceum in Caspe, with all expenses paid by the collective. The
> Alcoriza (pop. 4,000) school was attended by 600 children. Many of the
> schools were installed in abandoned convents. In Granadella (pop.
> 2,000), classes were conducted in the abandoned barracks of the Civil
> Guards. Graus organised a print library and a school of arts and
> professions, attended by 60 pupils. The same building housed a school
> of fine arts and high grade museum. In some villages a cinema was
> installed for the first time. The Penalba cinema was installed in a
> church. Viladecana built an experimental agricultural laboratory.*
> [**Op. Cit.**, p. 116]

Peirats summed up the accomplishments of the agricultural collectives as
follows:

> *"In distribution the collectives' co-operatives eliminated middlemen,
> small merchants, wholesalers, and profiteers, thus greatly reducing
> consumer prices. The collectives eliminated most of the parasitic
> elements from rural life, and would have wiped them out altogether if
> they were not protected by corrupt officials and by the political
> parties. Non-collectivised areas benefited indirectly from the lower
> prices as well as from free services often rendered by the collectives
> (laundries, cinemas, schools, barber and beauty parlours, etc.)."*
> [**Op. Cit.**, p. 114]

Leval emphasised the following achievements (among others):

> *"In the agrarian collectives solidarity was practised to the greatest
> degree. Not only was every person assured of the necessities, but the
> district federations increasingly adopted the principle of mutual aid
> on an inter-collective scale. For this purpose they created common
> reserves to help out villages less favoured by nature. In Castile
> special institutions for this purpose were created. In industry this
> practice seems to have begun in Hospitalet, on the Catalan railways,
> and was applied later in Alcoy. Had the political compromise not
> impeded open socialisation, the practices of mutual aid would have
> been much more generalised . . . A conquest of enormous importance was
> the right of women to livelihood, regardless of occupation or
> function. In about half of the agrarian collectives, the women
> received the same wages as men; in the rest the women received less,
> apparently on the principle that they rarely live alone . . . In all
> the agrarian collectives of Aragón, Catalonia, Levant, Castile,
> Andalusia, and Estremadura, the workers formed groups to divide the
> labour or the land; usually they were assigned to definite areas.
> Delegates elected by the work groups met with the collective's
> delegate for agriculture to plan out the work. This typical
> organisation arose quite spontaneously, by local initiative . . . In
> addition . . . the collective as a whole met in weekly, bi-weekly or
> monthly assembly . . . The assembly reviewed the activities of the
> councillors it named, and discussed special cases and unforeseen
> problems. All inhabitants -- men and women, producers and
> non-producers -- took part in the discussion and decisions . . . In
> land cultivation the most significant advances were: the rapidly
> increased use of machinery and irrigation; greater diversification;
> and forestation. In stock raising: the selection and multiplication of
> breeds; the adaptation of breeds to local conditions; and large-scale
> construction of collective stock barns."* [**Op. Cit.**, pp. 166-167]

Collectivisation, as Graham Kelsey notes, *"allowed a rationalisation of
village societies and a more efficient use of the economic resources
available. Instead of carpenters and bricklayers remaining idle because
no wealthy landowner had any use for their services they were put to
work constructing agricultural facilities and providing the villages
with the kind of social amenities which until then they had scarcely
been able to imagine."* [**Anarchosyndicalism, Libertarian Communism and
the State**, p. 169] Martha A. Ackelsberg sums up the experience well:

> *"The achievements of these collectives were extensive. In many areas
> they maintained, if not increased, agricultural production [not
> forgetting that many young men were at the front line], often
> introducing new patterns of cultivation and fertilisation . . .
> collectivists built chicken coups, barns, and other facilities for the
> care and feeding of the community's animals. Federations of
> collectives co-ordinated the construction of roads, schools, bridges,
> canals and dams. Some of these remain to this day as lasting
> contributions of the collectives to the infrastructure of rural Spain.
> The collectivists also arranged for the transfer of surplus produce
> from wealthier collectives to those experiencing shortages, either
> directly from village to village or through mechanisms set up by
> regional committees."* [**The Free Women of Spain**, pp. 106-7]

As well as this inter-collective solidarity, the rural collectives also
supplied food to the front-line troops:

> *"The collectives voluntarily contributed enormous stocks of
> provisions and other supplies to the fighting troops. Utiel sent 1,490
> litres of oil and 300 bushels of potatoes to the Madrid front (in
> addition to huge stocks of beans, rice, buckwheat, etc.). Porales de
> Tujana sent great quantities of bread, oil, flour, and potatoes to the
> front, and eggs, meat, and milk to the military hospital.*

> *"The efforts of the collectives take on added significance when we
> take into account that their youngest and most vigorous workers were
> fighting in the trenches. 200 members of the little collective of
> Vilaboi were at the front; from Viledecans, 60; Amposta, 300; and
> Calande, 500."* [Jose Peirats, **The Anarchist Collectives**, p. 120]

Therefore, as well as significant economic achievements, the collectives
ensured social and political ones too. Solidarity was practised and
previously marginalised people took direct and full management of the
affairs of their communities, transforming them to meet their own needs
and desires.

I.8.7 Were the rural collectives created by force?
--------------------------------------------------

No, they were not. The myth that the rural collectives were created by
"terror," organised and carried out by the anarchist militia, was
started by the Stalinists of the Spanish Communist Party. More recently,
certain right-wing "libertarians" have warmed up and repeated these
Stalinist fabrications. Anarchists have been disproving these
allegations since 1936 and it is worthwhile to do so again here. As
Vernon Richards noted: *"However discredited Stalinism may appear to be
today the fact remains that the Stalinist lies and interpretation of the
Spanish Civil War still prevail, presumably because it suits the
political prejudices of those historians who are currently interpreting
it."* [*"Introduction"*, Gaston Leval, **Collectives in the Spanish
Revolution**, p. 11] Here we shall present evidence to refute claims
that the rural collectives were created by force.

Firstly, we should point out that rural collectives were created in many
different areas of Spain, such as the Levant (900 collectives), Castile
(300) and Estremadera (30), where the anarchist militia did not exist.
In Catalonia, for example, the CNT militia passed through many villages
on its way to Aragón and only around 40 collectives were created unlike
the 450 in Aragón. In other words, the rural collectivisation process
occurred independently of the existence of anarchist troops, with the
majority of the 1,700 rural collectives created in areas without a
predominance of anarchist militias.

One historian, Ronald Fraser, seems to imply that collectives were
imposed upon the Aragón population. As he put it, the
*"collectivisation, carried out under the general cover, if not
necessarily the direct agency, of CNT militia columns, represented a
revolutionary minority's attempt to control not only production but
consumption for egalitarian purposes and the needs of the war."* Notice
that he does not suggest that the anarchist militia actually **imposed**
the collectives, a claim for which there is little or no evidence.
Moreover, Fraser presents a somewhat contradictory narrative to the
facts he presents. On the one hand, he suggests that *"[o]bligatory
collectivisation was justified, in some libertarians' eyes, by a
reasoning closer to war communism than to libertarian communism."* On
the other hand, he presents extensive evidence that the collectives did
not have a 100% membership rate. How can collectivisation be obligatory
if people remain outside the collectives? Similarly, he talks of how
**some** CNT militia leaders justified *"[f]orced collectivisation"* in
terms of the war effort while acknowledging the official CNT policy of
opposing forced collectivisation, an opposition expressed in practice as
only around 20 (i.e., 5%) of the collectives were total. [**Blood of
Spain**, p. 370, p. 349 and p. 366] This is shown in his own book as
collectivists interviewed continually note that people remained outside
their collectives!

Thus Fraser's attempts to paint the Aragón collectives as a form of
*"war communism"* imposed upon the population by the CNT and obligatory
for all fails to co-incidence with the evidence he presents.

Fraser states that *"[t]here was no need to dragoon them [the peasants]
at pistol point [into collectives]: the coercive climate, in which
'fascists' were being shot, was sufficient. 'Spontaneous' and 'forced'
collectives existed, as did willing and unwilling collectivists within
them."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 349] Therefore, his implied suggestion that
the Aragón collectives were imposed upon the rural population is based
upon the insight that there was a *"coercive climate"* in Aragón at the
time. Of course a civil war against fascism would produce a *"coercive
climate"* particularly near the front line. However, the CNT can hardly
be blamed for that. As historian Gabriel Jackson summarised, while such
executions took place the CNT did not conduct a general wave of terror:

> *"the anarchists made a constant effort to separate active political
> enemies from those who were simply bourgeois by birth or ideology or
> economic function. Anarchist political committees wanted to know what
> the accused monarchists or conservatives had done, not simply what
> they thought or how they voted . . . There is no inherent
> contradiction involved in recognising both that the revolution
> included some violence and that its social and economic results . . .
> were approved of by the majority of peasants in an area."* [quoted in
> Jose Peirats, **The CNT in the Spanish Revolution**, vol. 1, p. 146]

This was a life and death struggle against fascism, in which the
fascists were systematically murdering vast numbers of anarchists,
socialists and republicans in the areas under their control. It is
hardly surprising that some anarchist troops took the law into their own
hands and murdered some of those who supported and would help the
fascists. Given what was going on in fascist Spain, and the experience
of fascism in Germany and Italy, the CNT militia knew exactly what would
happen to them and their friends and family if they lost.

The question does arise, however, of whether the climate was made so
coercive by the war and the nearness of the anarchist militia that
individual choice was impossible. The facts speak for themselves. At its
peak, rural collectivisation in Aragón embraced around 70% of the
population in the area saved from fascism. Around 30% of the population
felt safe enough not to join a collective, a sizeable percentage. If the
collectives had been created by anarchist terror or force, we would
expect a figure of 100% membership. This was not the case, indicating
the basically voluntary nature of the experiment (we should point out
that other figures suggest a lower number of collectivists which makes
the forced collectivisation argument even less likely). Historian Antony
Beevor (while noting that there *"had undoubtedly been pressure, and no
doubt force was used on some occasions in the fervour after the
rising"*) just stated the obvious when he wrote that *"the very fact
that every village was a mixture of collectivists and individualists
shows that peasants had not been forced into communal farming at the
point of a gun."* [**The Spanish Civil War**, p. 206] In addition, if
the CNT militia had forced peasants into collectives we would expect the
membership of the collectives to peak almost overnight, not grow slowly
over time:

> *"At the regional congress of collectives, held at Caspe in
> mid-February 1937, nearly 80 000 collectivists were represented from
> 'almost all the villages of the region.' This, however, was but a
> beginning. By the end of April the number of collectivists had risen
> to 140,000; by the end of the first week of May to 180,000; and by the
> end of June to 300,000."* [Graham Kelsey, *"Anarchism in Aragón,"* pp.
> 60-82, **Spain in Conflict 1931-1939**, Martin Blinkhorn (ed.), p. 61]

If the collectives had been created by force, then their membership
would have been 300,000 in February, 1937, not increasing steadily to
reach that number four months later. Neither can it be claimed that the
increase was due to new villages being collectivised, as almost all
villages had sent delegates in February. This indicates that many
peasants joined the collectives because of the advantages associated
with common labour, the increased resources it placed at their hands and
the fact that the surplus wealth which had in the previous system been
monopolised by the few was used instead to raise the standard of living
of the entire community.

The voluntary nature of the collectives is again emphasised by the
number of collectives which allowed people to remain outside. There
*"were few villages which were completely collectivised."* [Beevor,
**Op. Cit.**, p. 94] One eye-witness in Aragón, an anarchist
schoolteacher, noted that the forcing of smallholders into a collective
*"wasn't a widespread problem, because there weren't more than twenty or
so villages where collectivisation was total and no one was allowed to
remain outside."* [quoted by Fraser, **Op. Cit.**, p. 366] Instead of
forcing the minority in a village to agree with the wishes of the
majority, the vast majority (95%) of Aragón collectives stuck to their
libertarian principles and allowed those who did not wish to join to
remain outside.

So, only around 20 were *"total"* collectives (out of 450) and around
30% of the population felt safe enough **not** to join. In other words,
in the vast majority of collectives those joining could see that those
who did not were safe. These figures indicate of the basically
spontaneous and voluntary nature of the movement as do the composition
of the new municipal councils created after July 19th. As Graham Kesley
notes: *"What is immediately noticeable from the results is that
although the region has often been branded as one controlled by
anarchists to the total exclusion of all other forces, the CNT was far
from enjoying the degree of absolute domination often implied and
inferred."* [**Anarchosyndicalism, Libertarian Communism and the
State**, p. 198]

In his account of the rural revolution, Burnett Bolloten noted that it
*"embraced more than 70 percent of the population"* in liberated Aragón
and that *"many of the 450 collectives of the region were largely
voluntary"* although *"it must be emphasised that this singular
development was in some measure due to the presence of militiamen from
the neighbouring region of Catalonia, the immense majority of whom were
members of the CNT and FAI."* [**The Spanish Civil War**, p. 74] This,
it should be noted, was not denied by anarchists. As Gaston Leval
pointed out, *"it is true that the presence of these forces . . .
favoured indirectly these constructive achievements by preventing active
resistance by the supporters of the bourgeois republic and of fascism."*
[**Collectives in the Spanish Revolution**, p. 90]

So the presence of the militia changed the balance of class forces in
Aragón by destroying the capitalist state (i.e. the local bosses --
caciques -- could not get state aid to protect their property) and many
landless workers took over the land. The presence of the militia ensured
that land could be taken over by destroying the capitalist "monopoly of
force" that existed before the revolution (the power of which will be
highlighted below) and so the CNT militia allowed the possibility of
experimentation by the Aragónese population. This class war in the
countryside is reflected by Bolloten: *"If the individual farmer viewed
with dismay the swift and widespread collectivisation of agriculture,
the farm workers of the Anarchosyndicalist CNT and the Socialist UGT saw
it as the commencement of a new era."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 63] Both were
mass organisations and supported collectivisation.

Therefore, anarchist militias allowed the rural working class to abolish
the artificial scarcity of land created by private property (and
enforced by the state). The rural bosses obviously viewed with horror
the possibility that they could not exploit day workers' labour (as
Bolloten pointed out *"the collective system of agriculture threaten[ed]
to drain the rural labour market of wage workers."* [**Op. Cit.**, p.
62]). Little wonder the richer peasants and landowners hated the
collectives. A report on the district of Valderrobes which indicates
popular support for the collectives:

> *"Collectivisation was nevertheless opposed by opponents on the right
> and adversaries on the left. If the eternally idle who have been
> expropriated had been asked what they thought of collectivisation,
> some would have replied that it was robbery and others a dictatorship.
> But, for the elderly, the day workers, the tenant farmers and small
> proprietors who had always been under the thumb of the big landowners
> and heartless usurers, it appeared as salvation."* [quoted by
> Bolloten, **Op. Cit.**, p. 71]

However, many historians ignore the differences in class that existed in
the countryside and explain the rise in collectives in Aragón (and
ignore those elsewhere) as the result of the CNT militia. For example,
Fraser:

> *"Very rapidly collectives . . . began to spring up. It did not happen
> on instructions from the CNT leadership -- no more than had the
> [industrial] collectives in Barcelona. Here, as there, the initiative
> came from CNT militants; here, as there, the 'climate' for social
> revolution in the rearguard was created by CNT armed strength: the
> anarcho-syndicalists' domination of the streets of Barcelona was
> re-enacted in Aragón as the CNT militia columns, manned mainly by
> Catalan anarcho-syndicalist workers, poured in. Where a nucleus of
> anarcho-syndicalists existed in a village, it seized the moment to
> carry out the long-awaited revolution and collectivised spontaneously.
> Where there was none, villagers could find themselves under
> considerable pressure from the militias to collectivise."* [**Op.
> Cit.**, p. 347]

Fraser implies that the revolution was mostly imported into Aragón from
Catalonia. However, as he himself notes, the CNT column leaders (except
Durruti) *"opposed"* the creation of the Council of Aragón (a
confederation for the collectives). Hardly an example of Catalan CNT
imposed social revolution! Moreover, the Aragón CNT was a widespread and
popular organisation, suggesting that the idea that the collectives were
imported into the region by the Catalan CNT is simply **false**. Fraser
states that in *"some [of the Aragónese villages] there was a
flourishing CNT, in others the UGT was strongest, and in only too many
there was no unionisation at all."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 350 and p. 348]
The question arises of how extensive was that strength. The evidence
shows that the rural CNT in Aragón was extensive, strong and growing, so
making the suggestion of imposed collectives a false one. In fact, by
the 1930s the *"authentic peasant base of the CNT . . . lay in Aragón."*
CNT growth in Zaragoza *"provided a springboard for a highly effective
libertarian agitation in lower Aragón, particularly among the
impoverished labourers and debt-ridden peasantry of the dry steppes
region."* [Murray Bookchin, **The Spanish Anarchists**, p. 203]

Graham Kelsey, in his social history of the CNT in Aragón between 1930
and 1937, provides more evidence on this matter. He points out that as
well as the *"spread of libertarian groups and the increasing
consciousness among CNT members of libertarian theories . . .
contribu[ting] to the growth of the anarchosyndicalist movement in
Aragón"* the existence of *"agrarian unrest"* also played an important
role in that growth. This all lead to the *"revitalisation of the CNT
network in Aragón"*. So by 1936, the CNT had built upon the
*"foundations laid in 1933"* and *"had finally succeeded in translating
the very great strength of the urban trade-union organisation in
Zaragoza into a regional network of considerable extent."* [**Op.
Cit.**, pp. 80-81, p. 82 and p. 134]

Kelsey notes the long history of anarchism in Aragón, dating back to the
late 1860s. However, before the 1910s there had been little gains in
rural Aragón by the CNT due to the power of local bosses (called
**caciques**):

> *"Local landowners and small industrialists, the **caciques** of
> provincial Aragón, made every effort to enforce the closure of these
> first rural anarchosyndicalist cells [created after 1915]. By the time
> of the first rural congress of the Aragónese CNT confederation in the
> summer of 1923, much of the progress achieved through the
> organisation's considerable propaganda efforts had been countered by
> repression elsewhere."* [*"Anarchism in Aragón"*, **Op. Cit.**, p. 62]

A CNT activist indicated the power of these bosses and how difficult it
was to be a union member in Aragón:

> *"Repression is not the same in the large cities as it is in the
> villages where everyone knows everybody else and where the Civil
> Guards are immediately notified of a comrade's slightest movement.
> Neither friends nor relatives are spared. All those who do not serve
> the state's repressive forces unconditionally are pursued, persecuted
> and on occasions beaten up."* [quoted by Kelsey, **Op. Cit.**, p. 74]

However, while there were some successes in organising rural unions,
even in 1931 *"propaganda campaigns which led to the establishment of
scores of village trade-union cells, were followed by a
counter-offensive from village **caciques** which forced them to
close."* [**Op. Cit.** p. 67] Even in the face of this repression the
CNT grew and *"from the end of 1932"* there was *"a successful expansion
of the anarchosyndicalist movement into several parts of the region
where previously it had never penetrated."* [Kesley,
**Anarchosyndicalism, Libertarian Communism and the State**, p. 185]
This growth was built upon in 1936, with increased rural activism which
had slowly eroded the power of the **caciques** (which in part explains
their support for the fascist coup). After the election of the Popular
Front, years of anarchist propaganda and organisation paid off with
*"dramatic growth in rural anarcho-syndicalist support"* in the six
weeks after the general election. This *"was emphasised"* in the Aragón
CNT's April congress's agenda and it was decided to direct *"attention
to rural problems"* while the agreed programme was *"exactly what was to
happen four months later in liberated Aragón."* In its aftermath, a
series of intensive propaganda campaigns was organised through each of
the provinces of the regional confederation. Many meetings were held in
villages which had never before heard anarcho-syndicalist propaganda.
This was very successful and by the beginning of June, 1936, the number
of Aragón unions had topped 400, compared to only 278 one month earlier.
[Kesley, *"Anarchism in Aragón"*, **Op. Cit.**, pp. 75-76]

This increase in union membership reflected increased social struggle by
the Aragónese working population and their attempts to improve their
standard of living, which was very low for most of the population. A
journalist from the conservative Catholic **Heraldo de Aragón** visited
lower Aragón in the summer of 1935 and noted *"[t]he hunger in many
homes, where the men are not working, is beginning to encourage the
youth to subscribe to misleading teachings."* [quoted by Kesley, **Op.
Cit.**, p. 74] Little wonder, then, the growth in CNT membership and
social struggle Kesley indicates:

> *"Evidence of a different kind was also available that militant trade
> unionism in Aragón was on the increase. In the five months between
> mid-February and mid-July 1936 the province of Zaragoza experienced
> over seventy strikes, more than had previously been recorded in any
> entire year, and things were clearly no different in the other two
> provinces . . . the great majority of these strikes were occurring in
> provincial towns and villages. Strikes racked the provinces and in at
> least three instances were actually transformed into general
> strikes."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 76]

So in the spring and summer of 1936 there was a massive growth in CNT
membership which reflected the growing militant struggle by the urban
and rural population of Aragón. Years of propaganda and organising had
ensured this growth in libertarian influence, a growth which was
reflected in the creation of collectives in liberated Aragón during the
revolution. Therefore, the construction of a collectivised society was
founded directly upon the emergence, during the five years of the Second
Republic, of a mass trade-union movement infused by anarchist
principles. These collectives were constructed in accordance with the
programme agreed at the Aragón CNT conference of April 1936 which
reflected the wishes of the rural membership of the unions within Aragón
(and due to the rapid growth of the CNT afterwards obviously reflected
popular feelings in the area):

*"libertarian dominance in post-insurrection Aragón itself reflected the
predominance that anarchists had secured before the war; by the summer
of 1936 the CNT had succeeded in establishing throughout Aragón a mass
trade-union movement of strictly libertarian orientation, upon which
widespread and well-supported network the extensive collective
experiment was to be founded."* [Kesley, **Op. Cit.**, p. 61]

Additional evidence that supports a high level of CNT support in rural
Aragón can be provided by the fact that it was Aragón that was the
centre of the December 1933 insurrection organised by the CNT. As
Bookchin noted, *"only Aragón rose on any significant scale,
particularly Saragossa . . . many of the villages declared libertarian
communism and perhaps the heaviest fighting took place between the
vineyard workers in Rioja and the authorities"*. [**Op. Cit.**, p. 238]
It is unlikely for the CNT to organise an insurrection in an area within
which it had little support or influence. According to Kesley, *"it was
precisely those areas which had most important in December 1933"* which
were in 1936 *"seeking to create a new pattern of economic and social
organisation, to form the basis of libertarian Aragón."*
[**Anarchosyndicalism, Libertarian Communism and the State**, p. 161]

So the majority of collectives in Aragón were the product of CNT (and
UGT) influenced workers taking the opportunity to create a new form of
social life, a form marked by its voluntary and directly democratic
nature. For from being unknown in rural Aragón, the CNT was well
established and growing at a fast rate: *"Spreading out from its urban
base . . . the CNT, first in 1933 and then more extensively in 1936,
succeeded in converting an essentially urban organisation into a truly
regional confederation."* [Kesley, **Op. Cit.**, p. 184]

The evidence suggests that historians like Fraser are wrong to imply
that the Aragón collectives were created by the CNT militia and enforced
upon a unwilling population. The Aragón collectives were the natural
result of years of anarchist activity within rural Aragón and directly
related to the massive growth in the CNT between 1930 and 1936. Thus
Kesley is correct to state that libertarian communism and agrarian
collectivisation *"were not economic terms or social principles enforced
upon a hostile population by special teams of urban
anarchosyndicalists."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 161] This is not to suggest
that there were **no** examples of people joining collectives
involuntarily because of the *"coercive climate"* of the front line nor
that there were villages which did not have a CNT union within them
before the war and so created a collective because of the existence of
the CNT militia. It is to suggest that these can be considered as
exceptions to the rule.

Moreover, the way the CNT handled such a situation is noteworthy. Fraser
indicates such a situation in the village of Alloza. In the autumn of
1936, representatives of the CNT district committee had come to suggest
that the villagers collectivise (we would like to stress here that the
CNT militia which had passed through the village had made no attempt to
create a collective there). A village assembly was called and the CNT
members explained their ideas and suggested how to organise the
collective. However, who would join and how the villagers would organise
the collective was left totally up to them (the CNT representatives
*"stressed that no one was to be maltreated"*). Within the collective,
self-management was the rule and one member recalled that *"[o]nce the
work groups were established on a friendly basis and worked their own
lands, everyone got on well enough."* *"There was no need for coercion,
no need for discipline and punishment . . . A collective wasn't a bad
idea at all."* [Fraser, **Op. Cit.**, p. 360] This collective, like the
vast majority, was voluntary and democratic: *"I couldn't oblige him to
join; we weren't living under a dictatorship."* [quoted by Fraser, **Op.
Cit.**, p. 362] In other words, **no** force was used to create the
collective and the collective was organised by local people directly.

Of course, as with any public good (to use economic jargon), all members
of the community had to pay for the war effort and feed the militia. As
Kelsey notes, *"[t]he military insurrection had come at a critical
moment in the agricultural calendar. Throughout lower Aragón there were
fields of grain ready for harvesting . . . At the assembly in Albalate
de Cinca the opening clause of the agreed programme had required
everyone in the district, independent farmers and collectivists alike,
to contribute equally to the war effort, thereby emphasising one of the
most important considerations in the period immediately following the
rebellion."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 164] In addition, the collectives
controlled the price of crops in order to ensure that speculation and
inflation were controlled. However, these policies as with the equal
duties of individualists and collectivists in the war effort were
enforced upon the collectives by the war.

Lastly, in support of the popular nature of the rural collectives, we
will indicate the effects of the suppression of the collectives in
August 1937 by the Communists, namely the collapse of the rural economy.
This sheds considerable light on the question of popular attitudes.

In October 1937, the Communist-controlled Regional Delegation of
Agrarian Reform acknowledged that *"in the majority of villages
agricultural work was paralysed causing great harm to our agrarian
economy."* This is confirmed by Jose Silva, a Communist Party member and
general secretary of the Institute of Agrarian Reform, who commented
that after Lister had attacked Aragón, *"labour in the fields was
suspended almost entirely, and a quarter of the land had not been
prepared at the time for sowing."* At a meeting of the agrarian
commission of the Aragónese Communist Party (October 9th, 1937), Silva
emphasised *"the little incentive to work of the entire peasant
population"* and that the situation brought about by the dissolution of
the collectives was *"grave and critical."* [quoted by Bolloten, **Op.
Cit.**, p. 530] Jose Peirats explained the reasons for this economic
collapse as a result of popular boycott:

> *"When it came time to prepare for the next harvest, smallholders
> could not by themselves work the property on which they had been
> installed [by the communists]. Dispossessed peasants, intransigent
> collectivists, refused to work in a system of private property, and
> were even less willing to rent out their labour."* [**Anarchists in
> the Spanish Revolution**, p. 258]

If the collectives were unpopular, created by anarchist force, then why
did the economy collapse after the suppression? If Lister had overturned
a totalitarian anarchist regime, why did the peasants not reap the
benefit of their toil? Could it be because the collectives were
essentially a spontaneous Aragónese development and supported by most of
the population there? This analysis is supported by historian Yaacov
Oved:

> *"Those who were responsible for this policy [of attacking the Aragón
> collectives], were convinced that the farmers would greet it joyfully
> because they had been coerced into joining the collectives. But they
> were proven wrong. Except for the rich estate owners who were glad to
> get their land back, most of the members of the agricultural
> collectives objected and lacking all motivation they were reluctant to
> resume the same effort in the agricultural work. This phenomenon was
> so widespread that the authorities and the communist minister of
> agriculture were forced to retreat from their hostile policy."*
> [**"Communismo Libertario" and Communalism in the Spanish
> Collectivisations (1936-1939)**, pp. 53-4]

Even in the face of Communist repression, most of the collectives kept
going. This, if nothing else, proves that the collectives were popular
institutions. *"Through the widespread reluctance of collectivists to
co-operate with the new policy,"* Oved argues, *"it became evident that
most members had voluntarily joined the collectives and as soon as the
policy was changed a new wave of collectives was established. However,
the wheel could not be turned back. An atmosphere of distrust prevailed
between the collectives and the authorities and every initiative was
curtailed"* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 54]

Jose Peirats summed up the situation after the communist attack on the
collectives and the legalisation of the collectives as follows:

> *"It is very possible that this second phase of collectivisation
> better reflects the sincere convictions of the members. They had
> undergone a severe test and those who had withstood it were proven
> collectivists. Yet it would be facile to label as anti-collectivists
> those who abandoned the collectives in this second phase. Fear,
> official coercion and insecurity weighed heavily in the decisions of
> much of the Aragónese peasantry."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 258]

While the collectives had existed, there was a 20% increase in
production (and this is compared to the pre-war harvest which had been
*"a good crop"* [Fraser, **Op. Cit.**p. 370]). After the destruction of
the collectives, the economy collapsed. Hardly the result that would be
expected if the collectives were forced upon an unwilling peasantry (the
forced collectivisation by Stalin in Russia resulted in a famine). Only
the victory of fascism made it possible to restore the so-called
"natural order" of capitalist property in the Spanish countryside. The
same land-owners who welcomed the Communist repression of the
collectives also, we are sure, welcomed the fascists who ensured a
lasting victory of property over liberty.

So, overall, the evidence suggests that the Aragón collectives, like
their counterparts in the Levante, Catalonia and so on, were **popular**
organisations, created by and for the rural population and, essentially,
an expression of a spontaneous and popular social revolution. Claims
that the anarchist militia created them by force of arms are **false.**
While acts of violence **did** occur and some acts of coercion **did**
take place (against CNT policy, we may add) these were the exceptions to
the rule. Bolloten's summary best fits the facts:

> *"But in spite of the cleavages between doctrine and practice that
> plagued the Spanish Anarchists whenever they collided with the
> realities of power, it cannot be overemphasised that notwithstanding
> the many instances of coercion and violence, the revolution of July
> 1936 distinguished itself from all others by the generally spontaneous
> and far-reaching character of its collectivist movement and by its
> promise of moral and spiritual renewal. Nothing like this spontaneous
> movement had ever occurred before."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 78]

I.8.8 But did the Spanish collectives innovate?
-----------------------------------------------

Yes. In contradiction to the old capitalist claim that no one will
innovate unless private property exists, the workers and peasants
exhibited much more incentive and creativity under libertarian socialism
than they had under the private enterprise system. This is apparent from
Gaston Leval's description of the results of collectivisation in
Cargagente in the southern part of the province of Valencia:

> *"The climate of the region is particularly suited for the cultivation
> of oranges . . . All of the socialised land, without exception, is
> cultivated with infinite care. The orchards are thoroughly weeded. To
> assure that the trees will get all the nourishment needed, the
> peasants are incessantly cleaning the soil. 'Before,' they told me
> with pride, 'all this belonged to the rich and was worked by miserably
> paid labourers. The land was neglected and the owners had to buy
> immense quantities of chemical fertilisers, although they could have
> gotten much better yields by cleaning the soil . . .' With pride, they
> showed me trees that had been grafted to produce better fruit.*

> *"In many places I observed plants growing in the shade of the orange
> trees. 'What is this?,' I asked. I learned that the Levant peasants
> (famous for their ingenuity) have abundantly planted potatoes among
> the orange groves. The peasants demonstrate more intelligence than all
> the bureaucrats in the Ministry of Agriculture combined. They do more
> than just plant potatoes. Throughout the whole region of the Levant,
> wherever the soil is suitable, they grow crops. They take advantage of
> the four month [fallow period] in the rice fields. Had the Minister of
> Agriculture followed the example of these peasants throughout the
> Republican zone, the bread shortage problem would have been overcome
> in a few months."* [**Anarchist Collectives**, p. 153]

This is just one from a multitude of examples presented in the accounts
of both the industrial and rural collectives. We have already noted some
examples of the improvements in efficiency realised by collectivisation
during the Spanish Revolution ([section I.4.10](secI4.html#seci410)).
Another example was the baking industry. Souchy reported that, *"[a]s in
the rest of Spain, Barcelona's bread and cakes were baked mostly at
night in hundreds of small bakeries. Most of them were in damp, gloomy
cellars infested with roaches and rodents. All these bakeries were shut
down. More and better bread and cake were baked in new bakeries equipped
with new modern ovens and other equipment."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 82] In
Granollers, the syndicate *"was at all times a prime-mover. All kinds of
initiatives tending to improve the operation and structure of the local
economy could be attributed to it."* The collectivised hairdressing,
shoe-making, wood-working and engineering industries were all improved,
with small, unhealthy and inefficient workplaces closed and replaced by
larger, more pleasant and efficient establishments. *"Socialisation went
hand in hand with rationalisation."* [Gaston Leval, **Collectives in the
Spanish Revolution**, p. 287] For more see
[sectionI.8.6](secI8.html#seci86) as well as [section
C.2.8](secC2.html#secc28) (in which we present more examples when
refuting the charge that workers' control would stifle innovation).

The substantial evidence available, of which these examples are but a
small number, proves that the membership of the collectives showed a
keen awareness of the importance of investment and innovation in order
to increase production, to make work both lighter and more interesting
**and** that the collectives allowed that awareness to be expressed
freely. The collectives indicate that, given the chance, everyone will
take an interest in their own affairs and express a desire to use their
minds to improve their lives and surroundings. In fact, capitalism
distorts what innovation exists under hierarchy by channelling it purely
into how to save money and maximise investor profit, ignoring other,
more important, issues. As Gaston Leval suggested, self-management
encouraged innovation:

> *"The theoreticians and partisans of the liberal economy affirm that
> competition stimulates initiative and, consequently, the creative
> spirit and invention without which it remains dormant. Numerous
> observations made by the writer in the Collectives, factories and
> socialised workshops permit him to take quite the opposite view. For
> in a Collective, in a grouping where each individual is stimulated by
> the wish to be of service to his fellow beings, research, the desire
> for technical perfection and so on are also stimulated. But they also
> have as a consequence that other individuals join those who were first
> to get together. Furthermore, when, in present society, an
> individualist inventor discovers something, it is used only by the
> capitalist or the individual employing him, whereas in the case of an
> inventor living in a community not only is his discovery taken up and
> developed by others, but is immediately applied for the common good. I
> am convinced that this superiority would very soon manifest itself in
> a socialised society."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 347]

Therefore the actual experiences of self-management in Spain supports
the points made in [section I.4.11](secI4.html#seci411). Freed from
hierarchy, individuals will creatively interact with the world to
improve their circumstances. For the human mind is an active agent and
unless crushed by authority it can no more stop thinking and acting than
the Earth can stop revolving round the Sun. In addition, the Collectives
indicate that self-management allows ideas to be enriched by discussion.

The experience of self-management proved Bakunin's point that society is
collectively more intelligent than even the most intelligent individual
simply because of the wealth of viewpoints, experience and thoughts
contained there. Capitalism impoverishes individuals and society by its
artificial boundaries and authority structures.

I.8.9 Why, if it was so good, did it not survive?
-------------------------------------------------

Just because something is good does not mean that it will survive. For
example, the Warsaw Ghetto uprising against the Nazis failed but that
does not mean that the uprising was a bad cause or that the Nazi regime
was correct, far from it. Similarly, while the experiments in workers'
self-management and free communes undertaken across Republican Spain is
one of the most important social experiments in a free society ever
undertaken, this cannot change the fact that Franco's forces and the
Communists had access to more and better weapons.

Faced with the aggression and terrorism of Franco, and behind him the
military might of Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany, the treachery of the
Communists, and the aloofness of the Western "democratic" states (whose
policy of "non-intervention" was strangely ignored when their citizens
aided Franco) it is amazing the revolution lasted as long as it did.

This does not excuse the actions of the anarchists themselves. As is
well known, the CNT co-operated with the other anti-fascist parties and
trade unions on the Republican side ultimately leading to anarchists
joining the government (see [next section](secI8.html#seci810)). This
co-operation helped ensure the defeat of the revolution. While much of
the blame can be placed at the door of the would-be "leaders" (who like
most leaders started to think themselves irreplaceable), it must be
stated that the rank-and-file of the movement did little to stop them.
Most of the militant anarchists were at the front-line (and so excluded
from union and collective meetings) and so could not influence their
fellow workers (it is no surprise that the radical *"Friends of
Durruti"* anarchist group were mostly ex-militia men). However, it seems
that the mirage of anti-fascist unity proved too much for the majority
of CNT members (see [section I.8.12](secI8.html#seci812)).

A few anarchists still maintain that the Spanish anarchist movement had
no choice and that collaboration (while having unfortunate effects) was
the only choice available. This view was defended by Sam Dolgoff and
finds some support in the writings of Gaston Leval, August Souchy and
other participants in the revolution. However, most anarchists today
oppose collaboration and think it was a terrible mistake (at the time,
this position was held by the majority of non-Spanish anarchists plus a
large minority of the Spanish movement, becoming a majority as the
implications of collaboration became clear). This viewpoint finds its
best expression in Vernon Richard's **Lessons of the Spanish
Revolution** and, in part, in such works as **Anarchists in the Spanish
Revolution** by Jose Peirats, **Anarchist Organisation: The History of
the FAI** by Juan Gomaz Casas and **Durruti in the Spanish Revolution**
by Abel Paz as well as in a host of pamphlets and articles written by
anarchists ever since.

So, regardless of how good a social system is, objective facts will
overcome that experiment. Saturnino Carod (a leader of a CNT Militia
column at the Aragón Front) summed up the successes of the revolution as
well as its objective limitations:

> *"Always expecting to be stabbed in the back, always knowing that if
> we created problems, only the enemy across the lines would stand to
> gain. It was a tragedy for the anarcho-syndicalist movement; but it
> was a tragedy for something greater -- the Spanish people. For it can
> never be forgotten that it was the working class and peasantry which,
> by demonstrating their ability to run industry and agriculture
> collectively, allowed the republic to continue the struggle for
> thirty-two months. It was they who created a war industry, who kept
> agricultural production increasing, who formed militias and later
> joined the army. Without their creative endeavour, the republic could
> not have fought the war . . ."* [quoted by Ronald Fraser, **Blood of
> Spain**, p. 394]

So, regardless of its benefits, regardless of its increase in liberty
and equality, the revolution was defeated. This should not blind us to
its achievements or the potential it expressed. Rather, it should be
used both as a source of inspiration and lessons.

I.8.10 Why did the CNT collaborate with the state?
--------------------------------------------------

As is well know, in September 1936 the CNT joined the Catalan
government, followed by the central government in November. This flowed
from the decision made on July 21st to not speak of Libertarian
Communism until after Franco had been defeated. In other words, to
collaborate with other anti-fascist parties and unions in a common front
against fascism. This decision, initially, involved the CNT agreeing to
join a *"Central Committee of Anti-Fascist Militias"* proposed by the
leader of the Catalan government, Louis Companys. This committee was
made up of representatives of various anti-fascist parties and groups.
From this it was only a matter of time until the CNT joined an official
government as no other means of co-ordinating activities existed (see
[section I.8.13](secI8.html#seci813)).

The question must arise, **why** did the CNT decide to collaborate with
the state, forsake its principles and, in its own way, contribute to the
counter-revolution and the loosing of the war. This is an important
question. Indeed, it is one Marxists always throw up in arguments with
anarchists or in anti-anarchist diatribes. Does the failure of the CNT
to implement anarchism after July 19th mean that anarchist politics are
flawed? Or, rather, does the experience of the CNT and FAI during the
Spanish revolution indicate a failure of **anarchists** rather than of
**anarchism,** a mistake made under difficult objective circumstances
and one which anarchists have learnt from? Needless to say, anarchists
argue that the latter is correct. In other words, as Vernon Richards
argued, *"the basis of [this] criticism is not that anarchist ideas were
proved to be unworkable by the Spanish experience, but that the Spanish
anarchists and syndicalists failed to put their theories to the test,
adopting instead the tactics of the enemy."* [**Lessons of the Spanish
Revolution**, p. 14]

So, why **did** the CNT collaborate with the state during the Spanish
Civil War? Simply put, rather than being the fault of anarchist theory
(as Marxists like to claim), its roots can be discovered in the
situation facing the Catalan anarchists on July 20th. The objective
conditions facing the leading militants of the CNT and FAI influenced
the decisions they took, decisions which they later justified by
**mis**-using anarchist theory.

What was the situation facing the Catalan anarchists on July 20th?
Simply put, it was an unknown situation, as the report made by the CNT
to the **International Workers Association** made clear:

> *"Levante was defenceless and uncertain . . . We were in a minority in
> Madrid. The situation in Andalusia was unknown . . . There was no
> information from the North, and we assumed the rest of Spain was in
> the hands of the fascists. The enemy was in Aragón, at the gates of
> Catalonia. The nervousness of foreign consular officials led to the
> presence of a great number of war ships around our ports."* [quoted by
> Jose Peirats, **Anarchists in the Spanish Revolution**, p. 180]

Anarchist historian Jose Peirats noted that according to the report
*"the CNT was in absolute control of Catalonia in July 19, 1936, but its
strength was less in Levante and still less in central Spain where the
central government and the traditional parties were dominant. In the
north of Spain the situation was confused. The CNT could have mounted an
insurrection on its own 'with probable success' but such a take-over
would have led to a struggle on three fronts: against the fascists, the
government and foreign capitalism. In view of the difficulty of such an
undertaking, collaboration with other antifascist groups was the only
alternative."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 179] In the words of the CNT report
itself:

> *"The CNT showed a conscientious scrupulousness in the face of a
> difficult alternative: to destroy completely the State in Catalonia,
> to declare war against the Rebels [i.e. the fascists], the government,
> foreign capitalism, and thus assuming complete control of Catalan
> society; or collaborating in the responsibilities of government with
> the other antifascist fractions."* [quoted by Robert Alexander, **The
> Anarchists in the Spanish Civil War**, vol. 2, p. 1156]

Moreover, as Gaston Leval later argued, given that the *"general
preoccupation"* of the majority of the population was *"to defeat the
fascists . . . the anarchists would, if they came out against the state,
provoke the antagonism . . . of the majority of the people, who would
accuse them of collaborating with Franco."* Implementing an anarchist
revolution would, in all likelihood, also result in *"the instant
closing of the frontier and the blockade by sea by both fascists and the
democratic countries. The supply of arms would be completely cut off,
and the anarchists would rightly be held responsible for the disastrous
consequences."* [**The Anarchist Collectives**, p. 52 and p. 53]

While the supporters of Lenin and Trotsky will constantly point out the
objective circumstances in which their heroes made their decisions
during the Russian Revolution, they rarely mention those facing the
anarchists in Spain on the 20th of July, 1936. It seems hypocritical to
point to the Russian Civil War as the explanation of all of the
Bolsheviks' crimes against the working class (indeed, humanity) while
remaining silent on the forces facing the CNT-FAI at the start of the
Spanish Civil War. The fact that **if** the CNT had decided to implement
libertarian communism in Catalonia they would have to face the fascists
(commanding the bulk of the Spanish army), the Republican government
(commanding the rest) **plus** those sections in Catalonia which
supported the republic is rarely mentioned. Moreover, when the decision
to collaborate was made it was **immediately after the defeat of the
army uprising in Barcelona** -- the situation in the rest of the country
was uncertain and when the social revolution was in its early days.
Stuart Christie indicates the dilemma facing the leadership of the CNT
at the time:

> *"The higher committees of the CNT-FAI-FIJL in Catalonia saw
> themselves caught on the horns of a dilemma: social revolution,
> fascism or bourgeois democracy. Either they committed themselves to
> the solutions offered by social revolution, regardless of the
> difficulties involved in fighting both fascism and international
> capitalism, or, through fear of fascism (or of the people), they
> sacrificed their anarchist principles and revolutionary objectives to
> bolster, to become, part of the bourgeois state . . . Faced with an
> imperfect state of affairs and preferring defeat to a possibly Pyrrhic
> victory, the Catalan anarchist leadership renounced anarchism in the
> name of expediency and removed the social transformation of Spain from
> their agenda.*

> *"But what the CNT-FAI leaders failed to grasp was that the decision
> whether or not to implement Libertarian Communism, was not theirs to
> make. Anarchism was not something which could be transformed from
> theory into practice by organisational decree . . . [the] spontaneous
> defensive movement of 19 July had developed a political direct of its
> own."* [**We, the Anarchists!**, p. 99]

Given that the pro-fascist army still controlled a third or more of
Spain (including Aragón) and that the CNT was not the dominant force in
the centre and north of Spain, it was decided that a war on three fronts
would only aid Franco. Moreover, it was a distinct possibility that by
introducing libertarian communism in Catalonia, Aragón and elsewhere,
the workers' militias and self-managed industries would have been
starved of weapons, resources and credit. That isolation was a real
problem can be seen from Abad de Santillán's later comments on why the
CNT joined the government:

> *"The Militias Committee guaranteed the supremacy of the people in
> arms . . . but we were told and it was repeated to us endlessly that
> as long as we persisted in retaining it, that is, as long as we
> persisted in propping up the power of the people, weapons would not
> come to Catalonia, nor would we be granted the foreign currency to
> obtain them from abroad, nor would we be supplied with the raw
> materials for our industry. And since losing the war meant losing
> everything and returning to a state like that prevailed in the Spain
> of Ferdinand VII, and in the conviction that the drive given by us and
> our people could not vanish completely from the new economic life, we
> quit the Militias Committee to join the Generalidad government."*
> [quoted by Christie, **Op. Cit.**, p. 109]

It was decided to collaborate and reject the basic ideas of anarchism
until the war was over. A terrible mistake, but one which can be
understood given the circumstances in which it was made. This is not, we
stress, to justify the decision but rather to explain it and place it in
context. Ultimately, the **experience** of the Civil War saw a blockade
of Republic by both "democratic" and fascist governments, the starving
of the militias and self-managed collectives of resources and credit as
well as a war on two fronts when the State felt strong enough to try and
crush the CNT and the semi-revolution its members had started. Most CNT
members did not think that when faced with the danger of fascism, the
liberals, the right-wing socialists and communists would prefer to
undermine the anti-fascist struggle by attacking the CNT. They were
wrong and, in this, history proved Durruti totally correct:

> "For us it is a matter of crushing Fascism once and for all. Yes, and
> in spite of the Government.
>
> "No government in the world fights Fascism to the death. When the

> Spanish Revolution**, pp. 193-4f]

This desire to push the revolution further was not limited to Durruti,
as can be seen from this communication from the Catalan CNT leadership
in August 1936. It also expresses the fears driving the decisions which
had been made:

> *"Reports have also been received from other regions. There has been
> some talk about the impatience of some comrades who wish to go further
> than crushing fascism, but for the moment the situation in Spain as a
> whole is extremely delicate. In revolutionary terms, Catalonia is an

> *"Obviously no one can foresee the changes which may follow the civil
> war and the conquest of that part of Spain which is still under the
> control of mutinous reactionaries."* [quoted by Jose Peirats, **Op.
> Cit.**, pp. 151-2]

Isolation, the uneven support for a libertarian revolution across Spain
and the dangers of fascism were real problems, but they do not excuse
the libertarian movement for its mistakes. The biggest of these mistakes
was forgetting basic anarchist ideas and an anarchist approach to the
problems facing the Spanish people. If these ideas had been applied in
Spain, the outcome of the Civil War and Revolution could have been
different.

In summary, while the decision to collaborate is one that can be
understood (due to the circumstances under which it was made), it cannot
be justified in terms of anarchist theory. Indeed, as we argue in the
[next section](secI8.html#seci811), attempts by the CNT leadership to
justify the decision in terms of anarchist principles are not convincing
and cannot be done without making a mockery of anarchism.

I.8.11 Was the decision to collaborate a product of anarchist theory?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Marxist critics of Anarchism point to CNT's decision to collaborate with
the bourgeois state against Franco as the key proof that libertarian
socialism is flawed. Such a claim, anarchists reply, is false for rather
than being the product of anarchist ideology, the decision was made in
light of the immediate danger of fascism and the situation in other
parts of the country. The fact is that the circumstances in which the
decision to collaborate was made are rarely mentioned by Marxists. To
quote a sadly typical Marxist diatribe:

> *"This question of state power, and which class holds it, was to prove
> crucial for revolutionaries during the Spanish Civil War and in
> particular during the revolutionary upheavals in Catalonia. Here
> anarchism faced its greatest test and greatest opportunity, yet it
> failed the former and therefore missed the latter.*

> *"When the government in the region under the leadership of Companys
> admitted its impotence and offered to dissolve, effectively handing
> power to the revolutionary forces, the anarchists turned them down.
> CNT leader and FAI . . . militant Garcia Oliver explained, 'The CNT
> and the FAI decided on collaboration and democracy, renouncing
> revolutionary totalitarianism which would lead to the strangulation of
> the revolution by the anarchist and Confederal dictatorship. We had to
> choose, between Libertarian Communism, which meant anarchist
> dictatorship, and democracy, which meant collaboration.' The choice
> was between leaving the state intact and paving the way for Franco's
> victory or building a workers' government in Catalonia which could act
> as a focal point for the defeat of Franco and the creation of the
> structures of a new workers' state. In choosing the former the
> anarchists were refusing to distinguish between a capitalist state and
> a workers' state . . . The movement that started by refusing to build
> a workers' state ended up by recognising a capitalist one and
> betraying the revolution in the process."* [Pat Stack, *"Anarchy in
> the UK?"*, **Socialist Review**, no. 246]

There are four key flaws in this kind of argument. First, there is the
actual objective situation in which the decision to collaborate was made
in. Strangely, for all his talk of anarchists ignoring *"material
conditions"* when we discuss the Russian revolution, Stack fails to
mention any when he discusses Spain. As such, his critique is pure
idealism, without any attempt to ground it in the objective
circumstances facing the CNT and FAI. Second, the quote provided as the
only evidence for Stack's analysis dates from a year **after** the
decision was made. Rather than reflect the actual concerns of the CNT
and FAI at the time, they reflect the attempts of the leaders of an
organisation which had significantly departed from its libertarian
principles to justify their actions. While this obviously suits Stack's
idealist analysis of events, its use is flawed for that reason. Thirdly,
clearly the decision of the CNT and FAI **ignored** anarchist theory. As
such, it seems ironic to blame anarchism when anarchists ignores its
recommendations, yet this is what Stack does. Lastly, there is the
counter-example of Aragón, which clearly refutes Stack's case.

To understand why the CNT and FAI made the decisions it did, it is
necessary to do what Stack fails to do, namely to provide some context.
The decision to ignore anarchist theory, ignore the state rather than
smashing it and work with other anti-fascist organisations was made
immediately after the army had been defeated on the streets of Barcelona
on the 20th of July, 1936. As we indicated in the [last
section](secI8.html#seci810), the decision of the CNT to collaborate
with the state was driven by the fear of isolation. The possibility that
by declaring libertarian communism it would have had to fight the
Republican government and foreign interventions **as well as** the
military coup influenced the decision reached by the militants of
Catalan anarchism. They concluded that pursuing implementing anarchism
in the situation they faced would only aid Franco and result in a quick
defeat.

As such, the **real** choice facing the CNT was not *"between leaving
the state intact . . . or building a workers' government in Catalonia
which could act as a focal point for the defeat of Franco"* but rather
something drastically different: Either work with other anti-fascists
against Franco so ensuring unity against the common enemy and pursue
anarchism after victory **or** immediately implement libertarian
communism and possibly face a conflict on two fronts, against Franco
**and** the Republic (and, possibly, imperialist intervention against
the social revolution). This situation made the CNT-FAI decided to
collaborate with other anti-fascist groups in the Catalan **Central
Committee of Anti-Fascist Militias**. To downplay these objective
factors and the dilemma they provoked and instead simply blame the
decision on anarchist politics is a joke.

Similarly, the Garcia Oliver quote provided by Stack dated from July
1937. They were made as justifications of CNT-FAI actions and were
designed for political effect. As such, they simply cannot be taken at
face value for these two reasons. It is significant, though, that rather
than discuss the actual problems facing the CNT Marxists like Stack
prefer to ritualistically trot out a quote made over a year later. They
argue that it exposes the bankruptcy of anarchist theory. So convinced
of this, they rarely bother discussing the problems facing the CNT after
the defeat of the military coup nor do they compare these quotes to the
anarchist theory they claim inspired them.

There are good reasons for this. Firstly, if they presented the
objective circumstances the CNT found itself it then their readers may
see that the decision, while wrong, is understandable and had nothing to
do with anarchist theory. Secondly, by comparing this quote to anarchist
theory their readers would soon see how at odds they are with each
other. Indeed, Garcia Oliver invoked anarchism to justify conclusions
that were the exact **opposite** to what that theory actually
recommends!

So what can be made of Garcia Oliver's argument? As Abel Paz noted
*"[i]t is clear that the explanations given . . . were designed for
their political effect, hiding the atmosphere in which these decisions
were taken. These declarations were made a year later when the CNT were
already far removed from their original positions It is also the period
when they had become involved in the policy of collaboration which led
to them taking part in the Central Government. But in a certain way they
shed light on the unknown factors which weighted so heavily on these who
took part in the historic Plenum."* [**Durruti: The People Armed**, p.
215]

For example, when the decision was made, the revolution had not started
yet. The street fighting had just ended and the Plenum decided *"not to
speak about Libertarian Communism as long as part of Spain was in the
hands of the fascists."* [Mariano R. Vesquez, quoted by Paz, **Op.
Cit.**, p. 214] The revolution took place **from below** in the days
following the decision, independently of the wishes of the Plenum. In
the words of Abel Paz:

> *"When the workers reached their workplaces . . . they found them
> deserted . . . The major centres of production had been abandoned by
> their owners . . . The CNT and its leaders had certainly not foreseen
> this situation; if they had, they would have given appropriate
> guidance to the workers when they called off the General Strike and
> ordered a return to work. What happened next was the result of the
> workers' spontaneous decision to take matters into their own hands.*

> *"Finding the factories deserted, and no instructions from their
> unions, they resolved to operate the machines themselves."* [**The
> Spanish Civil War**, pp. 54-5]

The rank and file of the CNT, on their own initiative, took advantage of
the collapse of state power to transform the economy and social life of
Catalonia. Paz stressed that *"no orders were given for expropriation or
collectivisation -- which proved that the union, which represented the
will of their members until July 18th, had now been overtaken by
events"* and the *"union leaders of the CNT committees were confronted
with a revolution that they had not foreseen . . . the workers and
peasants had bypassed their leaders and taken collective action."*
[**Op. Cit.**, p. 40 and p. 56] As historian Ronald summarises the
*"revolutionary initiative had sprung not from the CNT's leading
committees -- how could it when the libertarian revolution had been
officially 'postponed'? -- but from individual CNT unions impelled by
the most advanced syndicalist militants."* So while the Catalan CNT
*"had 'put off' libertarian revolution . . . daily, the revolution in
Barcelona was taking root in CNT collectives and union-run industries."*
[**Blood of Spain**, p. 139 and p. 179]

As the revolution had not yet begun and the CNT Plenum had decided
**not** to call for its start, it is difficult to see how *"libertarian
communism"* (i.e. the revolution) could *"lead to the strangulation of
the revolution"* (i.e. libertarian communism). In other words, this
particular rationale put forward by Garcia Oliver could not reflect the
real thoughts of those present at the CNT plenum and so, obviously, was
a later justification for the CNT's actions. Moreover, the decision made
then clearly stated that Libertarian Communism would be back on the
agenda once Franco was defeated. Oliver's comments were applicable
**after** Franco was defeated just as much as on July 20th, 1936.

Similarly, Libertarian Communism is based on self-management, by its
nature opposed to dictatorship. According to the CNT's resolution at its
congress in Zaragoza in May, 1936, *"the foundation of this
administration will be the Commune"* which is *"autonomous"* and
*"federated at regional and national levels."* The commune *"will
undertake to adhere to whatever general norms [that] may be agreed by
majority vote after free debate."* [quoted by Jose Peirats, **The CNT in
the Spanish Revolution**, vol. 1, p. 106] It stressed the free nature of
society aimed at by the CNT:

Hardly a picture of *"anarchist dictatorship"*! Indeed, it is far more
democratic than the capitalist state Oliver described as *"democracy."*
So Oliver's arguments from 1937 are totally contradictory. After all, he
is arguing that libertarian communism (a society based on self-managed
free associations organised and run from the bottom up) is an
*"anarchist dictatorship"* and **less** democratic than the capitalist
Republic he had been fighting against between 1931 and 1936! Moreover,
libertarian communism **inspired** the revolution and so to reject it in
favour of capitalist democracy to stop *"the strangulation of the
revolution"* makes no sense.

Clearly, these oft quoted words of Garcia Oliver cannot be taken at face
value. Made in 1937, they present an attempt to misuse anarchist ideals
to defend the anti-anarchist activities of the CNT leadership rather
than a meaningful explanation of the decisions made on the 20th of July,
1936. It is safe to take his words with a large pinch of salt. To rely
upon them for an analysis of the actions of the Spanish Anarchists or
the failings of anarchism suggests an extremely superficial perspective.
This is particularly the case when we look at both the history of the
CNT and anarchist theory.

This can clearly been seen from the report made by the CNT to the
**International Workers Association** to justify the decision to forget
anarchist theory and collaborate with bourgeois parties and join the
government. The report states that *"the CNT, loyal to its ideals and
its purely anarchist nature, did not attack the forms of the State, nor
try publicly to penetrate or dominate it . . . none of the political or
juridical institutions were abolished."* [quoted by Robert Alexander,
**The Anarchists in the Spanish Civil War**, vol. 2, p. 1156] In other
words, according to this report, "anarchist" ideals do not, in fact,
mean the destruction of the state, but rather the **ignoring** of the
state. That this is nonsense, concocted to justify the CNT leaderships'
betrayal of its ideals, is clear. To prove this we just need to look at
Bakunin and Kropotkin and look at the activities of the CNT **before**
the start of the war.

According to anarchist ideas, to quote Bakunin, *"the revolution must
set out from the first to radically and totally destroy the State"* and
that the *"natural and necessary consequence of this destruction"* will
include the *"dissolution of army, magistracy, bureaucracy, police and
priesthood"* as well as the *"confiscation of all productive capital and
means of production on behalf of workers' associations, who are to put
them to use"*. The state would be replaced by *"the federative Alliance
of all working men's associations"* which *"will constitute the
Commune."* These communes, in turn, would *"constitute the federation of
insurgent associations . . . and organise a revolutionary force capable
of defeating reaction."* [**Michael Bakunin: Selected Writings**, pp.
170-1] For Kropotkin, the *"Commune . . . must break the State and
replace it by the Federation."* [**Words of a Rebel**, p. 83]

Thus anarchism has always been clear on what to do with the state, and
it is obviously not what the CNT did to it! The CNT ignored these
recommendations and so given that it did **not** destroy the state, nor
create a federation of workers' councils, then how can anarchist theory
be blamed? It seems strange to point to the failure of anarchists to
apply their politics as an example of the failure of those politics, yet
this is what the likes of Stack are doing.

Nor had the CNT always taken this perspective. Before the start of the
Civil War, the CNT had organised numerous insurrections against the
state. For example, in the spontaneous revolt of CNT miners in January
1932, the workers *"seized town halls, raised the black-and-red flags of
the CNT, and declared **communismo liberatario.**"* In Tarassa, the same
year, the workers again *"seiz[ed] town halls"* and the town was *"swept
by street fighting."* The revolt in January 1933 began with *"assaults
by Anarchist action groups . . . on Barcelona's military barracks . . .
Serious fighting occurred in working-class **barrios** and the outlying
areas of Barcelona . . . Uprising occurred in Tarassa,
Sardanola-Ripollet, Lerida, in several **pueblos** in Valencia province,
and in Andalusia."* In December 1933, the workers *"reared barricades,
attacked public buildings, and engaged in heavy street fighting . . .
many villages declared libertarian communism."* [Murray Bookchin, **The
Spanish Anarchists**, p. 225, p. 226, p. 227 and p. 238]

It seems that the CNT leadership's loyalty to *"its ideals and its
purely anarchist nature"* which necessitated *"not attack[ing] the forms
of the State"* was a very recent development!

As can be seen, the rationales later developed to justify the betrayal
of anarchist ideas and the revolutionary workers of Spain have no real
relationship to anarchist theory. They were created to justify a
non-anarchist approach to the struggle against fascism, an approach
based on ignoring struggle from below and instead forging alliances with
parties and unions at the top. This had been not always been the case.
Throughout the 1930s the UGT and Socialist Party had rejected the CNT's
repeated calls for a revolutionary alliance from below in favour of a
top-down *"Workers' Alliance"* which, they believed, would be the only
way which would allow them to control the labour movement. The CNT,
rightly, rejected such a position in favour of an alliance from the
bottom up yet, in July 1936, the need for unity was obvious and the UGT
was not changing its position. So while in Barcelona the state has been
destroyed in all but name, *"in Madrid, thanks to the Socialist Party,
bourgeois structures were left intact and even fortified: a semi-dead
state received a new lease of life and no dual power was created to
neutralise it."* [Abel Paz, **Durruti in the Spanish Revolution**, p.
462]

Rather than trying to cement a unity with other organisations at the top
level in July 1936, the leadership of the CNT should have applied their
anarchist ideas by inciting the oppressed to enlarge and consolidate
their gains (which they did anyway). This would have liberated all the
potential energy within the country (and elsewhere), energy that clearly
existed as can be seen from the spontaneous collectivisations that
occurred after the fateful Plenum of July 20th and the creation of
volunteer workers' militia columns sent to liberate those parts of Spain
which had fallen to Franco.

The role of anarchists, therefore, was that of *"inciting the people to
abolish capitalistic property and the institutions through which it
exercises its power for the exploitation of the majority by a minority"*
and *"to support, to incite and encourage the development of the social
revolution and to frustrate any attempts by the bourgeois capitalist
state to reorganise itself, which it would seek to do."* This would
involve *"seeking to destroy bourgeois institutions through the creation
of revolutionary organisms."* [Vernon Richards, **Lessons of the Spanish
Revolution**, p. 44, p. 46 and p. 193] In other words, to encourage, the
kind of federation of communities and workplaces Bakunin and Kropotkin
had called for.

Indeed, such an organisation already existing in embryo in the CNT's
**barrios** defence committees which had led and co-ordinated the
struggle against the military coup throughout Barcelona. *"The
Neighbourhood Committees, which had diverse names but all shared a
libertarian outlook, federated and created a revolutionary Local
Co-ordination Committee."* They *"became Revolutionary Committees and
formed what was called the 'Federation of Barricades.' It was the
Committees that held power in Barcelona that evening."* [Paz, **Op.
Cit.**, p. 470 and p. 445] Rather than collaborate with political
parties and the UGT at the top, in the Central Committee of Anti-Fascist
Militias, the CNT should have developed these organs of community
self-organisation:

> *"Power lay in the street on July 20, represented by the people in
> arms . . . Life took on a new momentum and it both destroyed and
> created as the people worked to resolve practical necessities born
> from a collective life that lived -- and wanted to continue living --
> in the street . . . The street and the people in arms were the living
> force of the revolution . . . The Defence Committees, now transformed
> into Revolutionary Committees, back up this force. They organised what
> was called the 'Federation of Barricades.' Militants, standing
> resolutely behind these barricades, represented them in the
> Revolutionary Committees."* [Paz, **Op. Cit.**, pp. 450-1]

Later, a delegate meeting from the various workplaces (whether
previously unionised or not) would have to had been arranged to
organise, to re-quote Bakunin, *"the federal Alliance of all working
men's associations"* which would *"constitute the Commune"* and
complement the *"federation of the barricades."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 170]
In more modern terminology, a federation of workers' councils combined
with a federation of workers' militias and community assemblies. Without
this, the revolution was doomed as was the war against Franco. A
minority of anarchists **did** see this genuinely libertarian solution
at the time, but sadly they were a minority. For example, the members of
the **Nosotros** Group, which included Durruti, thought *"it was
necessary to transcend the alliance between the CNT and the political
parties and create an authentic revolutionary organisation. That
organisation would rest directly on Barcelona's and Catalonia's unions
and Revolutionary Committees. Together, those groups would form a
Regional Assembly, which would be the revolution's executive body."*
[Paz, **Op. Cit.**, p. 471] Such a development, applying the basic ideas
of anarchism (and as expounded in the CNT's May resolution on
Libertarian Communism), was not an impossibility. After all, as we will
see, the CNT-FAI organised along those lines in Aragón.

Concern that Catalonia would be isolated from the rest of the Republic
was foremost in the minds of many in the CNT and FAI. The fear that if
libertarian communism was implemented then a civil war within the
anti-fascist forces would occur (so aiding Franco) was a real one.
Unfortunately, the conclusion draw from that fear, namely to win the war
against Franco before talking about the revolution, was the wrong one.
After all, a civil war within the Republican side **did** occur, when
the state had recovered enough to start it. Similarly, with the fear of
a blockade by foreign governments. This happened away, confirming the
analysis of activists like Durruti.

Organising a full and proper delegate meeting in the first days of the
revolution would have allowed all arguments and suggestions to be
discussed by the whole membership of the CNT and, perhaps, a different
decision may have been reached on the subject of collaboration. After
all, many CNT members were applying anarchist politics by fighting
fascism via a revolutionary war. This can be seen by the rank and file
of the CNT and FAI ignoring the decision to "postpone" the revolution in
favour of an anti-fascist war. All across Republican Spain, workers and
peasants started to expropriate capital and the land, placing it under
workers' self-management. They did so on their own initiative. It is
also possible, as discussed in the [next section](secI8.html#seci812),
that anti-fascist unity would have prevailed and so the some decision
would have been reached.

Be that as it may, by thinking they could postpone the revolution until
after the war, the CNT leadership made two mistakes. Firstly, they
should have known that their members would hardly miss this opportunity
to implement libertarian ideas so making their decision redundant (and a
statist backlash inevitable). Secondly, they abandoned their anarchist
ideas, failing to understand that the struggle against fascism would
never be effective without the active participation of the working
class. Such participation could never be achieved by placing the war
before the revolution and by working in top-down, statist structures or
within a state.

Indeed, the mistake made by the CNT, while understandable, cannot be
justified given that their consequences had been predicted by numerous
anarchists beforehand, including Kropotkin. Decades earlier in an essay
on the Paris Commune, the Russian anarchist refuted the two assumptions
of the CNT leadership -- first, of placing the war before the revolution
and, second, that the struggle could be waged by authoritarian
structures or a state. He explicitly attacked the mentality and logic of
those who argued *"Let us first make sure of victory, and then see what
can be done"*:

> *"Make sure of victory! As if there were any way of transforming
> society into a free commune without laying hands upon property! As if
> there were any way of defeating the enemy so long as the great mass of
> the people is not directly interested in the triumph of the
> revolution, in witnessing the arrival of material, moral and
> intellectual well-being for all! They sought to consolidate the
> Commune first of all while postponing the social revolution for later
> on, while the only effective way of proceeding was **to consolidate
> the Commune by the social revolution**!"* [**Words of a Rebel**, p.
> 97]

Kropotkin's argument was sound, as the CNT discovered. By waiting until
victory in the war they were defeated (as Abel Paz suggested, the
workers of Spain *"had to build a new world to secure and defend their
victory."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 451]). Kropotkin also indicated the
inevitable effects of the CNT's actions in co-operating with the state
and joining representative bodies:

> *"Paris . . . sent her devoted sons to the Hotel-de-Ville [town hall].
> Indeed, immobilised there by fetters of red tape, forced to discuss
> when action was needed, and losing the sensitivity that comes from
> continual contact with the masses, they saw themselves reduced to
> impotence. Paralysed by their distancing from the revolutionary centre
> -- the people -- they themselves paralysed the popular initiative."*
> [**Op. Cit.**, pp. 97-8]

Which, in a nutshell, was what happened to the leading militants of the
CNT who collaborated with the state. Kropotkin was proved right, as was
anarchist theory from Bakunin onwards. As Vernon Richards argued,
*"there can be no excuse"* for the CNT's decision, as *"they were not
mistakes of judgement but the deliberate abandonment of the principles
of the CNT."* [**Op. Cit.**, pp. 41-2] It seems difficult to blame
anarchist theory for the decisions of the CNT when that theory argues
the opposite position. That enemies of anarchism quote Garcia Oliver's
words from 1937 to draw conclusions about anarchist theory says more
about their politics than about anarchism!

Moreover, while the experience of Spain confirms anarchist theory
**negatively**, it also confirms it **positively** by the creation of
the Regional Defence Council of Aragón. The Council of Aragón was
created by a meeting of delegates from CNT unions, village collectives
and militia columns to protect the new society based on libertarian
communism the people of Aragón were building. The meeting also decided
to press for the setting up of a National Defence Committee which would
link together a series of regional bodies that were organised on
principles similar to the one now established in Aragón. Durruti
stressed that the collectives *"had to build their own means of
self-defence and not rely on the libertarian columns which would leave
Aragón as the war evolved. They needed to co-ordinate themselves,
although he also warned themselves an anti-fascist political front like
the type existing in other parts of Spain. They needn't make the same
error as their compatriots elsewhere . . . The popular assembly must be
sovereign."* After a CNT regional assembly militants decided to *"form
the Aragón Defence Council and the Aragón Federation of Collectives."*
[Paz, **Op. Cit.**, pp. 540-1] This exposes as false the claim that
anarchism failed during the Spanish Civil War. In Aragón, the CNT
**did** follow the ideas of anarchism, abolishing both the state and
capitalism. If they had did this in Catalonia, the outcome of the Civil
War may have been different.

The continuity of what happened in Aragón with the ideas of anarchism
and the CNT's 1936 Zaragoza Resolution on Libertarian Communism is
obvious. The formation of the Regional Defence Council was an
affirmation of commitment to the principles of libertarian communism.
This principled stand for revolutionary social and economic change
stands at odds with the claims that the Spanish Civil War indicates the
failure of anarchism. After all, in Aragón the CNT **did** act in
accordance with anarchist theory as well as in its own history and
politics. It created a federation of workers' associations as argued by
Bakunin. To contrast Catalonia and Aragón shows the weakness of Stack's
argument. The same organisation, with the same politics, yet different
results. How can anarchist ideas be blamed for what happened in
Catalonia when they had been applied in Aragón? Such a position could
not be logically argued and, unsurprisingly, Aragón usually fails to get
mentioned by Marxists when discussing Anarchism during the Spanish Civil
War.

Therefore, the activities of the CNT during the Civil War cannot be used
to discredit anarchism although it can be used to show that anarchists,
like everyone else, can and do make wrong decisions in difficult
circumstances. That Marxists always point to this event in anarchist
history is unsurprising, for it **was** a terrible mistake. Yet how
could anarchism have "failed" during the Spanish Revolution when it was
ignored in Catalonia (for fear of fascism) and applied in Aragón? How
can it be argued that anarchist politics were to blame when those very
same politics had formed the Council of Aragón? It cannot. Simply put,
the Spanish Civil War showed the failure of certain anarchists to apply
their ideas in a difficult situation rather than the failure of
anarchism. As Emma Goldman argued, the *"contention that there is
something wrong with Anarchism . . . because the leading comrades in
Spain failed Anarchism seems to be very faulty reasoning . . . the
failure of one or several individuals can never take away from the depth
and truth of an ideal."* [**Vision on Fire**, p. 299]

To use the Catalan CNT to generalise about anarchism is false as it,
firstly, requires a dismissal of the objective circumstances the
decision was made in and, secondly, it means ignoring anarchist theory
and history. It also gives the impression that anarchism as a
revolutionary theory must be evaluated purely from one event in its
history. The experiences of the Makhnovists in the Ukraine, the USI and
UAI in the factory occupations of 1920 and fighting fascism in Italy,
the insurrections of the CNT during the 1930s, the Council of Aragón
created by the CNT in the Spanish Revolution and so on, are all ignored.
Hardly convincing, although handy for Marxists. As is clear from, for
example, the experiences of the Makhnovists and the Council of Aragón,
that anarchism has been applied successfully on a large scale, both
politically and economically, in revolutionary situations.

Equally flawed are any attempts to suggest that those anarchists who
remained true to libertarian theory somehow, by so doing, rejected it
and moved towards Marxism. This is usually done to the anarchist group
the **Friends of Durruti** (FoD). In the words of Pat Stack:

> *"Interestingly the one Spanish anarchist group that developed the
> most sophisticated critique of all this was the Friends of Durutti
> [sic!]. As [Trotskyist] Felix Morrow points out, 'They represented a
> conscious break with the anti-statism of traditional anarchism. They
> explicitly declared the need for democratic organs of power, juntas or
> soviets, in the overthrow of capitalism, and the necessary state
> measures of repression against the counter-revolution.' The failure of
> the Spanish anarchists to understand exactly that these were the stark
> choices‚ workers' power, or capitalist power followed by reaction."*
> [**Op. Cit.**]

That Stack could not bother to spell Durruti's name correctly shows how
seriously we should take this analysis. The FoD were an anarchist
grouping within the CNT and FAI which, like a large minority of others,
strongly and consistently opposed the policy of anti-fascist unity.
Rather than signify a *"conscious break"* with anarchism, it signified a
conscious **return** to it. This can be clearly seen when we compare
their arguments to those of Bakunin. As noted by Stack, the FoD argued
for *"juntas"* in the overthrow of capitalism and to defend against
counter-revolution. Yet this was **exactly** what revolutionary
anarchists have argued for since Bakunin (see [section
H.2.1](secH2.html#sech21) for details). The continuity of the ideas of
the FoD with the pre-Civil War politics of the CNT and the ideas of
revolutionary anarchism are clear. As such, the FoD were simply arguing
for a return to the traditional positions of anarchism and cannot be
considered to have broken with it. If Stack or Morrow knew anything
about anarchism, then they would have known this.

As such, the failure of the Spanish anarchists was not the *"stark
choice"* between *"workers' power"* and *"capitalist power"* but rather
the making of the wrong choice in the real dilemma of introducing
anarchism (which would, by definition, be based on workers' power,
organisation and self-management) or collaborating with other
anti-fascist groups in the struggle against the greater enemy of Franco
(i.e. fascist reaction). That Stack does not see this suggests that he
simply has no appreciation of the dynamics of the Spanish Revolution and
prefers abstract sloganeering to a serious analysis of the problems
facing it. He ends by summarising:

> *"The most important lesson . . . is that whatever ideals and gut
> instincts individual anarchists may have, anarchism, both in word and
> deed, fails to provide a roadworthy vehicle for human liberation. Only
> Marxism, which sees the centrality of the working class under the
> leadership of a political party, is capable of leading the working
> class to victory."* [**Op. Cit.**]

As a useful antidote to these claims, we need simply quote Trotsky on
what the Spanish anarchists should have done. In his words: *"Because
the leaders of the CNT renounced dictatorship **for themselves** they
left the place open for the Stalinist dictatorship."* Hardly an example
of "workers' power"! Or, as he put it earlier in the same year, a
*"revolutionary party, even having seized power (of which the anarchist
leaders were incapable in spite of the heroism of the anarchist
workers), is still by no means the sovereign ruler of society."*
Ultimately, it was the case that the failure of the Spanish Revolution
confirmed for Trotsky the truism that the *"revolutionary dictatorship
of a proletarian party . . . is an objective necessity . . . The
revolutionary party (vanguard) which renounces **its own dictatorship**
surrenders the masses to the counter-revolution."* Rather than seeing,
as anarchist do, workers' councils as being key, Trotsky considered the
party, in fact the *"dictatorship of a party"*, as being the decisive
factor. [our emphasis, **Writings of Leon Trotsky 1936-37**, p. 514, p.
488 and pp. 513-4] At best, such organs would be used to achieve party
power and would simply be a fig-leaf for its rule (see [section
H.3.8](secH3.html#sech38)).

Clearly, the leading Marxist at the time was not arguing for the
*"centrality of the working class under the leadership of a political
party."* He was arguing for the dictatorship of a "revolutionary" party
***over*** the working class. Rather than the working class being
"central" to the running of a revolutionary regime, Trotsky saw the
party taking that position. What sort of *"victory"* is possible when
the party has dictatorial power over the working class and the
*"sovereign ruler"* of society? Simply the kind of "victory" that leads
to Stalinism. Rather than seeing working class organisations as the
means by which working people run society, Leninists see them purely in
instrumental terms -- the means by which the party can seize power. As
the Russian Revolution proved beyond doubt, in a conflict between
workers' power and party power Leninists will suppress the former to
ensure the latter.

To paraphrase Stack, the most important lesson from both the Russian and
Spanish revolutions is that whatever ideals and gut instincts individual
Leninists may have, Leninism, both in word and deed, fails to provide a
roadworthy vehicle for human liberation. Only Anarchism, which sees the
centrality of the working class self-management of the class struggle
and revolution, is capable of ensuring the creation of a real, free,
socialist society.

Lastly, it could be argued that our critique of the standard Leninist
attack on Spanish anarchism is similar to that presented by Leninists to
justify Bolshevik authoritarianism during the Russian Revolution. After
all, Leninists like Stack point to the objective circumstances facing
Lenin's regime -- its isolation, civil war and economic problems -- as
explaining its repressive actions. Yet any similarity is superficial as
the defeat of the Revolution in Spain was due to anarchists **not**
applying our ideas whole, while, in Russia, it was due to the Bolsheviks
**applying** their ideology. The difficulties that faced the Russian
Revolution pushed the Bolsheviks further down the road they where
already travelling down (not to mention that Bolshevik ideology
significantly contributed to making many of these problem worse). As we
discuss in [section H.6](secH6.html), the notion that "objective
circumstances" explains Bolshevik tyranny is simply unconvincing,
particularly given the role Bolshevik ideology played in this process.

So, to conclude, rather than show the failure of anarchism, the
experience of the Spanish Revolution indicates the failure of anarchists
to apply their ideas in practice. Faced with extremely difficult
circumstances, they compromised their ideas in the name of anti-fascist
unity. Their compromises **confirmed** rather than refuted anarchist
theory as they led to the defeat of both the revolution **and** the
civil war.

I.8.12 Was the decision to collaborate imposed on the CNT's membership?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

A few words have to be said about the development of the CNT and FAI
after the 19th of July, 1936. It is clear that both changed in nature
and were the not same organisations as they were **before** that date.
Both organisations became more centralised and bureaucratic, with the
membership excluded from many major decisions. As Peirats suggested:

> *"In the CNT and among militant anarchists there had been a tradition
> of the most scrupulous respect for the deliberations and decisions of
> the assemblies, the grassroots of the federalist organisation. Those
> who held administrative office had been merely the mandatories of
> those decisions. The regular motions adopted by the National
> congresses spelled out to the Confederation and its representative
> committees ineluctable obligations of a basic and general nature
> incumbent upon very affiliated member regardless of locality or
> region. And the forming of such general motions was the direct
> responsibility of all of the unions by means of motions adopted at
> their respective general assemblies. Similarly, the Regional or Local
> Congresses would establish the guidelines of requirement and problems
> that obtained only at regional or local levels. In both instances,
> sovereignty resided always with the assemblies of workers whether in
> their unions or in their groups.*

> *"This sense of rigorous, everyday federalist procedure was abruptly
> amended from the very outset of the revolutionary phase. . . This
> amendment of the norms of the organisation was explained away by
> reference to the exceptional turn of events, which required a greater
> agility of decisions and resolutions, which is to say a necessary
> departure from the circuitous procedures of federalist practice which
> operated from the bottom upwards."* [**The CNT in the Spanish
> Revolution**, vol. 1, p. 213]

In other words, the CNT had become increasingly hierarchical, with the
higher committees becoming transformed into executive bodies rather than
administrative ones as *"it is safe to assert that the significant
resolutions in the organisation were adopted by the committees, very
rarely by the mass constituency. Certainly, circumstances required quick
decisions from the organisation, and it was necessary to take
precautions to prevent damaging leaks. These necessities tempted the
committees to abandon the federalist procedures of the organisation."*
[Jose Peirats, **Anarchists in the Spanish Revolution**, p. 188]

Ironically, rather than the *"anarchist leaders"* of the CNT failing to
*"seize power"* as Trotsky and his followers lament (see [last
section](secI8.html#seci811)), they did -- **in their own
organisations.** Such a development proved to be a disaster and
re-enforced the anarchist critique against hierarchical and centralised
organisations. The CNT higher committees became isolated from the
membership, pursued their own policies and compromised and paralysed the
creative work being done by the rank and file -- as predicted in
anarchist theory. However, be that as it may, as we will indicate below,
it would be false to assert that these higher committees simply imposed
the decision to collaborate on their memberships (as, for example,
Vernon Richards seems to imply in his **Lessons of the Spanish
Revolution**). While it **is** true that the committees presented many
decisions as a **fait accompli** the rank-and-file of the CNT and FAI
did not simply follow orders nor ratify all of the decisions blindly.

In any revolutionary situation decisions have to be made quickly and
sometimes without consulting the base of the organisation. However, such
decisions must be accountable to the membership who must discuss and
ratify them (this was the policy within the CNT militias, for example).
The experience of the CNT and FAI in countless strikes, insurrections
and campaigns had proven the decentralised, federal structure was more
than capable of pursuing the class war -- revolution is no exception as
it is the class war in its most concentrated form. In other words, the
organisational principles of the CNT and FAI were more than adequate for
a revolutionary situation.

The centralising tendencies, therefore, cannot be blamed on the
exceptional circumstances of the war. Rather, it was the policy of
collaboration which explains them. Unlike the numerous strikes and
revolts that occurred before July 19th, 1936, the CNT higher committees
had started to work within the state structure. This, by its very
nature, must generate hierarchical and centralising tendencies as those
involved must adapt to the states basic structure and form. The
violations of CNT policy flowed from the initial decision to compromise
in the name of *"anti-fascist unity"* and a vicious circle developed --
each compromise pushed the CNT leadership further into the arms of the
state, which increased hierarchical tendencies, which in turn isolated
these higher committees from the membership, which in turn encouraged a
conciliatory policy by those committees.

This centralising and hierarchical tendency did not mean that the higher
committees of the CNT simply imposed their will on the rest of the
organisation. It is very clear that the decision to collaborate had,
initially, the passive support of the majority of the CNT and FAI
(probably because they thought the war would be over after a few weeks
or months). As visiting French anarchist Sebastian Faure noted, while
*"effective participation in central authority has had the approval of
the majority within the unions and in the groups affiliated to the FAI,
that decision has in many places encountered the opposition of a fairly
substantial minority. Thus there has been no unanimity."* [quoted by
Jose Peirats, **The CNT in the Spanish Revolution**, vol. 1, p. 183] In
the words of Peirats:

> *"Were all of the militants of the same mind? . . . Excepting some
> vocal minorities which expressed their protests in their press organs
> and through committees, gatherings, plenums and assemblies, the dismal
> truth is that the bulk of the membership was in thrall to a certain
> fatalism which was itself a direct consequence of the tragic realities
> of the war."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 181]

And:

> *"We have already seen how, on the economic plane, militant anarchism
> forged ahead, undaunted, with its work of transforming the economy. It
> is not to be doubted -- for to do so would have been to display
> ignorance of the psychology of the libertarian rank and file of the
> CNT -- that a muffled contest, occasionally erupting at plenums and
> assemblies and manifest in some press organs broke out as soon as the
> backsliding began. In this connection, the body of opinion hostile to
> any possible deviation in tactics and principles was able to count
> throughout upon spirited champions."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 210]

Thus, within the libertarian movement, there was a substantial minority
who opposed the policy of collaboration and made their opinions known in
various publications and meetings. While many (if not most)
revolutionary anarchists volunteered for the militias and so were not
active in their unions as before, there were various groups (such as
Catalan Libertarian Youth, the Friends of Durruti, other FAI groups, and
so on) which were opposed to collaboration and argued their case openly
in the streets, collectives, organisational meetings and so on.
Moreover, outside the libertarian movement the two tiny Trotskyist
groups also argued against collaboration, as did sections of the POUM.
Therefore it is impossible to state that the CNT membership were unaware
of the arguments against the dominant policy. Also the Catalan CNT's
higher committees, for example, after the May Days of 1937 could not get
union assemblies or plenums to expel the Friends of Durruti nor to get
them to withhold financial support for the Libertarian Youth, who
opposed collaboration vigorously in their publications, nor get them to
call upon various groups of workers to stop distributing opposition
publications in the public transit system or with the daily milk. [Abe
Bluestein, *"Translator's Note"*, Juan Gomez Casas, **Anarchist
Organisation: The History of the FAI**, p. 10]

This suggests that in spite of centralising tendencies, the higher
committees of the CNT were still subject to some degree of popular
influence and control and should not be seen as having dictatorial
powers over the organisation. While many decisions **were** presented as
**fait accompli** to the union plenums (often called by the committees
at short notice), in violation of past CNT procedures, the plenums could
not be railroaded into ratifying **any** decision the committees wanted.
The objective circumstances associated with the war against Franco and
fascism convinced most CNT members and libertarian activists that
working with other parties and unions within the state was the only
feasible option. Also to do otherwise, they thought, was to weaken the
war effort by provoking another Civil War in the anti-Franco camp. While
such a policy did not work (when it was strong enough the Republican
state did start a civil war against the CNT which gutted the struggle
against fascism) it cannot be argued that it was imposed upon the
membership nor that they did not hear opposing positions. Sadly, the
call for anti-fascist unity dominated the minds of the libertarian
movement.

In the early stages, the majority of rank-and-file militants believed
that the war would be over in a matter of weeks. After all, a few days
had been sufficient to rout the army in Barcelona and other industrial
centres. This inclined them to, firstly, tolerate (indeed, support) the
collaboration of the CNT with the *"Central Committee of Anti-Fascist
Militias"* and, secondly, to start expropriating capitalism in the
belief that the revolution would soon be back on track (the opportunity
to start introducing anarchist ideas was simply too good to waste,
regardless of the wishes of the CNT leadership). They believed that the
revolution and libertarian communism, as debated and adopted by the
CNT's Zaragoza Congress of May that year, was an inseparable aspect of
the struggle against fascism and proceeded appropriately. The ignoring
of the state, rather than its destruction, was seen as a short-term
compromise, soon to be corrected. Sadly, there were wrong --
collaboration had a logic all its own, one which got worse as the war
dragged on (and soon it was too late).

Which, we must note indicates the superficial nature of most Marxist
attacks on anarchism using the CNT as the key evidence. After all, it
was the anarchists and anarchist influenced members of the CNT who
organised the collectives, militias and started the transformation of
Spanish society. They did so inspired by anarchism and in an anarchist
way. To praise their actions, while attacking "anarchism", shows a lack
of logic. Indeed, these actions have more in common with anarchist ideas
than the actions and rationales of the CNT leadership. Thus, to attack
"anarchism" by pointing to the anti-anarchist actions of a few leaders
while ignoring the anarchist actions of the majority is flawed.

Therefore, to summarise, it is clear that while the internal structure
of the CNT was undermined and authoritarian tendencies increased by its
collaboration with the state, the CNT was not transformed into a mere
appendage to the higher committees of the organisation. The union
plenums could and did reject the calls made by the leadership of the
CNT. Support for "anti-fascist unity" was widespread among the CNT
membership (in spite of the activities and arguments of large minority
of anarchists) and was reflected in the policy of collaboration pursued
by the organisation. While the CNT higher committees were transformed
into a bureaucratic leadership, increasingly isolated from the rank and
file, it cannot be argued that their power was absolute nor totally at
odds with the wishes of the membership. Ironically, but unsurprisingly,
the divergences from the CNT's previous libertarian organisational
principles confirmed anarchist theory, becoming a drag on the revolution
and a factor in its defeat.

As we argued in [section I.8.11](secI8.html#seci811), the initial
compromise with the state, the initial betrayal of anarchist theory and
CNT policy, contained all the rest. Moreover, rather than refute
anarchism, the experience of the CNT after it had rejected anarchist
theory confirmed it -- centralised, hierarchical organisations hindered
and ultimately destroyed the revolution. The experience of the CNT and
FAI suggests that those, like Leninists, who argue for **more**
centralisation and for "democratic" hierarchical structures have refused
to understand, let alone learn from, history. The increased
centralisation within the CNT aided and empowered the leadership (a
minority) and disempowered the membership (the majority). Rather than
federalism hindering the revolution, it, as always, was centralism which
did so.

Therefore, in spite of a sizeable minority of anarchists **within** the
CNT and FAI arguing against the dominant policy of "anti-fascist unity"
and political collaboration, this policy was basically agreed to by the
CNT membership and was not imposed upon them. The membership of the CNT
could, and did, reject suggestions of the leadership and so, in spite of
the centralisation of power that occurred in the CNT due to the policy
of collaboration, it cannot be argued that this policy was alien to the
wishes of the rank-and-file however lamentable the results of that
position were.

I.8.13 What political lessons were learned from the revolution?
---------------------------------------------------------------

The most important political lesson learned from the Spanish Revolution
is that a revolution cannot compromise with existing power structures.
In this, it just confirmed anarchist theory and the basic libertarian
position that a social revolution will only succeed if it follows an
anarchist path and does not seek to compromise in the name of fighting a
"greater evil." As Kropotkin put it, a *"revolution that stops half-way
is sure to be soon defeated."* [**The Great French Revolution**, vol. 2,
p. 553]

On the 20th of July, after the fascist coup had been defeated in
Barcelona, the CNT sent a delegation of its members to meet the leader
of the Catalan Government. A plenum of CNT union shop stewards, in the
light of the fascist coup, agreed that libertarian communism would be
postpone until Franco had been defeated (the rank and file ignored them
and collectivised their workplaces). They organised a delegation to
visit the Catalan president to discuss the situation:

> *"The delegation . . . was intransigent . . . Either Companys [the
> Catalan president] must accept the creation of a Central Committee [of
> Anti-Fascist Militias] as the ruling organisation or the CNT would
> **consult the rank and file and expose the real situation to the
> workers.** Companys backed down."* [our emphasis, Abel Paz, **Durruti:
> The People Armed**, p. 216]

The CNT committee members used their new-found influence in the eyes of
Spain to unite with the leaders of other organisations/parties but not
the rank and file. This process lead to the creation of the **Central
Committee of Anti-Fascist Militias**, in which political parties as well
as labour unions were represented. This committee was not made up of
mandated delegates from workplaces, communities or barricades, but of
representatives of existing organisations, nominated by committees.
Instead of a genuine confederal body (made up of mandated delegates from
workplace, militia and neighbourhood assemblies) the CNT created a body
which was not accountable to, nor could reflect the ideas of, working
class people expressed in their assemblies. The state and government was
not abolished by self-management, only ignored. This was a mistake and
many soon came *"to realise that once they went into the so-called
united-front, they could do nothing else but go further. In other words,
the one mistake, the one wrong step inevitably led to others as it
always does. I am more than ever convinced that if the comrades had
remained firm on their own grounds they would have remained stronger
than they are now. But I repeat, once they had made common cause for the
period of the anti-Fascist war, they were driven by the logic of events
to go further."* [Emma Goldman, **Vision on Fire**, pp. 100-1]

The most obvious problem, of course, was that collaboration with the
state ensured that a federation of workers' associations could not be
created to co-ordinate the struggle against fascism and the social
revolution. As Stuart Christie argues: *"By imposing their leadership
from above, these partisan committees suffocated the mushrooming popular
autonomous revolutionary centres -- the grass-roots factory and local
revolutionary committees -- and prevented them from proving themselves
as an efficient and viable means of co-ordinating communications,
defence and provisioning. They also prevented the Local Revolutionary
committees from integrating with each other to form a regional,
provincial and national federal network which would facilitate the
revolutionary task of social and economic reconstruction."* [**We, the
Anarchists!**, pp. 99-100] Without such a federation, it was only a
matter of time before the CNT joined the bourgeois government.

Rather than being *"a regime of **dual power**"* and the *"most
important"* of the *"new organs of power"* as many Trotskyists,
following Felix Morrow, maintain, the **Central Committee of
Anti-Fascist Militias** created on July 20th, 1936, was, in fact, an
organ of class collaboration and a handicap to the revolution.
[**Revolution and Counter-Revolution in Spain**, p. 85 and p. 83] Stuart
Christie was correct to call it an *"artificial and hybrid creation,"* a
*"compromise, an artificial political solution, an officially sanctioned
appendage of the Generalidad government"* which *"drew the CNT-FAI
leadership inexorably into the State apparatus, until then its principal
enemy."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 105] Only a true federation of delegates from
the fields, factories and workplaces could have been the framework of a
true organisation of (to use Bakunin's expression) *"the social (and, by
consequence, anti-political) power of the working masses."* [**Michael
Bakunin: Selected Writings**, pp. 197-8]

Therefore, the CNT forgot a basic principle of anarchism, namely *"the
destruction . . . of the States."* Instead, like the Paris Commune, the
CNT thought that *"in order to combat . . . reaction, they had to
organise themselves in reactionary Jacobin fashion, forgetting or
sacrificing what they themselves knew were the first conditions of
revolutionary socialism."* The real basis of the revolution, the basic
principle of anarchism, was that the *"future social organisation must
be made solely from the bottom upwards, by the free association or
federation of workers, firstly in their unions, then in communes,
regions, nations and finally in a great federation, international and
universal."* [Bakunin, **Op. Cit.**, p. 198, p. 202 and p. 204] By not
doing this, by working in a top-down compromise body rather than
creating a federation of workers' councils, the CNT leadership could not
help eventually sacrificing the revolution in favour of the war.

Of course, if a full plenum of CNT unions and **barrios** defence
committees, with delegates invited from UGT and unorganised workplaces,
had taken place there is no guarantee that the decision reached would
have been in line with anarchist theory. The feelings for antifascist
unity were strong. However, the decision would have been fully discussed
by the rank and file of the union, under the influence of the
revolutionary anarchists who were later to join the militias and leave
for the front. It is likely, given the wave of collectivisation and what
happened in Aragón, that the decision would have been different and the
first step would have made to turn this plenum into the basis of a free
federation of workers associations -- i.e. the framework of a
self-managed society -- which could have smashed the state and ensured
no other appeared to take its place.

So the basic idea of anarchism, the need to create a federation of
workers councils, was ignored. In the name of "antifascist" unity, the
CNT worked with parties and classes which hated both them and the
revolution. In the words of Sam Dolgoff *"both before and after July
19th, an unwavering determination to crush the revolutionary movement
was the leitmotif behind the policies of the Republican government;
irrespective of the party in power."* [**The Anarchist Collectives**, p.
40] Without creating a means to organise the *"social power"* of the
working class, the CNT was defenceless against these parties once the
state had re-organised itself.

To justify their collaboration, the leaders of the CNT-FAI argued that
not to do so would have lead to a civil war within the civil war, so
allowing Franco easy victory. In practice, while paying lip service to
the revolution, the Communists and republicans attacked the collectives,
murdered anarchists, restricted supplies to collectivised industries
(even **war** industries) and disbanded the anarchist militias after
refusing to give them weapons and ammunition (preferring to arm the
Civil Guard in the rearguard in order to crush the CNT and the
revolution). By collaborating, a civil war was not avoided. One occurred
anyway, with the working class as its victims, as soon as the state felt
strong enough.

Garcia Oliver (the first ever, and hopefully last, "anarchist" minister
of justice) stated in 1937 that collaboration was necessary and that the
CNT had *"renounc[ed] revolutionary totalitarianism, which would lead to
the strangulation of the revolution by anarchist and Confederal [CNT]
dictatorship. We had confidence in the word and in the person of a
Catalan democrat"* Companys (who had in the past jailed anarchists).
[quoted by Vernon Richards, **Lessons of the Spanish Revolution**, p.
34] Which means that only by working with the state, politicians and
capitalists can an anarchist revolution be truly libertarian!

> 42]

The dilemma of *"anarchist dictatorship"* or *"collaboration"* raised in
1937 was fundamentally wrong. It was never a case of banning parties,
and other organisations under an anarchist system, far from it. Full
rights of free speech, organisation and so on should have existed for
all but the parties would only have as much influence as they exerted in
union, workplace, community and militia assemblies, as should be the
case! "Collaboration" yes, but within the rank and file and within
organisations organised in an anarchist manner. Anarchism does not
respect the "freedom" to be a boss or politician. In his history of the
FAI, Juan Gomaz Casas (an active FAI member in 1936) made this clear:

> *"How else could libertarian communism be brought about? It would
> always signify dissolution of the old parties dedicated to the idea of
> power, or at least make it impossible for them to pursue their
> politics aimed at seizure of power. There will always be pockets of
> opposition to new experiences and therefore resistance to joining 'the
> spontaneity of the unanimous masses.' In addition, the masses would
> have complete freedom of expression in the unions and in the economic
> organisations of the revolution as well as their political
> organisations in the district and communities."* [**Anarchist
> Organisation: the History of the FAI**, p. 188f]

Instead of this "collaboration" from the bottom up, by means of a
federation of workers' associations, community assemblies and militia
columns as argued for by anarchists from Bakunin onwards, the CNT and
FAI committees favoured "collaboration" from the top down. The leaders
ignored the state and co-operated with other trade unions officials as
well as political parties in the **Central Committee of Anti-Fascist
Militias**. In other words, they ignored their political ideas in favour
of a united front against what they considered the greater evil, namely
fascism. This inevitably lead the way to counter-revolution, the
destruction of the militias and collectives, as they was no means by
which these groups could co-ordinate their activities independently of
the state. The continued existence of the state ensured that economic
confederalism between collectives (i.e. extending the revolution under
the direction of the syndicates) could not develop naturally nor be
developed far enough in all places. Due to the political compromises of
the CNT the tendencies to co-ordination and mutual aid could not develop
freely (see [next section](secI8.html#seci814)).

It is clear that the defeat in Spain was due to a failure not of
anarchist theory and tactics but a failure of anarchists to **apply**
their theory and tactics. Instead of destroying the state, the CNT-FAI
ignored it. For a revolution to be successful it needs to create
organisations which can effectively replace the state and the market;
that is, to create a widespread libertarian organisation for social and
economic decision-making through which working class people can start to
set their own agendas. Only by going down this route can the state and
capitalism be effectively smashed.

In building the new world we must destroy the old one. Revolutions may
be, as Engels suggested, "authoritarian" by their very nature, but only
in respect to institutions, structures and social relations which
promote injustice, hierarchy and inequality. As discussed in [section
H.7.4](secH4.html#sech47), it is not "authoritarian" to destroy
authority and not tyrannical to dethrone tyrants! Revolutions, above all
else, must be libertarian in respect to the oppressed. That is, they
must develop structures that involve the great majority of the
population, who have previously been excluded from decision-making on
social and economic issues. In fact, a revolution is the most
**libertarian** thing ever.

As the **Friends of Durruti** argued a *"revolution requires the
absolute domination of the workers' organisations."* [*"The Friends of
Durruti accuse"*, **Class War on the Home Front**, Wildcat Group (ed.),
p. 34] Only this, the creation of viable anarchist social organisations,
can ensure that the state and capitalism can be destroyed and replaced
with a just system based on liberty, equality and solidarity. Just as
Bakunin, Kropotkin and a host of other anarchist thinkers had argued
decades previously (see [section H.1.4](secH1.html#sech14)). Thus the
most important lesson gained from the Spanish Revolution is simply the
correctness of anarchist theory on the need to organise the social and
economic power of the working class by a free federation of workers
associations to destroy the state. Without this, no revolution can be
lasting. As Gomez Casas correctly argued, *"if instead of condemning
that experience [of collaboration], the movement continues to look for
excuses for it, the same course will be repeated in the future . . .
exceptional circumstances will again put . . . anarchism on [its] knees
before the State."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 251]

The second important lesson is on the nature of anti-fascism. The CNT
leadership, along with many (if not most) of the rank-and-file, were
totally blinded by the question of anti-fascist unity, leading them to
support a "democratic" state against a "fascist" one. While the basis of
a new world was being created around them by the working class,
inspiring the fight against fascism, the CNT leaders collaborated with
the system that spawns fascism. While the anti-fascist feelings of the
CNT leadership were sincere, the same cannot be said of their "allies"
(who seemed happier attacking the gains of the semi-revolution than
fighting fascism). As the Friends of Durruti make clear: *"Democracy
defeated the Spanish people, not Fascism."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 30] To be
opposed to fascism is not enough, you also have to be anti-capitalist.
As Durruti stressed, *"[n]o government in the world fights fascism to
the death. When the bourgeoisie sees power slipping from its grasp, it
has recourse to fascism to maintain itself."* [quoted by Vernon
Richards, **Op. Cit.**, p. 193f] In Spain, anti-fascism destroyed the
revolution, not fascism. As the Scottish Anarchist Ethel McDonald argued
at the time: *"Fascism is not something new, some new force of evil
opposed to society, but is only the old enemy, Capitalism, under a new
and fearful sounding name . . . Anti-Fascism is the new slogan by which
the working class is being betrayed."* [**Workers Free Press**, October
1937]

Thirdly, the argument of the CNT that Libertarian Communism had to wait
until after the war was a false one. Fascism can only be defeated by
ending the system that spawned it (i.e. capitalism). In addition, in
terms of morale and inspiration, the struggle against fascism could only
be effective if it were also a struggle **for** something better --
namely a free society. To fight fascism for a capitalist democracy which
had repressed the working class would hardly inspire those at the front.
Similarly, the only hope for workers' self-management was to push the
revolution as far as possible, i.e. to introduce libertarian communism
while fighting fascism. The idea of waiting for libertarian communism
ultimately meant sacrificing it for the war effort. This would, by
necessity, mean the end of the revolutionary spirit and hope which could
inspire and sustain the war effort. Why would people fight for a return
to the status quo? A status quo that they had rebelled against before
the start of the civil war and which had provoked the fascist coup in
the first place.

Fourthly, the role of anarchists in a social revolution is to always
encourage organisation *"from below"* (to use one of Bakunin's favourite
expressions), revolutionary organisations which can effectively smash
the state. Bakunin himself argued (see [section
I.8.11](secI8.html#seci811)) in favour of workers' councils,
complemented by community assemblies (the federation of the barricades)
and a self-managed militia. This model is still applicable today and was
successfully applied in Aragón by the CNT.

Therefore, the political lessons gained from the experience of the CNT
come as no surprise. They simply repeat long standing positions within
anarchist theory. As anarchists have argued since Bakunin, no revolution
is possible unless the state is smashed, capital expropriated and a free
federation of workers' associations created as the framework of
libertarian socialism. Rather than refuting anarchism, the experience of
the Spanish Revolution confirms it.

I.8.14 What economic lessons were learned from the revolution?
--------------------------------------------------------------

The most important economic lesson from the revolution is the fact that
working class people took over the management of industry and did an
amazing job of keeping (and improving!) production in the face of the
direst circumstances (a factor often overlooked by the opponents of
anarchism and the revolution). Not only did workers create a war
industry from almost nothing in Catalonia, they also improved working
conditions and innovated with new techniques and processes. The Spanish
Revolution shows that self-management is possible and that the
constructive powers of people inspired by an ideal can transform
society.

Self-management allowed a massive increase in innovation and new ideas.
The Spanish Revolution is clear proof of the anarchist case against
hierarchy and validates Isaac Puente words that in *"a free collective
each benefits from accumulated knowledge and specialised experiences of
all, and vice versa. There is a reciprocal relationship wherein
information is in continuous circulation."* [**The Anarchist
Collectives**, p. 32] The workers, freed from economic autocracy,
started to transform their workplaces and how the produced goods.

From the point of view of individual freedom, it is clear that
self-management allowed previously marginalised people to take an active
part in the decisions that affected them. Egalitarian organisations
provided the framework for a massive increase in participation and
individual self-government, which expressed itself in the extensive
innovations carried out by the Collectives. The Collectives indicate, in
Stirner's words, that *"[o]nly in the union can you assert yourself as
unique, because the union does not possess you, but you possess it or
make it of use to you."* [**The Ego and Its Own**, p. 312] A fact Emma
Goldman confirmed from her visits to collectives and discussions with
their members:

> *"I was especially impressed with the replies to my questions as to
> what actually had the workers gained by the collectivisation . . . the
> answer always was, first, greater freedom. And only secondly, more
> wages and less time of work. In two years in Russia [1920-21] I never
> heard any workers express this idea of greater freedom."* [**Vision on
> Fire**, p. 62]

As predicted in anarchist theory, and borne out by actual experience,
there exists large untapped reserves of energy and initiative in the
ordinary person which self-management can call forth. The collectives
proved Kropotkin's argument that co-operative work is more productive
and that if the economists wish to prove *"their thesis in favour of
**private property** against all other forms of **possession**, should
not the economists demonstrate that under the form of communal property
land never produces such rich harvests as when the possession is
private. But this they could not prove; in fact, it is the contrary that
has been observed."* [**The Conquest of Bread**, p. 146]

Beyond this five important lessons can be derived from the actual
experience of a libertarian socialist economy:

Firstly, that an anarchist society cannot be created overnight, but is a
product of many different influences as well as the objective
conditions. In this the anarchist collectives confirmed the ideas of
anarchist thinkers like Bakunin and Kropotkin (see [section
I.2.2](secI2.html#seci22)). The collectives although, as mentioned in
[section I.8.3](secI8.html#seci83), based on key libertarian principles
they were a somewhat unexpected development. They reflected objective
circumstances facing the revolution as well as libertarian theory and,
with regards the latter, were somewhat limited. However, they were
organisations created from below by the revolution and so capable of
development and progress.

The lesson from every revolution is that the mistakes made in the
process of liberation by people themselves are always minor compared to
the results of a self-proclaimed vanguard creating institutions **for**
people. The Spanish Revolution is a clear example of this, with the
Catalan state's *"collectivisation decree"* causing more harm than good
(as intended, it controlled and so limited the economic transformation
of the economy). Luckily, the Spanish anarchists recognised the
importance of having the freedom to make mistakes, as can be seen by the
many different forms of collectives and federations tried. The actual
process in Spain towards industrial co-ordination and so socialisation
was dependent on the wishes of the workers involved -- as would be
expected in a true social revolution. As Bakunin argued, the
*"revolution should not only be made for the people's sake; it should
also be made by the people."* [**No Gods, No Masters**, vol. 1, p. 141]
The problems faced by a social revolution will be solved in the
interests of the working class only if working class people solve them
themselves. For this to happen it requires working class people to
manage their own affairs directly -- and this implies anarchism, not
centralisation or state control/ownership. The experience of the
collectives in Spain supports.

Secondly, the importance of decentralisation of management. As discussed
in [section I.8.4](secI8.html#seci84), different areas and industries
tried different forms of federation. The woodworkers' union experience
indicates that a collectivised industry can became centralised, with
even a democratically elected administration leading to rank-and-file
workers becoming marginalised which could soon result in apathy
developing within it. This was predicted by Kropotkin and other
anarchist theorists (and by many anarchists in Spain at the time). While
undoubtedly better than capitalist hierarchy, such democratically run
industries are only close approximations to anarchist ideas of
self-management. Importantly, however, the collectivisation experiments
also indicate that co-operation need not imply centralisation (as can be
seen from the Badelona collectives).

Thirdly, the importance of building links of solidarity between
workplaces as soon as possible. While the importance of starting
production after the fascist uprising made attempts at co-ordination
seem of secondary importance to the collectives, the competition that
initially occurred between workplaces helped the state to undermine
self-management (for example, the state *"was actively using its control
of finances to contain and stifle radical change"* [Graham Kesley,
**Anarchosyndicalism, Libertarian Communism and the State**, p. 172]).
As there was no People's Bank or federal body to co-ordinate credit and
production, state control of credit and the gold reserves made it easier
for the Republican state to undermine the revolution by controlling the
collectives and (effectively) nationalising them in time (Durruti and a
few others planned to seize the gold reserves but were advised not to by
Abad de Santillán).

This attack on the revolution started when the Catalan State issued a
decree legalising (and so controlling) the collectives in October 1936
(the infamous *"Collectivisation Decree"*). The counter-revolution also
withheld funds for collectivised industries, even war industries, until
they agreed to come under state control. The industrial organisation
created by this decree was a compromise between anarchist ideas and
those of other parties (particularly the communists) and in the words of
Gaston Leval, *"the decree had the baneful effect of preventing the
workers' syndicates from extending their gains. It set back the
revolution in industry."* [**The Anarchist Collectives**, p. 54]

And lastly, that an economic revolution can only succeed if the existing
state is destroyed. As Kropotkin argued, *"a new form of economic
organisation will necessarily require a new form of political
structure."* [**Anarchism**, p. 181] Capitalism needs the state,
socialism needs anarchy. Without the new political structure, the new
economic organisation cannot develop to its full potential. Due to the
failure to consolidate the revolution **politically**, it was lost
**economically**. The decree *"legalising"* collectivisation *"distorted
everything right from the start."* [Leval, **Collectives in the Spanish
Revolution**, p. 227] This helped undermine the revolution by ensuring
that the mutualism of the collectives did not develop freely into
libertarian communism (*"The collectives lost the economic freedom they
had won at the beginning"* due to the decree, as one participant put
it). Collectives, of course, tried to ignore the state. As an eyewitness
pointed out, the CNT's *"policy was thus not the same as that pursued by
the decree."* [quoted by Ronald Fraser, **Blood of Spain**, p. 230 and
p. 213] Indeed, leading anarchists like Abad de Santillán opposed it:

> *"I was an enemy of the decree because I considered it premature . . .
> when I became councillor, I had no intention of taking into account or
> carrying out the decree: I intended to allow our great people to carry
> on the task as they best saw fit, according to their own
> inspiration."* [quoted by Fraser, **Op. Cit.**, p. 212fn]

However, with the revolution lost politically, the CNT was soon forced
to compromise and support the decree (the CNT did propose more
libertarian forms of co-ordination between workplaces but these were
undermined by the state). A lack of effective mutual aid organisations
allowed the state to gain power over the collectives and so undermine
and destroy self-management. Working class control over the economy
(important as it is) does not automatically destroy the state. In other
words, the economic aspects of the revolution cannot be considered in
isolation from its political ones.

Yet these points do not diminish the successes of the Spanish
revolution. As Gaston Leval argued, *"in spite of these shortcomings"*
caused lack of complete socialisation *"the important fact is that the
factories went on working, the workshops and works produced without the
owners, capitalists, shareholders and without high management
executives."* [**Collectives in the Spanish Revolution**, p. 228] Beyond
doubt, these months of economic liberty in Spain show not only that
libertarian socialism **works** and that working class people can manage
and run society but also that we can improve the quality of life and
increase freedom. Given the time and breathing space, the experiment
would undoubtedly have ironed out its problems. Even in the very
difficult environment of a civil war (and with resistance of almost all
other parties and unions) the workers and peasants of Spain showed that
a better society is possible. They gave a concrete example of what was
previously just a vision, a world which was more humane, more free, more
equitable and more civilised than that run by capitalists, managers,
politicians and bureaucrats.
