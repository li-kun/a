I.1 Isn't libertarian socialism an oxymoron?
============================================

In a word, no. This question is often asked by those who have come
across the so-called "libertarian" right. As discussed in [section
A.1.3](secA1.html#seca13), the word *"libertarian"* has been used by
anarchists for far longer than the pro-free market right have been using
it. In fact, anarchists have been using it as a synonym for anarchist
for over 150 years, since 1858. In comparison, widespread use of the
term by the so-called "libertarian" right dates from the 1970s in
America (with, from the 1940s onwards, limited use by a few
individuals). Indeed, outside of North America *"libertarian"* is still
essentially used as an equivalent of *"anarchist"* and as a shortened
version of *"libertarian socialist."* As Noam Chomsky notes:

> *"Let me just say regarding the terminology, since we happen to be in
> the United States, we have to be rather careful. Libertarian in the
> United States has a meaning which is almost the opposite of what it
> has in the rest of the world traditionally. Here, libertarian means
> ultra right-wing capitalist. In the European tradition, libertarian
> meant socialist. So, anarchism was sometimes called libertarian
> socialism, a large wing of anarchism, so we have to be a little
> careful about terminology."* [**Reluctant Icon**]

This in itself does not prove that the term *"libertarian socialist"* is
free of contradiction. However, as we will show below, the claim that
the term is self-contradictory rests on the assumption that socialism
requires the state in order to exist and that socialism is incompatible
with liberty (and the equally fallacious claim that capitalism is
libertarian and does not need the state). This assumption, as is often
true of many objections to socialism, is based on a misconception of
what socialism is, a misconception that many authoritarian socialists
and the state capitalism of Soviet Russia have helped to foster. In
reality it is the term *"state socialism"* which is the true oxymoron.

Sadly many people take for granted the assertion of many on the right
and left that socialism equals Leninism or Marxism and ignore the rich
and diverse history of socialist ideas, ideas that spread from communist
and individualist-anarchism to Leninism. As Benjamin Tucker once noted,
*"the fact that State Socialism . . . has overshadowed other forms of
Socialism gives it no right to a monopoly of the Socialistic idea."*
[**Instead of a Book**, pp. 363-4] Unfortunately, many on the left
combine with the right to do exactly that. Indeed, the right (and, of
course, many on the left) consider that, by definition, "socialism"
**is** state ownership and control of the means of production, along
with centrally planned determination of the national economy (and so
social life).

Yet even a quick glance at the history of the socialist movement
indicates that the identification of socialism with state ownership and
control is not common. For example, Anarchists, many Guild Socialists,
council communists (and other libertarian Marxists), as well as
followers of Robert Owen, all rejected state ownership. Indeed,
anarchists recognised that the means of production did not change their
form as capital when the state took over their ownership nor did
wage-labour change its nature when it is the state employing labour (for
example, see [section H.3.13](secH3.html#sech313)). For anarchists state
ownership of capital is not socialistic in the slightest. Indeed, as
Tucker was well aware, state ownership turned **everyone** into a
proletarian (bar the state bureaucracy) -- hardly a desirable thing for
a political theory aiming for the end of wage slavery!

So what **does** socialism mean? Is it compatible with libertarian
ideals? What do the words *"libertarian"* and *"socialism"* actually
mean? It is temping to use dictionary definitions as a starting point,
although we should stress that such a method holds problems as different
dictionaries have different definitions and the fact that dictionaries
are rarely politically sophisticated. Use one definition, and someone
else will counter with one more to their liking. For example,
*"socialism"* is often defined as *"state ownership of wealth"* and
*"anarchy"* as *"disorder."* Neither of these definitions are useful
when discussing political ideas, particularly anarchism as, obviously,
no form of anarchism would be socialist by such a definition nor do
anarchists seek disorder. Therefore, the use of dictionaries is not the
end of a discussion and often misleading when applied to politics.

Libertarian, though, is generally defined to mean someone who upholds
the principles of liberty, especially individual liberty of thought and
action. Such a situation cannot but be encouraged by socialism, by free
access to the means of life. This is because in such a situation people
associate as equals and so. as John Most and Emma Goldman once argued,
the *"system of communism logically excludes any and every relation
between master and servant, and means really Anarchism."* [*"Talking
about Anarchy"*, p. 28, **Black Flag**, no. 228, p. 28] In other words,
by basing itself on free association and self-management in every aspect
of life the anarchist form of socialism cannot but be libertarian.

In other words, there is a reason why anarchists have used the term
libertarian for over 150 years! More to the point, why assume that the
right's recent appropriation of the word be considered the base point?
That implies that private property defends individual liberty rather
than suppresses it. Such an assumption, as anarchists have argued from
the start of anarchism as a distinct socio-political theory, is wrong.
As we discussed earlier (see [section B.4](secB4.html), for example),
capitalism denies liberty of thought and action within the workplace
(unless one is the boss, of course). As one staunch defender of
capitalism (and a classical liberal often listed as a forefather of
right-wing "libertarianism") glibly noted, the capitalist *"of course
exercises power over the workers"*, although *"he cannot exercise it
arbitrarily"* thanks to the market but within this limit *"the
entrepreneur is free to give full rein to his whims"* and *"to dismiss
workers offhand"* [Ludwig von Mises, **Socialism**, p. 443 and p. 444]
Right-wing "libertarians" are utterly blind to the liberty-destroying
hierarchies associated with private property, perhaps unsurprisingly as
they are fundamentally pro-capitalist and anti-socialist (equally
unsurprisingly, genuine libertarians tend to call them "propertarians").
As left-wing economist Geoffrey M. Hodgson correctly notes:

> *"By their own logic, [such] market individualists are forced to
> disregard the organisational structure of the firm, or to falsely
> imagine that markets exist inside it. To do otherwise would be to
> admit that a system as dynamic as capitalism depends upon a mode of

> market individualists to ignore the reality of non-market
> organisations in the private sector . . . They can thus ignore the
> reality of control and authority within the private capitalist
> corporation but remain critical of public sector bureaucracy and state
> planning."* [**Economics and Utopia**, pp. 85-6]

The propertarian perspective inevitably generates massive
contradictions, such as admitting that both the state and private
property share a common monopoly of decision making over a given area
yet opposing only the former (see [section F.1](secF1.html)). As
anarchists have long pointed out, the hierarchical social relations
associated with private property have nothing to do with individual
liberty. Removing the state but keeping private property would,
therefore, not be a step forward: *"A fine business we would make if we
destroyed the State and replaced it with a mass of little States!
killing a monster with one head and keeping a monster with a thousand
heads!"* [Carlo Cafiero, *"Anarchy and Communism"*, pp. 179-86, **The
Raven**, No. 6, p. 181]

This is why we argue that anarchism is more than just a stateless
society, for while a society without a state is a necessary condition
for anarchy it is not sufficient -- private hierarchies also limit
freedom. Hence Chomsky:

> *"It's all generally based on the idea that hierarchic and
> authoritarian structures are not self-justifying. They have to have a
> justification . . . For example, your workplace is one point of
> contact and association. So, workplaces ought to be democratically
> controlled by participants . . . there are all kinds of ways in which
> people interact with one another. The forms of organisation and
> association that grow out of those should be, to the extent possible,
> non-authoritarian, non-hierarchic, managed and directed by the
> participants."* [**Reluctant Icon**]

Therefore, anarchists argue, **real** libertarian ideas **must** be
based on workers self-management, i.e. workers must control and manage
the work they do, determining where and how they do it and what happens
to the fruit of their labour, which in turn means the elimination of
wage labour. Or, to use Proudhon's words, the *"abolition of the
proletariat."* [**Selected Writings of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon**, p. 179]
Unless this is done then the majority of people will become subject to
the authoritarian social relationships the likes of Mises and other
right-wing "libertarians" support. As one communist-anarchist put it:

> *"It is because the individual does not own himself, and is not
> permitted to be his true self. He has become a mere market commodity,
> an instrument for the accumulation of property -- for others . . .
> Individuality is stretched on the Procrustes bed of business . . . If
> our individuality were to be made the price of breathing, what ado
> there would be about the violence done to the personality! And yet our
> very right to food, drink and shelter is only too often conditioned
> upon our loss of individuality. These things are granted to the
> propertyless millions (and how scantily!) only in exchange for their
> individuality -- they become the mere instruments of industry."* [Max
> Baginski, *"Stirner: The Ego and His Own"*, pp. 142-151, **Mother
> Earth**, Vol. II, No. 3, p. 150]

Socialism, anarchists argue, can only mean a classless and
anti-authoritarian (i.e. libertarian) society in which people manage
their own affairs, either as individuals or as part of a group
(depending on the situation). In other words, it implies self-management
in all aspects of life -- including work. It has always struck
anarchists as somewhat strange and paradoxical (to say the least) that a
system of *"natural"* liberty (Adam Smith's term, misappropriated by
supporters of capitalism) involves the vast majority having to sell that
liberty in order to survive. Thus to be consistently libertarian is,
logically, to advocate self-management, and so socialism (see [section
G.4.2](secG4.html#secg42)). This explains the long standing anarchist
opposition to the phoney "individualism" associated with classical
liberalism (so-called right-wing "libertarian" ideology, although better
termed "propertarian" to avoid confusion). Thus we find Emma Goldman
dismissing *"this kind of individualism"* in *"whose name . . . social
oppression are defended and held up as virtues."* [**Red Emma Speaks**,
p. 112]

As we will discuss in [section I.3.3](secI3.html#seci33), socialisation
is advocated to ensure the elimination of wage labour and is a common
theme of all genuine forms of socialism. In theory at least, anarchist
argue that state socialism does not eliminate wage labour, rather it
universalises it. In fact, state socialism shows that socialism is
**necessarily** libertarian, not statist. For if the state owns the
workplace, then the producers do not, and so they will not be at liberty
to manage their own work but will instead be subject to the state as the
boss. Moreover, replacing the capitalist owning class by state officials
in no way eliminates wage labour; in fact it makes it worse in many
cases. Therefore "socialists" who argue for nationalisation of the means
of production are **not** socialists (which means that the Soviet Union
and the other so-called "socialist" countries are **not** socialist nor
are parties which advocate nationalisation socialist).

Indeed, attempts to associate socialism with the state misunderstands
the nature of socialism. It is an essential principle of socialism that
(social) inequalities between individuals must be abolished to ensure
liberty for all (**natural** inequalities cannot be abolished, nor do
anarchists desire to do so). Socialism, as Proudhon put it, *"is
egalitarian above all else."* [**No Gods, No Masters**, vol. 1, p. 57]
This applies to inequalities of power as well, especially to
**political** power. And any hierarchical system (particularly the
state) is marked by inequalities of power -- those at the top (elected
or not) have more power than those at the bottom. Hence the following
comments provoked by the expulsion of anarchists from the social
democratic Second International:

> *"It could be argued with much more reason that we are the most
> logical and most complete socialists, since we demand for every person
> not just his [or her] entire measure of the wealth of society but also
> his [or her] portion of social power, which is to say, the real
> ability to make his [or her] influence felt, along with that of
> everybody else, in the administration of public affairs."* [Malatesta
> and Hamon, **Op. Cit.**, vol. 2, p. 20]

The election of someone to administer public affairs **for you** is not
having a portion of social power. It is, to use of words of Emile Pouget
(a leading French anarcho-syndicalist) *"an act of abdication,"* the
delegating of power into the hands of a few. [**Op. Cit.**, p. 67] This
means that *"**[a]ll political power inevitably creates a privileged
situation** for the men who exercise it. Thus it violates, from the
beginning, the equalitarian principle."* [Voline, **The Unknown
Revolution**, p. 249]

From this short discussion we see the links between libertarian and
socialism. To be a true libertarian requires you to support workers'
control otherwise you support authoritarian social relationships. To
support workers' control, by necessity, means that you must ensure that
the producers own (and so control) the means of producing and
distributing the goods they create. Without ownership, they cannot truly
control their own activity or the product of their labour. The situation
where workers possess the means of producing and distributing goods is
socialism. Thus to be a true libertarian requires you to be a socialist.

Similarly, a true socialist must also support individual liberty of
thought and action, otherwise the producers "possess" the means of
production and distribution in name only. If the state owns the means of
life, then the producers do not and so are in no position to manage
their own activity. As the experience of Russia under Lenin shows, state
ownership soon produces state control and the creation of a bureaucratic
class which exploits and oppresses the workers even more so than their
old bosses. Since it is an essential principle of socialism that
inequalities between people must be abolished in order to ensure
liberty, it makes no sense for a genuine socialist to support any
institution based on inequalities of power (and as we discussed in
[section B.2](secB2.html), the state is just such an institution). To
oppose inequality and not extend that opposition to inequalities in
power, especially **political** power, suggests a lack of clear
thinking. Thus to be a true socialist requires you to be a libertarian,
to be for individual liberty and opposed to inequalities of power which
restrict that liberty.

Therefore, rather than being an oxymoron, *"libertarian socialism"*
indicates that true socialism must be libertarian and that a libertarian
who is not a socialist is a phoney. As true socialists oppose wage
labour, they must also oppose the state for the same reasons. Similarly,
consistent libertarians must oppose wage labour for the same reasons
they must oppose the state. So, libertarian socialism rejects the idea
of state ownership and control of the economy, along with the state as
such. Through workers' self-management it proposes to bring an end to
authority, exploitation, and hierarchy in production. This in itself
will increase, not reduce, liberty. Those who argue otherwise rarely
claim that political democracy results in less freedom than political
dictatorship.

One last point. It could be argued that many social anarchists smuggle
the state back in via communal ownership of the means of life. This,
however, is not the case. To argue so confuses society with the state.
The communal ownership advocated by collectivist and communist
anarchists is not the same as state ownership. This is because it is
based on horizontal relationships between the actual workers and the
"owners" of social capital (i.e. the federated communities as a whole,
which includes the workers themselves we must stress), not vertical ones
as in nationalisation (which are between state bureaucracies and its
"citizens"). Also, such communal ownership is based upon letting workers
manage their own work and workplaces. This means that it is based upon,
and does not replace, workers' self-management. In addition, all the
members of an anarchist community fall into one of three categories:

Therefore, workers' self-management within a framework of communal
ownership is entirely compatible with libertarian and socialist ideas
concerning the possession of the means of producing and distributing
goods by the producers themselves. Far from there being any
contradiction between libertarianism and socialism, libertarian ideals
imply socialist ones, and vice versa. As Bakunin put it in 1867:

> *"We are convinced that freedom without Socialism is privilege and
> injustice, and that Socialism without freedom is slavery and
> brutality."* [**Bakunin on Anarchism**, p. 127]

History has proven him correct. Rather that libertarian socialism being
the oxymoron, it is state socialism and libertarian capitalism that are.
Both historically (in terms of who first used the word) and logically
(in terms of opposing all hierarchical organisations) it is anarchists
who should be called libertarians, **not** the propertarian right.

I.1.1 Is socialism impossible?
------------------------------

In 1920, the right-wing economist Ludwig von Mises declared socialism to
be impossible. A leading member of the "Austrian" school of economics,
he argued this on the grounds that without private ownership of the
means of production, there cannot be a competitive market for production
goods and without a market for production goods, it is impossible to
determine their values. Without knowing their values, economic
rationality is impossible and so a socialist economy would simply be
chaos: *"the absurd output of a senseless apparatus."* For Mises,
socialism meant central planning with the economy *"subject to the
control of a supreme authority."* [*"Economic Calculation in the
Socialist Commonwealth"*, pp. 87-130, **Collectivist Economic
Planning**, F.A von Hayek (ed.), p. 104 and p. 106] While applying his
*"economic calculation argument"* to Marxist ideas of a future socialist
society, his argument, it is claimed, is applicable to **all** schools
of socialist thought, including libertarian ones. It is on the basis of
his arguments that many right-wingers claim that libertarian (or any
other kind of) socialism is impossible in principle.

Yet as David Schweickart observes *"[i]t has long been recognised that
Mises's argument is logically defective. Even without a market in
production goods, their monetary values can be determined."* [**Against
Capitalism**, p. 88] In other words, economic calculation based on
prices is perfectly possible in a libertarian socialist system. After
all, to build a workplace requires so many tonnes of steel, so many
bricks, so many hours of work and so on. If we assume a mutualist
society, then the prices of these goods can be easily found as the
co-operatives in question would be offer their services on the market.
These commodities would be the inputs for the construction of production
goods and so the latter's monetary values can be found.

Ironically enough, Mises **did** mention the idea of such a mutualist
system in his initial essay. *"Exchange relations between
production-goods can only be established on the basis of private
ownership of the means of production"* he asserted. *"When the 'coal
syndicate' provides the 'iron syndicate' with coal, no price can be
formed, except when both syndicates are the owners of the means of
production employed in their business. This would not be socialisation
but workers' capitalism and syndicalism."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 112]
However, his argument is flawed for numerous reasons.

First, and most obvious, socialisation (as we discuss in [section
I.3.3](secI3.html#seci33)) simply means free access to the means of
life. As long as those who join a workplace have the same rights and
liberties as existing members then there is socialisation. A market
system of co-operatives, in other words, is **not** capitalist as there
is no wage labour involved as a new workers become full members of the
syndicate, with the same rights and freedoms as existing members. Thus
there are no hierarchical relationships between owners and wage slaves
(even if these owners also happen to work there). As all workers'
control the means of production they use, it is not capitalism.

Second, nor is such a system usually called, as Mises suggests,
*"syndicalism"* but rather mutualism and he obviously considered its
most famous advocate, Proudhon and his *"fantastic dreams"* of a mutual
bank, as a socialist. [**Op. Cit.**, p. 88] Significantly, Mises
subsequently admitted that it was *"misleading"* to call syndicalism
workers' capitalism, although *"the workers are the owners of the means
of production"* it was *"not genuine socialism, that is, centralised
socialism"*, as it *"must withdraw productive goods from the market.
Individual citizens must not dispose of the shares in the means of
production which are allotted to them."* Syndicalism, i.e., having those
who do the work control of it, was *"the ideal of plundering hordes"*!
[**Socialism**, p. 274fn, p. 270, p. 273 and p. 275]

His followers, likewise, concluded that "syndicalism" was not capitalism
with Hayek stating that there were *"many types of socialism"* including
*"communism, syndicalism, guild socialism"*. Significantly, he indicated
that Mises argument was aimed at systems based on the *"central
direction of all economic activity"* and so *"earlier systems of more
decentralised socialism, like guild-socialism or syndicalism, need not
concern us here since it seems now to be fairly generally admitted that
they provide no mechanism whatever for a rational direction of economic
activity."* [*"The Nature and History of the Problem"*, pp. 1-40,
**Collectivist Economic Planning**, F.A von Hayek (ed.),p. 17, p. 36 and
p. 19] Sadly he failed to indicate who *"generally admitted"* such a
conclusion. More recently, Murray Rothbard urged the state to impose
private shares onto the workers in the former Stalinist regimes of
Eastern Europe as ownership was *"not to be granted to collectives or
co-operatives or workers or peasants holistically, which would only
bring back the ills of socialism in a decentralised and chaotic
syndicalist form."* [**The Logic of Action II**, p. 210]

Third, syndicalism usually refers to a strategy (revolutionary unionism)
used to achieve (libertarian) socialism rather than the goal itself (as
Mises himself noted in a tirade against unions, *"Syndicalism is nothing
else but the French word for trade unionism"* [**Socialism**, p. 480]).
It could be argued that such a mutualist system could be an aim for some
syndicalists, although most were and still are in favour of libertarian
communism (a simple fact apparently unknown to Mises). Indeed, Mises
ignorance of syndicalist thought is striking, asserting that the
*"market is a consumers' democracy. The syndicalists want to transform
it into a producers' democracy."* [**Human Action**, p. 809] Most
syndicalists, however, aim to **abolish** the market and **all** aim for
workers' control of production to **complement** (not replace) consumer
choice. Syndicalists, like other anarchists, do not aim for workers'
control of consumption as Mises asserts. Given that Mises asserts that
the market, in which one person can have a thousand votes and another
one, is a *"democracy"* his ignorance of syndicalist ideas is perhaps
only one aspect of a general ignorance of reality.

More importantly, the whole premise of his critique of mutualism is
flawed. *"Exchange relations in productive goods"* he asserted, *"can
only be established on the basis of private property in the means of
production. If the Coal Syndicate delivers coal to the Iron Syndicate a
price can be fixed only if both syndicates own the means of production
in industry."* [**Socialism**, p. 132] This may come as a surprise to
the many companies whose different workplaces sell each other their
products! In other words, capitalism itself shows that workplaces owned
by the same body (in this case, a large company) can exchange goods via
the market. That Mises makes such a statement indicates well the firm
basis of his argument in reality. Thus a socialist society can have
extensive autonomy for its co-operatives, just as a large capitalist
firm can:

> *"the entrepreneur is in a position to separate the calculation of
> each part of his total enterprise in such a way that he can determine
> the role it plays within his whole enterprise. Thus he can look at
> each section as if it were a separate entity and can appraise it
> according to the share it contributes to the success of the total
> enterprise. Within this system of business calculation each section of
> a firm represents an integral entity, a hypothetical independent
> business, as it were. It is assumed that this section 'owns' a
> definite part of the whole capital employed in the enterprise, that it
> buys from other sections and sells to them, that it has its own
> expenses and its own revenues, that its dealings result either in a
> profit or in a loss which is imputed to its own conduct of affairs as

> accounts show a profit, and it is to his disadvantage if they show a
> loss. His own interests impel him toward the utmost care and exertion
> in the conduct of his section's affairs."* [**Human Action**, pp.
> 301-2]

So much, then, for the notion that common ownership makes it impossible
for market socialism to work. After all, the libertarian community can
just as easily separate the calculation of each part of its enterprise
in such a way as to determine the role each co-operative plays in its
economy. It can look at each section as if it were a separate entity and
appraise it according to the share it contributes as it is assumed that
each section "owns" (i.e., has use rights over) its definite part. It
can then buy from, and sell to, other co-operatives and a profit or loss
can be imputed to evaluate the independent action of each co-operative
and so their own interests impel the co-operative workers toward the
utmost care and exertion in the conduct of their co-operative's affairs.

So to refute Mises, we need only repeat what he himself argued about
large corporations! Thus there can be extensive autonomy for workplaces
under socialism and this does not in any way contradict the fact that
*"all the means of production are the property of the community."*
[*"Economic Calculation in the Socialist Commonwealth"*, **Op. Cit.**,
p. 89] Socialisation, in other words, does **not** imply central
planning but rather free access and free association. In summary, then,
Mises confused property rights with use rights, possession with
property, and failed to see now a mutualist system of socialised
co-operatives exchanging products can be a viable alternative to the
current exploitative and oppressive economic regime.

Such a mutualist economy also strikes at the heart of Mises' claims that
socialism was *"impossible."* Given that he accepted that there may be
markets, and hence market prices, for consumer goods in a socialist
economy his claims of the impossibility of socialism seems unfounded.
For Mises, the problem for socialism was that *"because no
production-good will ever become the object of exchange, it will be
impossible to determine its monetary value."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 92] The
flaw in his argument is clear. Taking, for example, coal, we find that
it is both a means of production and of consumption. If a market in
consumer goods is possible for a socialist system, then competitive
prices for production goods is also possible as syndicates producing
production-goods would also sell the product of their labour to other
syndicates or communes. As Mises admitted when discussing one scheme of
guild socialism, *"associations and sub-associations maintain a mutual
exchange-relationship; they receive and give as if they were owners.
Thus a market and market-prices are formed."* Thus, when deciding upon a
new workplace, railway or house, the designers in question do have
access to competitive prices with which to make their decisions. Nor
does Mises' argument work against communal ownership in such a system as
the commune would be buying products from syndicates in the same way as
one part of a company can buy products from another part of the same
company under capitalism. That goods produced by self-managed syndicates
have market-prices does not imply capitalism for, as they abolish wage
labour and are based on free-access (socialisation), it is a form of
socialism (as socialists define it, Mises' protestations that *"this is
incompatible with socialism"* not-with-standing!). [**Socialism**, p.
518]

Murray Rothbard suggested that a self-managed system would fail, and a
system *"composed exclusively of self-managed enterprises is impossible,
and would lead . . . to calculative chaos and complete breakdown."* When
*"each firm is owned jointly by all factor-owners"* then *"there is no
separation at all between workers, landowners, capitalists, and
entrepreneurs. There would be no way, then, of separating the wage
incomes received from the interest or rent incomes or profits received.
And now we finally arrive at the real reason why the economy cannot
consist completely of such firms (called 'producers' co-operatives').
For, without an external market for wage rates, rents, and interest,
there would be no rational way for entrepreneurs to allocate factors in
accordance with the wishes of the consumers. No one would know where he
could allocate his land or his labour to provide the maximum monetary
gains. No entrepreneur would know how to arrange factors in their most
value-productive combination to earn greatest profit. There could be no
efficiency in production because the requisite knowledge would be
lacking."* [quoted by David L. Prychitko, **Markets, Planning and
Democracy**, p. 135 and p. 136]

It is hard to take this argument seriously. Consider, for example, a
pre-capitalist society of farmers and artisans. Both groups of people
own their own means of production (the land and the tools they use). The
farmers grow crops for the artisans who, in turn, provide the farmers
with the tools they use. According to Rothbard, the farmers would have
no idea what to grow nor would the artisans know which tools to buy to
meet the demand of the farmers nor which to use to reduce their working
time. Presumably, both the farmers and artisans would stay awake at
night worrying what to produce, wishing they had a landlord and boss to
tell them how best to use their labour and resources.

Let us add the landlord class to this society. Now the landlord can tell
the farmer what to grow as their rent income indicates how to allocate
the land to its most productive use. Except, of course, it is still the
farmers who decide what to produce. Knowing that they will need to pay
rent (for access to the land) they will decide to devote their (rented)
land to the most profitable use in order to both pay the rent and have
enough to live on. Why they do not seek the most profitable use without
the need for rent is not explored by Rothbard. Much the same can be said
of artisans subject to a boss, for the worker can evaluate whether an
investment in a specific new tool will result in more income or reduced
time labouring or whether a new product will likely meet the needs of
consumers. Moving from a pre-capitalist society to a post-capitalist
one, it is clear that a system of self-managed co-operatives can make
the same decisions without requiring economic masters. This is
unsurprising, given that Mises' asserted that the boss *"of course
exercises power over the workers"* but that the *"lord of production is
the consumer."* [**Socialism**, p. 443] In which case, the boss need not
be an intermediary between the real "lord" and those who do the
production!

All in all, Rothbard confirms Kropotkin's comments that economics
(*"that pseudo-science of the bourgeoisie"*) *"does not cease to give
praise in every way to the benefits of individual property"* yet *"the
economists do not conclude, 'The land to him who cultivates it.' On the
contrary, they hasten to deduce from the situation, 'The land to the
lord who will get it cultivated by wage earners!'"* [**Words of a
Rebel**, pp. 209-10] In addition, Rothbard implicitly places
"efficiency" above liberty, preferring dubious "efficiency" gains to the
actual gains in freedom which the abolition of workplace autocracy would
create. Given a choice between liberty and "efficiency", the genuine
anarchist would prefer liberty. Luckily, though, workplace liberty
increases efficiency so Rothbard's decision is a wrong one. It should
also be noted that Rothbard's position (as is usually the case) is
directly opposite that of Proudhon, who considered it *"inevitable"*
that in a free society *"the two functions of **wage-labourer** on the
one hand, and of **proprietor-capitalist-contractor** on the other,
become equal and inseparable in the person of every workingman"*. This
was the *"first principle of the new economy, a principle full of hope
and of consolation for the labourer without capital, but a principle
full of terror for the parasite and for the tools of parasitism, who see
reduced to naught their celebrated formula: **Capital, labour,
talent**!"* [**Proudhon's Solution of the Social Problem**, p. 165 and
p. 85]

And it does seem a strange co-incidence that someone born into a
capitalist economy, ideologically supporting it with a passion and
seeking to justify its class system just happens to deduce from a given
set of axioms that landlords and capitalists happen to play a vital role
in the economy! It would not take too much time to determine if someone
in a society without landlords or capitalists would also logically
deduce from the same axioms the pressing economic necessity for such
classes. Nor would it take long to ponder why Greek philosophers, like
Aristotle, concluded that slavery was natural. And it does seem strange
that centuries of coercion, authority, statism, classes and hierarchies
all had absolutely no impact on how society evolved, as the end product
of real history (the capitalist economy) just happens to be the same as
Rothbard's deductions from a few assumptions predict. Little wonder,
then, that "Austrian" economics seems more like rationalisations for
some ideologically desired result than a serious economic analysis.

Even some dissident "Austrian" economists recognise the weakness of
Rothbard's position. Thus *"Rothbard clearly misunderstands the general
principle behind producer co-operatives and self-management in
general."* In reality, *"[a]s a democratic method of enterprise
organisation, workers' self-management is, in principle, fully
compatible with a market system"* and so *"a market economy comprised of
self-managed enterprises is consistent with Austrian School theory . . .
It is fundamentally a **market-based system** . . . that doesn't seem to
face the epistemological hurdles . . . that prohibit rational economic
calculation"* under state socialism. Sadly, socialism is still equated
with central planning, for such a system *"is certainly not socialism.
Nor, however, is it capitalism in the conventional sense of the term."*
In fact, it is not capitalism at all and if we assume that free access
to resources such as workplaces and credit, then it most definitely
**is** socialism (*"Legal ownership is not the chief issue in defining
workers' self-management -- management is. Worker-managers, though not
necessarily the legal owners of all the factors of production collected
within the firm, are free to experiment and establish enterprise policy
as they see fit."*). [David L. Prychitko, **Op. Cit.**, p. 136, p. 135,
pp. 4-5, p. 4 and p. 135] This suggests that non-labour factors can be
purchased from other co-operatives, credit provided by mutual banks
(credit co-operatives) at cost and so forth. As such, a mutualist system
is perfectly feasible.

Thus economic calculation based on competitive market prices is possible
under a socialist system. Indeed, we see examples of this even under
capitalism. For example, the Mondragon co-operative complex in the
Basque Country indicate that a libertarian socialist economy can exist
and flourish. Perhaps it will be suggested that an economy needs stock
markets to price companies, as Mises did. Thus investment is *"not a
matter for the mangers of joint stock companies, it is essentially a
matter of the capitalists"* in the *"stock exchanges"*. Investment, he
asserted, was *"not a matter of wages"* of managers but of *"the
capitalist who buys and sell stocks and shares, who make loans and
recover them, who make deposits in the banks."* [**Socialism**, p. 139]

It would be churlish to note that the members of co-operatives under
capitalism, like most working class people, are more than able to make
deposits in banks and arrange loans. In a mutualist economy, workers
will not loose this ability just because the banks are themselves
co-operatives. Similarly, it would be equally churlish but essential to
note that the stock market is hardly the means by which capital is
actually raised within capitalism. As David Engler points out,
*"[s]upporters of the system . . . claim that stock exchanges mobilise
funds for business. Do they? When people buy and sell shares, 'no
investment goes into company treasuries . . . Shares simply change hands
for cash in endless repetition.' Company treasuries get funds only from
new equity issues. These accounted for an average of a mere 0.5 per cent
of shares trading in the US during the 1980s."* [**Apostles of Greed**,
pp. 157-158] This is echoed by David Ellerman:

> *"In spite of the stock market's large symbolic value, it is notorious
> that it has relatively little to do with the production of goods and
> services in the economy (the gambling industry aside). The
> overwhelming bulk of stock transactions are in second-hand shares so
> that the capital paid for shares usually goes to other stock traders,
> not to productive enterprises issuing new shares."* [**The Democratic
> Worker-Owned Firm**, p. 199]

This suggests that the *"efficient allocation of capital in production
does not require a stock market (witness the small business sector
[under capitalism])."* *"Socialist firms,"* he notes, *"are routinely
attacked as being inherently inefficient because they have no equity
shares exposed to market valuation. If this argument had any merit, it
would imply that the whole sector of unquoted closely-held small and
medium-sized firms in the West was 'inherently inefficient' -- a
conclusion that must be viewed with some scepticism. Indeed, in the
comparison to large corporations with publicly-traded shares, the
closely-held firms are probably **more** efficient users of capital."*
[**Op. Cit.**, p. 200 and p. 199]

In terms of the impact of the stock market on the economy there is good
reason to think that this **hinders** economic efficiency by generating
a perverse set of incentives and misleading information flows and so
their abolition would actually **aid** production and productive
efficiency).

Taking the first issue, the existence of a stock market has serious
(negative) effects on investment. As Doug Henwood notes, there *"are
serious communication problems between managers and shareholders."* This
is because *"[e]ven if participants are aware of an upward bias to
earnings estimates [of companies], and even if they correct for it,
managers would still have an incentive to try to fool the market. If you
tell the truth, your accurate estimate will be marked down by a
sceptical market. So, it's entirely rational for managers to boost
profits in the short term, either through accounting gimmickry or by
making only investments with quick paybacks."* So, managers *"facing a
market [the stock market] that is famous for its preference for quick
profits today rather than patient long-term growth have little choice
but to do its bidding. Otherwise, their stock will be marked down, and
the firm ripe for take-over."* While *"[f]irms and economies can't get
richer by starving themselves"* stock market investors *"can get richer
when the companies they own go hungry -- at least in the short term. As
for the long term, well, that's someone else's problem the week after
next."* [**Wall Street**, p. 171]

Ironically, this situation has a parallel with Stalinist central
planning. Under that system the managers of State workplaces had an
incentive to lie about their capacity to the planning bureaucracy. The
planner would, in turn, assume higher capacity, so harming honest
managers and encouraging them to lie. This, of course, had a seriously
bad impact on the economy. Unsurprisingly, the similar effects caused by
capital markets on economies subject to them are as bad as well as
downplaying long term issues and investment. In addition, it should be
noted that stock-markets regularly experiences bubbles and subsequent
bursts. Stock markets may reflect the collective judgements of
investors, but it says little about the quality of those judgements.
What use are stock prices if they simply reflect herd mentality, the
delusions of people ignorant of the real economy or who fail to see a
bubble? Particularly when the real-world impact when such bubbles burst
can be devastating to those uninvolved with the stock market?

In summary, then, firms are *"over-whelmingly self-financing -- that is,
most of their investment expenditures are funded through profits (about
90%, on longer-term averages)"* The stock markets provide *"only a
sliver of investment funds."* There are, of course, some *"periods like
the 1990s, during which the stock market serves as a conduit for
shovelling huge amounts of cash into speculative venues, most of which
have evaporated . . . Much, maybe most, of what was financed in the
1990s didn't deserve the money."* Such booms do not last forever and are
*"no advertisement for the efficiency of our capital markets."*
[Henwood, **After the New Economy**, p. 187 and p. 188]

Thus there is substantial reason to question the suggestion that a stock
market is necessary for the efficient allocation of capital. There is no
need for capital markets in a system based on mutual banks and networks
of co-operatives. As Henwood concludes, *"the signals emitted by the
stock market are either irrelevant or harmful to real economic activity,
and that the stock market itself counts little or nothing as a source of
finance. Shareholders . . . have no useful role."* [**Wall Street**, p.
292]

Then there is also the ironic nature of Rothbard's assertion that
self-management would ensure there *"could be no efficiency in
production because the requisite knowledge would be lacking."* This is
because capitalist firms are hierarchies, based on top-down central
planning, and this hinders the free flow of knowledge and information.
As with Stalinism, within the capitalist firm information passes up the
organisational hierarchy and becomes increasingly simplified and
important local knowledge and details lost (when not deliberately
falsified to ensure continual employment by suppressing bad news). The
top-management takes decisions based on highly aggregated data, the
quality of which is hard to know. The management, then, suffers from
information and knowledge deficiencies while the workers below lack
sufficient autonomy to act to correct inefficiencies as well as
incentive to communicate accurate information and act to improve the
production process. As Cornelius Castoriadis correctly noted:

> *"Bureaucratic planning is nothing but the extension to the economy as

> Writings**, vol. 2, pp. 62-3]

This is *"the same objection as that Hayek raises against the
possibility of a planned economy. Indeed, the epistemological problems
that Hayek raised against centralised planned economies have been echoed
within the socialist tradition as a problem within the capitalist
firm."* There is *"a real conflict within the firm that parallels that
which Hayek makes about any centralised economy."* [John O'Neill, **The
Market**, p. 142] This is because workers have knowledge about their
work and workplace that their bosses lack and a self-managed
co-operative workplace would motivate workers to use such information to
improve the firm's performance. In a capitalist workplace, as in a
Stalinist economy, the workers have no incentive to communicate this
information as *"improvements in the organisation and methods of
production initiated by workers essentially profit capital, which often
then seizes hold of them and turns them against the workers. The workers
know it and consequently they restrict their participation in production
. . . They restrict their output; they keep their ideas to themselves .
. . They organise among themselves to carry out their work, all the
while keeping up a facade of respect for the official way they are
supposed to organise their work."* [Castoriadis, **Op. Cit.**, pp.
181-2] An obvious example would be concerns that management would seek
to monopolise the workers' knowledge in order to accumulate more
profits, better control the workforce or replace them (using the higher
productivity as an excuse). Thus self-management rather than hierarchy
enhances the flow and use of information in complex organisations and so
improves efficiency.

This conclusion, it should be stressed, is not idle speculation and that
Mises was utterly wrong in his assertions related to self-management.
People, he stated, *"err"* in thinking that profit-sharing *"would spur
the worker on to a more zealous fulfilment of his duties"* (indeed, it
*"must lead straight to Syndicalism"*) and it was *"nonsensical to give
'labour' . . . a share in management. The realisation of such a
postulate would result in syndicalism."* [**Socialism**, p. 268, p. 269
and p. 305] Yet, as we note in [section I.3.2](secI3.html#seci32), the
empirical evidence is overwhelmingly against Mises (which suggests why
"Austrians" are so dismissive of empirical evidence, as it exposes flaws
in the great chains of deductive reasoning they so love). In fact,
workers' participation in management and profit sharing enhance
productivity. In one sense, though, Mises is right, in that capitalist
firms will tend not to encourage participation or even profit sharing as
it shows to workers the awkward fact that while the bosses may need
them, they do not need the bosses. As discussed in [section
J.5.12](secJ5.html#secj512), bosses are fearful that such schemes
**will** lead to "syndicalism" and so quickly stop them in order to
remain in power -- in spite (or, more accurately, because) of the
efficiency and productivity gains they result in.

*"Both capitalism and state socialism,"* summarises Ellerman, *"suffer
from the motivational inefficiency of the employment relation."* **Op.
Cit.**, pp. 210-1] Mutualism would be **more** efficient as well as
freer for, once the stock market and workplace hierarchies are removed,
serious blocks and distortions to information flow will be eliminated.

Unfortunately, the state socialists who replied to Mises in the 1920s
and 1930s did not have such a libertarian economy in mind. In response
to Mises initial challenge, a number of economists pointed out that
Pareto's disciple, Enrico Barone, had already, 13 years earlier,
demonstrated the theoretical possibility of a *"market-simulated
socialism."* However, the principal attack on Mises's argument came from
Fred Taylor and Oscar Lange (for a collection of their main papers, see
**On the Economic Theory of Socialism**). In light of their work, Hayek
shifted the question from theoretical impossibility to whether the
theoretical solution could be approximated in practice. Which raises an
interesting question, for if (state) socialism is *"impossible"* (as
Mises assured us) then what **did** collapse in Eastern Europe? If the
"Austrians" claim it **was** "socialism" then they are in the somewhat
awkward position that something they assure us is *"impossible"* existed
for decades. Moreover, it should be noted that both sides of the
argument accepted the idea of central planning of some kind or another.
This means that most of the arguments of Mises and Hayek did not apply
to libertarian socialism, which rejects central planning along with
every other form of centralisation.

Nor was the response by Taylor and Lange particularly convincing in the
first place. This was because it was based far more on neo-classical
capitalist economic theory than on an appreciation of reality. In place
of the Walrasian *"Auctioneer"* (the "god in the machine" of general
equilibrium theory which ensures that all markets clear) Taylor and
Lange presented the *"Central Planning Board"* whose job it was to
adjust prices so that all markets cleared. Neo-classical economists who
are inclined to accept Walrasian theory as an adequate account of a
working capitalist economy will be forced to accept the validity of
their model of "socialism." Little wonder Taylor and Lange were
considered, at the time, the victors in the "socialist calculation"
debate by most of the economics profession (with the collapse of the
Soviet Union, this decision has been revised somewhat -- although we
must point out that Taylor and Lange's model was not the same as the
Soviet system, a fact conveniently ignored by commentators).

Unfortunately, given that Walrasian theory has little bearing to
reality, we must also come to the conclusion that the Taylor-Lange
"solution" has about the same relevance (even ignoring its
non-libertarian aspects, such as its basis in state-ownership, its
centralisation, its lack of workers' self-management and so on). Many
people consider Taylor and Lange as fore-runners of *"market
socialism."* This is incorrect -- rather than being market socialists,
they are in fact "neo-classical" socialists, building a "socialist"
system which mimics capitalist economic **theory** rather than its
**reality**. Replacing Walrus's mythical creation of the *"Auctioneer"*
with a planning board does not really get to the heart of the problem!
Nor does their vision of "socialism" have much appeal -- a re-production
of capitalism with a planning board and a more equal distribution of
money income. Anarchists reject such "socialism" as little more than a
nicer version of capitalism, if that.

With the collapse of the Soviet Union, it has been fashionable to assert
that *"Mises was right"* and that socialism is impossible (of course,
**during** the cold war such claims were ignored as the Soviet threat
had to boosted and used as a means of social control and to justify
state aid to capitalist industry). Nothing could be further from the
truth as these countries were not socialist at all and did not even
approximate the (libertarian) socialist idea (the only true form of
socialism). The Stalinist countries had authoritarian *"command
economies"* with bureaucratic central planning, and so their failure
cannot be taken as proof that a decentralised, libertarian socialism
cannot work. Nor can Mises' and Hayek's arguments against Taylor and
Lange be used against a libertarian mutualist or collectivist system as
such a system is decentralised and dynamic (unlike the "neo-classical"
socialist model). Libertarian socialism of this kind did, in fact, work
remarkably well during the Spanish Revolution in the face of amazing
difficulties, with increased productivity and output in many workplaces
as well as increased equality and liberty (see [section
I.8](secI8.html)).

Thus the *"calculation argument"* does not prove that socialism is
impossible. Mises was wrong in asserting that *"a socialist system with
a market and market prices is as self-contradictory as is the notion of
a triangular square."* [**Human Action**, p. 706] This is because
capitalism is not defined by markets as such but rather by wage labour,
a situation where working class people do not have free access to the
means of production and so have to sell their labour (and so liberty) to
those who do. If quoting Engels is not **too** out of place, the
*"object of production -- to produce commodities -- **does not import**
to the instrument the character of capital"* as the *"production of
commodities is one of the preconditions for the existence of capital . .
. as long as the producer sells only **what he himself** produces, he is
not a capitalist; he becomes so only from the moment he makes use of his
instrument **to exploit the wage labour of others**."* [**Collected
Works**, Vol. 47, pp. 179-80] In this, as noted in [section
C.2.1](secC2.html#secc21), Engels was merely echoing Marx (who, in turn,
was simply repeating Proudhon's distinction between property and
possession). As mutualism eliminates wage labour by self-management and
free access to the means of production, its use of markets and prices
(both of which pre-date capitalism) does not mean it is not socialist
(and as we note in [section G.1.1](secG1.html#secg11) Marx, Engels,
Bakunin and Kropotkin, like Mises, acknowledged Proudhon as being a
socialist). This focus on the market, as David Schweickart suggests, is
no accident:

> *"The identification of capitalism with the market is a pernicious
> error of both conservative defenders of **laissez-faire** [capitalism]
> and most left opponents . . . If one looks at the works of the major
> apologists for capitalism . . . one finds the focus of the apology
> always on the virtues of the market and on the vices of central
> planning. Rhetorically this is an effective strategy, for it is much
> easier to defend the market than to defend the other two defining
> institutions of capitalism. Proponents of capitalism know well that it
> is better to keep attention toward the market and away from wage
> labour or private ownership of the means of production."* [*"Market
> Socialism: A Defense"*, pp. 7-22, **Market Socialism: the debate among
> socialists**, Bertell Ollman (ed.), p. 11]

The theoretical work of such socialists as David Schweickart (see his
books **Against Capitalism** and **After Capitalism**) present an
extensive discussion of a dynamic, decentralised market socialist system
which has obvious similarities with mutualism -- a link which some
Leninists recognise and stress in order to discredit market socialism
via guilt-by-association (Proudhon *"the anarchist and inveterate foe of
Karl Marx . . . put forward a conception of society, which is probably
the first detailed exposition of a 'socialist market.'"* [Hillel
Ticktin, *"The Problem is Market Socialism"*, pp. 55-80, **Op. Cit.**,
p. 56]). So far, most models of market socialism have not been fully
libertarian, but instead involve the idea of workers' control within a
framework of state ownership of capital (Engler in **Apostles of Greed**
is an exception to this, supporting community ownership). Ironically,
while these Leninists reject the idea of market socialism as
contradictory and, basically, not socialist they usually acknowledge
that the transition to Marxist-communism under their workers' state
would utilise the market.

So, as anarchist Robert Graham points out, *"Market socialism is but one
of the ideas defended by Proudhon which is both timely and controversial
. . . Proudhon's market socialism is indissolubly linked with his
notions of industrial democracy and workers' self-management."*
[*"Introduction"*, P-J Proudhon, **General Idea of the Revolution**, p.
xxxii] As we discuss in [section I.3.5](secI3.html#seci35) Proudhon's
system of agro-industrial federations can be seen as a non-statist way
of protecting self-management, liberty and equality in the face of
market forces (Proudhon, unlike individualist anarchists, was well aware
of the negative aspects of markets and the way market forces can disrupt
society). Dissident economist Geoffrey M. Hodgson is right to suggest
that Proudhon's system, in which *"each co-operative association would
be able to enter into contractual relations with others"*, could be
*"described as an early form of 'market socialism'"*. In fact, *"instead
of Lange-type models, the term 'market socialism' is more appropriately
to such systems. Market socialism, in this more appropriate and
meaningful sense, involves producer co-operatives that are owned by the
workers within them. Such co-operatives sell their products on markets,
with genuine exchanges of property rights"* (somewhat annoyingly,
Hodgson incorrectly asserts that *"Proudhon described himself as an
anarchist, not a socialist"* when, in reality, the French anarchist
repeatedly referred to himself and his mutualist system as socialist).
[**Economics and Utopia**, p. 20, p. 37 and p. 20]

Thus it is possible for a socialist economy to allocate resources using
markets. By suppressing capital markets and workplace hierarchies, a
mutualist system will improve upon capitalism by removing an important
source of perverse incentives which hinder efficient use of resources as
well as long term investment and social responsibility in addition to
reducing inequalities and increasing freedom. As David Ellerman once
noted, many *"still look at the world in bipolar terms: capitalism or
(state) socialism."* Yet there *"are two broad traditions of socialism:
**state socialism** and **self-management socialism**. State socialism
is based on government ownership of major industry, while
self-management socialism envisions firms being worker self-managed and
not owned or managed by the government."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 147]
Mutualism is a version of the second vision and anarchists reject the
cosy agreement between mainstream Marxists and their ideological
opponents on the propertarian right that only state socialism is "real"
socialism.

Finally, it should be noted that most anarchists are not mutualists but
rather aim for (libertarian) communism, the abolition of money. Many do
see a mutualist-like system as an inevitable stage in a social
revolution, the transitional form imposed by the objective conditions
facing a transformation of a society marked by thousands of years of
oppression and exploitation (collectivist-anarchism contains elements of
both mutualism and communism, with most of its supporters seeing it as a
transitional system). This is discussed in [section
I.2.2](secI2.html#seci22), while [section I.1.3](secI1.html#seci13)
indicates why most anarchists reject even non-capitalist markets. So
does Mises's argument mean that a socialism that abolishes the market
(such as libertarian communism) is impossible? Given that the vast
majority of anarchists seek a libertarian communist society, this is an
important question. We address it in the [next
section](secI1.html#seci12).

I.1.2 Is libertarian communism impossible?
------------------------------------------

In a word, no. While the *"calculation argument"* (see [last
section](secI1.html#seci11)) is often used by propertarians (so-called
right-wing "libertarians") as **the** basis for the argument that
communism (a moneyless society) is impossible, it is based on certain
false ideas of what prices do, the nature of the market and how a
communist-anarchist society would function. This is hardly surprising,
as Mises based his theory on a variation of neo-classical economics and
the Marxist social-democratic (and so Leninist) ideas of what a
"socialist" economy would look like. So there has been little discussion
of what a true (i.e. libertarian) communist society would be like, one
that utterly transformed the existing conditions of production by
workers' self-management and the abolition of both wage-labour **and**
money. However, it is useful here to indicate exactly why communism
would work and why the *"calculation argument"* is flawed as an
objection to it.

Mises argued that without money there was no way a socialist economy
would make "rational" production decisions. Not even Mises denied that a
moneyless society could estimate what is likely to be needed over a
given period of time (as expressed as physical quantities of definite
types and sorts of objects). As he argued, *"calculation **in natura**
in an economy without exchange can embrace consumption-goods only."* His
argument was that the next step, working out which productive methods to
employ, would not be possible, or at least would not be able to be done
"rationally," i.e. avoiding waste and inefficiency. The evaluation of
producer goods *"can only be done with some kind of economic
calculation. The human mind cannot orient itself properly among the
bewildering mass of intermediate products and potentialities without
such aid. It would simply stand perplexed before the problems of
management and location."* Thus we would quickly see *"the spectacle of
a socialist economic order floundering in the ocean of possible and
conceivable economic combinations without the compass of economic
calculation."* [*"Economic Calculation in the Socialist Commonwealth"*,
pp. 87-130, **Collectivist Economic Planning**, F.A. von Hayek (ed.), p.
104, p. 103 and p. 110] Hence the claim that monetary calculation based
on market prices is the only solution.

This argument is not without its force. How can a producer be expected
to know if tin is a better use of resources than iron when creating a
product if all they know is that iron and tin are available and suitable
for their purpose? Or, if we have a consumer good which can be made with
A + 2B or 2A + B (where A and B are both input factors such as steel,
oil electricity, etc.) how can we tell which method is more efficient
(i.e. which one used least resources and so left the most over for other
uses)? With market prices, Mises' argued, it is simple. If A cost \$10
and B \$5, then clearly method one would be the most efficient (\$20
versus \$25). Without the market, Mises argued, such a decision would be
impossible and so every decision would be *"groping in the dark."*
[**Op. Cit.**, p. 110]

Mises' argument rests on three flawed assumptions, two against communism
and one for capitalism. The first two negative assumptions are that
communism entails central planning and that it is impossible to make
investment decisions without money values. We discuss why each is wrong
in this section. Mises' positive assumption for capitalism, namely that
markets allow exact and efficient allocation of resources, is discussed
in [section I.1.5](secI1.html#seci15).

Firstly, Mises assumes a centralised planned economy. As Hayek
summarised, the crux of the matter was *"the impossibility of a rational
calculation in a centrally directed economy from which prices are
necessarily absent"*, one which *"involves planning on a most extensive
scale -- minute direction of practically all productive activity by one
central authority"*. Thus the *"one central authority has to solve the
economic problem of distributing a limited amount of resources between a
practically infinite number of competing purposes"* with *"a reasonable
degree of accuracy, with a degree of success equally or approaching the
results of competitive capitalism"* is what *"constitutes the problem of
socialism as a method."* [*"The Nature and History of the Problem"*, pp.
1-40, **Op. Cit.**, p. 35, p. 19 and pp. 16-7]

While this was a common idea in Marxian social democracy (and the
Leninism that came from it), centralised organisations are rejected by
anarchism. As Bakunin argued, *"where are the intellects powerful enough
to embrace the infinite multiplicity and diversity of real interests,
aspirations, wishes, and needs which sum up the collective will of the
people? And to invent a social organisation that will not be a
Procrustean bed upon which the violence of the State will more or less
overtly force unhappy society to stretch out?"* Moreover, a socialist
government, *"unless it were endowed with omniscience, omnipresence, and
the omnipotence which the theologians attribute to God, could not
possibly know and foresee the needs of its people, or satisfy with an
even justice those interests which are most legitimate and pressing."*
[**Bakunin on Anarchism**, pp. 268-9 and p. 318] For Malatesta, such a
system would require *"immense centralisation"* and would either be *"an
impossible thing to achieve, or, if possible, would end up as a colossal
and very complex tyranny."* [**At the Café**, p. 65]

Kropotkin, likewise, dismissed the notion of central planning as the
*"economic changes that will result from the social revolution will be
so immense and so profound . . . that it will be impossible for one or
even a number of individuals to elaborate the social forms to which a
further society must give birth. The elaboration of new social forms can
only be the collective work of the masses."* [**Words of a Rebel**, p.
175] The notion that a *"strongly centralised Government"* could
*"**command** that a prescribed quantity"* of a good *"be sent to such a
place on such a day"* and be *"received on a given day by a specified
official and stored in particular warehouses"* was not only
*"undesirable"* but also *"wildly Utopian."* During his discussion of
the benefits of free agreement against state tutelage, Kropotkin noted
that only the former allowed the utilisation of *"the co-operation, the
enthusiasm, the local knowledge"* of the people. [**The Conquest of
Bread**, pp. 82-3 and p. 137]

Kropotkin's own experience had shown how the *"high functionaries"* of
the Tsarist bureaucracy *"were simply charming in their innocent
ignorance"* of the areas they were meant to be administrating and how,
thanks to Marxism, the socialist ideal had *"lost the character of
something that had to be worked out by the labour organisations
themselves, and became state management of industries -- in fact, state
socialism; that is, state capitalism."* As an anarchist, he knew that
governments become *"isolated from the masses"* and so *"the very
success of socialism"* required *"the ideas of no-government, of
self-reliance, of free initiative of the individual"* to be *"preached
side by side with those of socialised ownership and production."* Thus
it was essential that socialism was decentralised, federal and
participatory, that the *"structure of the society which we longed for"*
was *"worked out, in theory and practice, from beneath"* in by *"all
labour unions"* with *"a full knowledge of local needs of each trade and
each locality."* [**Memoirs of a Revolutionist**, p. 184, p. 360, p.
374-5 and p. 376]

So anarchists can agree with Mises that central planning cannot work in
practice as its advocates hope. Or, more correctly, Mises agreed with
the anarchists, as we had opposed central planning first. We have long
recognised that no small body of people can be expected to know what
happens in society and plan accordingly (*"No single brain nor any
bureau of brains can see to this organisation."* [Issac Puente,
**Libertarian Communism**, p. 29]). Moreover, there is the pressing
question of freedom as well, for *"the despotism of [the 'socialist']
State would be equal to the despotism of the present state, increased by
the economic despotism of all the capital which would pass into the
hands of the State, and the whole would be multiplied by all the
centralisation necessary for this new State. And it is for this reason
that we, the Anarchists, friends of liberty, we intend to fight them to
the end."* [Carlo Cafiero, *"Anarchy and Communism"*, pp. 179-86, **The
Raven**, No. 6, p. 179]

As John O'Neill summarises, the *"argument against centralised planning
is one that has been articulated within the history of socialist
planning as an argument for democratic and decentralised decision
making."* [**The Market**, p. 132] So, for good economic and political
reasons, anarchists reject central planning. This central libertarian
socialist position feeds directly into refuting Mises' argument, for
while a **centralised** system would need to compare a large
(*"infinite"*) number of possible alternatives to a large number of
possible needs, this is not the case in a **decentralised** system.
Rather than a vast multitude of alternatives which would swamp a
centralised planning agency, one workplace comparing different
alternatives to meet a specific need faces a much lower number of
possibilities as the objective technical requirements (use-values) of a
project are known and so local knowledge will eliminate most of the
options available to a small number which can be directly compared.

As such, removing the assumption of a central planning body
automatically drains Mises' critique of much of its force -- rather than
an *"the ocean of possible and conceivable economic combinations"* faced
by a central body, a specific workplace or community has a more limited
number of possible solutions for a limited number of requirements.
Moreover, any complex machine is a product of less complex goods,
meaning that the workplace is a consumer of other workplace's goods. If,
as Mises admitted, a customer can decide between consumption goods
without the need for money then the user and producer of a *"higher
order"* good can decide between consumption goods required to meet their
needs.

In terms of decision making, it is true that a centralised planning
agency would be swamped by the multiple options available to it.
However, in a decentralised socialist system individual workplaces and
communes would be deciding between a much smaller number of
alternatives. Moreover, unlike a centralised system, the individual firm
or commune knows exactly what is required to meet its needs, and so the
number of possible alternatives is reduced as well (for example, certain
materials are simply technically unsuitable for certain tasks).

Mises' other assumption is equally flawed. This is that without the
market, no information is passed between producers beyond the final
outcome of production. In other words, he assumed that the final product
is all that counts in evaluating its use. Needless to say, it is true
that without more information than the name of a given product it is
impossible to determine whether using it would be an efficient
utilisation of resources. Yet more information can be provided which can
be used to inform decision making. As socialists Adam Buick and John
Crump point out, *"at the level of the individual production unit or
industry, the only calculations that would be necessary in socialism
would be calculations in kind. On the one side would be recorded the
resources (materials, energy, equipment, labour) used up in production
and on the other the amount of good produced, together with any
by-products. . . . Socialist production is simply the production of use
values from use values, and nothing more."* [**State Capitalism: The
Wages System Under New Management**, p. 137] Thus any good used as an
input into a production process would require the communication of this
kind of information.

The generation and communication of such information implies a
decentralised, horizontal network between producers and consumers. This
is because what counts as a use-value can only be determined by those
directly using it. Thus the production of use-values from use-values
cannot be achieved via central planning, as the central planners have no
notion of the use-value of the goods being used or produced. Such
knowledge lies in many hands, dispersed throughout society, and so
socialist production implies decentralisation. Capitalist ideologues
claim that the market allows the utilisation of such dispersed
knowledge, but as John O'Neill notes, *"the market may be one way in
which dispersed knowledge can be put to good effect. It is not . . . the
only way"*. *"The strength of the epistemological argument for the
market depends in part on the implausibility of assuming that all
knowledge could be centralised upon some particular planning agency"* he
stresses, but Mises' *"argument ignores, however, the existence of the
decentralised but predominantly non-market institutions for the
distribution of knowledge . . . The assumption that only the market can
co-ordinate dispersed non-vocalisable knowledge is false."* [**Op.
Cit.**, p. 118 and p. 132]

So, in order to determine if a specific good is useful to a person, that
person needs to know its "cost." Under capitalism, the notion of cost
has been so associated with **price** that we have to put the word
"cost" in quotation marks. However, the real cost of, say, writing a
book, is not a sum of money but so much paper, so much energy, so much
ink, so much human labour. In order to make a rational decision on
whether a given good is better for meeting a given need than another,
the would-be consumer requires this information. However, under
capitalism this information is **hidden** by the price.

Somewhat ironically, given how "Austrian" economics tends to stress that
the informational limitations are at the root of its *"impossibility"*
of socialism, the fact is that the market hides a significant amount of
essential information required to make a sensible investment decision.
This can be seen from an analysis of Mises' discussion on why
labour-time cannot replace money as a decision-making tool. Using
labour, he argued, *"leaves the employment of material factors of
production out of account"* and presents an example of two goods, P and
Q, which take 10 hours to produce. P takes 8 hours of labour, plus 2
units of raw material A (which is produced by an hour's socially
necessary labour). Q takes 9 hours of labour and one unit of A. He
asserts that in terms of labour P and Q *"are equivalent, but in value
terms P is more valuable than Q. The former is false, and only the later
corresponds to the nature and purpose of calculation."* [*"Economic
Calculation in the Socialist Commonwealth"*, **Op. Cit.**, p. 113]

The flaw in his argument is clear. Assuming that an hour of socially
necessary labour is £10 then, in price terms, P would have £80 of direct
labour costs, with £20 of raw material A while Q would have £90 of
direct labour and £10 of A. Both cost £100 so it hard to see how this
*"corresponds to the nature and purpose of calculation"*! Using less of
raw material A is a judgement made **in addition** to *"calculation"* in
this example. The question of whether to economise on the use of A
simply cannot be made using prices. If P, for example, can only be
produced via a more ecologically destructive process than Q or if the
work process by which P is created is marked by dull, mindless work but
Q's is more satisfying for the people involved than Q may be considered
a better decision. Sadly, that kind of information is **not**
communicated by the price mechanism.

As John O'Neill points out, *"Mises' earlier arguments against socialist
planning turned on an assumption about commensurability. His central
argument was that rational economic decision-making required a single
measure on the basis of which the worth of alternative states of affairs
could be calculated and compared."* [**Ecology, Policy and Politics**,
p. 115] This central assumption was unchallenged by Taylor and Lange in
their defence of "socialism", meaning that from the start the debate
against Mises was defensive and based on the argument that socialist
planning could mimic the market and produce results which were efficient
from a capitalist point of view.

Anarchists question whether using prices means basing all decision
making on one criterion and ignoring all others is a rational thing to
do. As O'Neill suggests, *"the relative scarcity of items . . . hardly
exhaust the full gamut of information that is distributed throughout
society which might be relevant to the co-ordination of economic
activities and plans."* [**The Market**, p. 196] Saying that a good
costs £10 does not tell you much about the amount of pollution its
production or use generates, under what conditions of labour it was
produced, whether its price is affected by the market power of the firm
producing it, whether it is produced in an ecologically sustainable way,
and so forth. Similarly, saying that another, similar, good costs £9
does not tell you whether than £1 difference is due to a more efficient
use of inputs or whether it is caused by imposing pollution onto the
planet.

And do prices **actually** reflect costs? The question of profit, the
reward for owning capital and allowing others to use it, is hardly a
cost in the same way as labour, resources and so on (attempts to explain
profits as an equivalent sacrifice as labour have always been ridiculous
and quickly dropped). When looking at prices to evaluate efficient use
for goods, you cannot actually tell by the price if this is so. Two
goods may have the same price, but profit levels (perhaps under the
influence of market power) may be such that one has a higher cost price
than another. The price mechanism fails to indicate which uses least
resources as it is influenced by market power. Indeed, as Takis
Fotopoulos notes, *"[i]f . . . both central planning and the market
economy inevitably lead to concentrations of power, then neither the
former nor the latter can produce the sort of information flows and
incentives which are necessary for the best functioning of any economic
system."* [**Towards an Inclusive Democracy**, p. 252] Moreover, a good
produced under a authoritarian state which represses its workforce could
have a lower price than one produced in a country which allowed unions
to organise and has basic human rights. The repression would force down
the cost of labour, so making the good in question appear as a more
"efficient" use of resources. In other words, the market can mask
inhumanity as "efficiency" and actually reward that behaviour by market
share.

In other words, market prices can be horribly distorted in that they
ignore quality issues. Exchanges therefore occur in light of false
information and, moreover, with anti-social motivations -- to maximise
short-term surplus for the capitalists regardless of losses to others.
Thus they distort valuations and impose a crass, narrow and ultimately
self-defeating individualism. Prices are shaped by more than costs,
with, for example, market power increasing market prices far higher than
actual costs. Market prices also fail to take into account public goods
and so bias allocation choices against them not to mention ignoring the
effects on the wider society, i.e. beyond the direct buyers and sellers.
Similarly, in order to make rational decisions relating to using a good,
you need to know **why** the price has changed for if a change is
permanent or transient implies different responses. Thus the current
price is not enough in itself. Has the good become more expensive
temporarily, due, say, to a strike? Or is it because the supply of the
resource has been exhausted? Actions that are sensible in the former
situation will be wrong in the other. As O'Neill suggests, *"the
information [in the market] is passed back without dialogue. The market
informs by 'exit' -- some products find a market, others do not. 'Voice'
is not exercised. This failure of dialogue . . . represents an
informational failure of the market, not a virtue . . . The market . . .
does distribute information . . . it also blocks a great deal."* [**Op.
Cit.**, p. 99]

So a purely market-based system leaves out information on which to base
rational resource allocations (or, at the very least, hides it). The
reason for this is that a market system measures, at best, preferences
of **individual** buyers among the **available** options. This assumes
that all the pertinent use-values that are to be outcomes of production
are things that are to be consumed by the individual, rather than
use-values that are collectively enjoyed (like clean air). Prices in the
market do not measure social costs or externalities, meaning that such
costs are not reflected in the price and so you cannot have a rational
price system. Similarly, if the market measures only preferences amongst
things that can be monopolised and sold to individuals, as distinguished
from values that are enjoyed collectively, then it follows that
information necessary for rational decision-making in production is not
provided by the market. In other words, capitalist "calculation" fails
because private firms are oblivious to the social cost of their labour
and raw materials inputs.

Indeed, prices often **mis**-value goods as companies can gain a
competitive advantage by passing costs onto society (in the form of
pollution, for example, or de-skilling workers, increasing job
insecurity, and so on). This externalisation of costs is actually
rewarded in the market as consumers seek the lowest prices, unaware of
the reasons **why** it is lower (such information cannot be gathered
from looking at the price). Even if we assume that such activity is
penalised by fines later, the damage is still done and cannot be undone.
Indeed, the company may be able to weather the fines due to the profits
it originally made by externalising costs (see [section
E.3](secE3.html)). Thus the market creates a perverse incentive to
subsidise their input costs through off-the-book social and
environmental externalities. As Chomsky suggests:

> *"it is by now widely realised that the economist's 'externalities can
> no longer be consigned to footnotes. No one who gives a moment's
> thought to the problems of contemporary society can fail to be aware
> of the social costs of consumption and production, the progressive
> destruction of the environment, the utter irrationality of the

> based on profit or growth-maximisation to deal with needs that can
> only be expressed collectively, and the enormous bias this system
> imposes towards maximisation of commodities for personal use in place
> of the general improvement of the quality of life."* [**Radical
> Priorities**, pp. 190-1]

Prices hide the actual costs that production involved for the
individual, society, and the environment, and instead boils everything
down into **one** factor, namely price. There is a lack of dialogue and
information between producer and consumer.

Moreover, without using another means of cost accounting instead of
prices how can supporters of capitalism know there is a correlation
between actual and price costs? One can determine whether such a
correlation exists by measuring one against the other. If this cannot be
done, then the claim that prices measure costs is a tautology (in that a
price represents a cost and we know that it is a cost because it has a
price). If it can be done, then we can calculate costs in some other
sense than in market prices and so the argument that only market prices
represent costs falls. Equally, there may be costs (in terms of quality
of life issues) which **cannot** be reflected in price terms.

Simply put, the market fails to distribute all relevant information and,
particularly when prices are at disequilibrium, can communicate
distinctly **misleading** information. In the words of two South African
anarchists, *"prices in capitalism provided at best incomplete and
partial information that obscured the workings of capitalism, and would
generate and reproduce economic and social inequalities. Ignoring the
social character of the economy with their methodological individualism,
economic liberals also ignored the social costs of particular choices
and the question of externalities."* [Michael Schmidt and Lucien van der
Walt, **Black Flame**, p. 92] This suggests that prices cannot be taken
to reflect real costs any more that they can reflect the social
expression of the valuation of goods. They are the result of a conflict
waged over these goods and those that acted as their inputs (including,
of course, labour). Market and social power, much more than need or
resource usage, decides the issue. The inequality in the means of
purchasers, in the market power of firms and in the bargaining position
of labour and capital all play their part, so distorting any
relationship a price may have to its costs in terms of resource use.
Prices are misshapen.

Little wonder Kropotkin asked whether *"are we not yet bound to analyse
that compound result we call price rather than to accept it as a supreme
and blind ruler of our actions?"* [**Fields, Factories and Workshops
Tomorrow**, p. 71] It is precisely these **real** costs, hidden by
price, which need to be communicated to producers and consumers for them
to make informed and rational decisions concerning their economic
activity.

It is useful to remember that Mises argued that it is the **complexity**
of a modern economy that ensures money is required: *"Within the narrow
confines of household economy, for instance, where the father can
supervise the entire economic management, it is possible to determine
the significance of changes in the processes of production, without such
aids to the mind [as monetary calculation], and yet with more or less of
accuracy."* However, *"the mind of one man alone -- be it ever so
cunning, is too weak to grasp the importance of any single one among the
countlessly many goods of higher order. No single man can ever master
all the possibilities of production, innumerable as they are, as to be
in a position to make straightway evident judgements of value without
the aid of some system of computation."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 102]

A libertarian communist society would, it must be stressed, use various
*"aids to the mind"* to help individuals and groups to make economic
decisions. This would reduce the complexity of economic decision making,
by allowing different options and resources to be compared to each
other. Hence the complexity of economic decision making in an economy
with a multitude of goods can be reduced by the use of rational
algorithmic procedures and methods to aid the process. Such tools would
aid decision making, not dominate it as these decisions affect humans
and the planet and should never be made automatically.

That being the case, a libertarian communist society would quickly
develop the means of comparing the real impact of specific *"higher
order"* goods in terms of their real costs (i.e. the amount of labour,
energy and raw materials used plus any social and ecological costs).
Moreover, it should be remembered that production goods are made up on
inputs of other goods, that is, higher goods are made up of consumption
goods of a lower order. If, as Mises admits, calculation without money
is possible for consumption goods then the creation of *"higher order"*
goods can be also achieved and a record of its costs made and
communicated to those who seek to use it.

While the specific *"aids to the mind"* as well as "costs" and their
relative weight would be determined by the people of a free society, we
can speculate that it would include direct and indirect labour,
externalities (such as pollution), energy use and materials, and so
forth. As such, it must be stressed that a libertarian communist society
would seek to communicate the "costs" associated with any specific
product as well as its relative scarcity. In other words, it needs a
means of determining the objective or absolute costs associated with
different alternatives as well as an indication of how much of a given
good is available at a given it (i.e., its scarcity). Both of these can
be determined without the use of money and markets.

[Section I.4](secI4.html) discusses possible frameworks for an anarchist
economy, including suggestions for libertarian communist economic
decision-making processes. In terms of *"aids to the mind"*, these
include methods to compare goods for resource allocation by indicating
the absolute costs involved in producing a good and the relative
scarcity of a specific good, among other things. Such a framework is
necessary because *"an appeal to a necessary role for practical
judgements in decision making is **not** to deny any role to general
principles. Neither . . . does it deny any place for the use of
technical rules and algorithmic procedures . . . Moreover, there is a
necessary role for rules of thumb, standard procedures, the default
procedures and institutional arrangements that can be followed
unreflectively and which **reduce** the scope for **explicit**
judgements comparing different states of affairs. There are limits in
time, efficient use of resources and the dispersal of knowledge which
require rules and institutions. Such rules and institutions can free us
for space and time for reflective judgements where they matter most."*
[John O'Neill, **Ecology, Policy and Politics**, pp. 117-8] It is these
*"rules and institutions need themselves to be open to critical and
reflective appraisal."* [O'Neill, **The Market**, p. 118]

Economic decisions, in other words, cannot be reduced down to one factor
yet Mises argued that anyone *"who wished to make calculations in regard
to a complicated process of production will immediately notice whether
he has worked more economically than others or not; if he finds, from
reference to the exchange values obtaining in the market, that he will
not be able to produce profitably, this shows that others understand how
to make better use of the higher-order goods in question."* [**Op.
Cit.**, pp. 97-8] However, this only shows whether someone has worked
more **profitably** than others, not whether it is more economical.
Market power automatically muddles this issue, as does the possibility
of reducing the monetary cost of production by recklessly exploiting
natural resources and labour, polluting, or otherwise passing costs onto
others. Similarly, the issue of wealth inequality is important, for if
the production of luxury goods proves more profitable than basic
essentials for the poor does this show that producing the former is a
better use of resources? And, of course, the key issue of the relative
strength of market power between workers and capitalists plays a key
role in determining "profitably."

Basing your economic decision making on a single criteria, namely
profitability, can, and does, lead to perverse results. Most obviously,
the tendency for capitalists to save money by not introducing safety
equipment (*"To save a dollar the capitalist build their railroads
poorly, and along comes a train, and loads of people are killed. What
are their lives to him, if by their sacrifice he has saved money?"*
[Emma Goldman, **A Documentary History of the American Years**, vol. 1,
p. 157]). Similarly, it is considered a more "efficient" use of
resources to condemn workers to deskilling and degrading work than
"waste" resources in developing machines to eliminate or reduce it
(*"How many machines remain unused solely because they do not return an
immediate profit to the capitalist! . . . How many discoveries, how many
applications of science remain a dead letter solely because they don't
bring the capitalist enough!"* [Carlo Cafiero, *"Anarchy and
Communism"*, pp. 179-86, **The Raven**, No. 6, p. 182]). Similarly,
those investments which have a higher initial cost but which, in the
long run, would have, say, a smaller environmental impact would not be
selected in a profit-driven system.

This has seriously irrational effects, because the managers of
capitalist enterprises are obliged to choose technical means of
production which produce the cheapest results. All other considerations
are subordinate, in particular the health and welfare of the producers
and the effects on the environment. The harmful effects resulting from
"rational" capitalist production methods have long been pointed out. For
example, speed-ups, pain, stress, accidents, boredom, overwork, long
hours and so on all harm the physical and mental health of those
involved, while pollution, the destruction of the environment, and the
exhaustion of non-renewable resources all have serious effects on both
the planet and those who live on it. As green economist E. F. Schumacher
argued:

> *"But what does it **mean** when we say that something is uneconomic?
> . . . [S]omething is uneconomic when it fails to earn an adequate
> profit in terms of money. The method of economics does not, and
> cannot, produce any other meaning . . . The judgement of economics . .
> . is an extremely **fragmentary** judgement; out of the large number
> of aspects which in real life have to be seen and judged together
> before a decision can be taken, economics supplies only one -- whether
> a money profit accrues **to those who undertake it** or not."*
> [**Small is Beautiful**, pp. 27-8]

Schumacher stressed that *"about the **fragmentary** nature of the
judgements of economics there can be no doubt whatever. Even with the
narrow compass of the economic calculus, these judgements are
necessarily and **methodically** narrow. For one thing, they give vastly
more weight to the short than to the long term. . . [S]econd, they are
based on a definition of cost which excludes all 'free goods' . . .
[such as the] environment, except for those parts that have been
privately appropriated. This means that an activity can be economic
although it plays hell with the environment, and that a competing
activity, if at some cost it protects and conserves the environment,
will be uneconomic."* Moreover, *"[d]o not overlook the words 'to those
who undertake it.' It is a great error to assume, for instance, that the
methodology of economics is normally applied to determine whether an
activity carried out by a group within society yields a profit to
society as a whole."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 29]

To claim that prices include all these "externalities" is nonsense. If
they did, we would not see capital moving to third-world countries with
few or no anti-pollution or labour laws. At best, the "cost" of
pollution would only be included in a price if the company was sued
successfully in court for damages -- in other words, once the damage is
done. Ultimately, companies have a strong interest in buying inputs with
the lowest prices, regardless of **how** they are produced. In fact, the
market rewards such behaviour as a company which was socially
responsible would be penalised by higher costs, and so market prices. It
is reductionist accounting and its accompanying *"ethics of
mathematics"* that produces the *"irrationality of rationality"* which
plagues capitalism's exclusive reliance on prices (i.e. profits) to
measure "efficiency."

Ironically enough, Mises also pointed to the irrational nature of the
price mechanism. He stated (correctly) that there are *"extra-economic"*
elements which *"monetary calculation cannot embrace"* because of *"its
very nature."* He acknowledged that these *"considerations themselves
can scarcely be termed irrational"* and, as examples, listed *"[i]n any
place where men regard as significant the beauty of a neighbourhood or a
building, the health, happiness and contentment of mankind, the honour
of individuals or nations."* He also noted that *"they are just as much
motive forces of rational conduct as are economic factors"* but they
*"do not enter into exchange relationships."* How rational is an
economic system which ignores the *"health, happiness and contentment"*
of people? Or the beauty of their surroundings? Which, moreover,
penalises those who take these factors into consideration? For
anarchists, Mises comments indicate well the inverted logic of
capitalism. That Mises can support a system which ignores the needs of
individuals, their happiness, health, surroundings, environment and so
on by *"its very nature"* says a lot. His suggestion that we assign
monetary values to such dimensions begs the question and has
plausibility only if it assumes what it is supposed to prove. [**Op.
Cit.**, p. 99-100] Indeed, the person who would put a price on
friendship simply would have no friends as they simply do not understand
what friendship is and are thereby excluded from much which is best in
human life. Likewise for other *"extra-economic"* goods that
individual's value, such as beautiful places, happiness, the environment
and so on.

So essential information required for sensible decision making would
have to be recorded and communicated in a communist society and used to
evaluate different options using agreed methods of comparison. This
differs drastically from the price mechanism as it recognises that
mindless, automatic calculation is impossible in social choices. Such
choices have an unavoidable ethical and social dimension simply because
they involve other human beings and the environment. As Mises himself
acknowledged, monetary calculation does not capture such dimensions.

We, therefore, need to employ practical judgement in making choices
aided by a full understanding of the **real** social and ecological
costs involved using, of course, the appropriate *"aids to the mind."*
Given that an anarchist society would be complex and integrated, such
aids would be essential but, due to its decentralised nature, it need
not embrace the price mechanism. It can evaluate the efficiency of its
decisions by looking at the **real** costs involved to society rather
than embrace the distorted system of costing explicit in the price
mechanism (as Kropotkin once put it, *"if we analyse **price**"* we must
*"make a distinction between its different elements"*. [**Op. Cit.**, p.
72]).

In summary, then, Mises considered only central planning as genuine
socialism, meaning that a decentralised communism was not addressed.
Weighting up the pros and cons of how to use millions of different goods
in the millions of potential situations they could be used would be
impossible in a centralised system, yet in decentralised communism this
is not an issue. Each individual commune and syndicate would be choosing
from the few alternatives required to meet their needs. With the needs
known, the alternatives can be compared -- particularly if agreed
criteria (*"aids to the mind"*) are utilised and the appropriate agreed
information communicated.

Efficient economic decision making in a moneyless "economy" is possible,
assuming that sufficient information is passed between syndicates and
communes to evaluate the relative and absolute costs of a good. Thus,
decisions can be reached which aimed to reduce the use of goods in short
supply or which take large amounts of resources to produce (or which
produce large externalities to create). While a **centralised** system
would be swamped by the large number of different uses and combinations
of goods, a **decentralised** communist system would not be.

Thus, anarchists argue that Mises was wrong. Communism **is** viable,
but only if it is **libertarian** communism. Ultimately, though, the
real charge is not that socialism is *"impossible"* but rather that it
would be inefficient, i.e., it would allocate resources such that too
much is used to achieve specified goals and that there would be no way
to check that the allocated resources were valued sufficiently to
warrant their use in the first place. While some may portray this as a
case of planning against markets (no-planning), this is false. Planning
occurs in capitalism (as can be seen from any business), it is a
question of whether capitalism ensures that more plans can be
co-ordinated and needs meet by means of relative prices and profit-loss
accounting than by communism (free access and distribution according to
need). As such, the question is does the capitalist system adds
additional problems to the efficient co-ordination of plans? Libertarian
communists argue, yes, it does (as we discuss at length in [section
I.1.5](secI1.html#seci15)).

All choices involve lost possibilities, so the efficient use of
resources is required to increase the possibilities for creating other
goods. At best, all you can say is that by picking options which cost
the least a market economy will make more resources available for other
activities. Yet this assumption crucially depends equating "efficient"
with profitable, a situation which cannot be predicted beforehand and
which easily leads to inefficient allocation of resources (particularly
if we are looking at meeting human needs). Then there are the costs of
using money for if we are talking of opportunity costs, of the freeing
up of resources for other uses, then the labour and other resources used
to process money related activities should be included. While these
activities (banking, advertising, defending property, and so forth) are
essential to a capitalist economy, they are not needed and unproductive
from the standpoint of producing use values or meeting human need. This
would suggest that a libertarian communist economy would have a
productive advantage over a capitalist economy as the elimination of
this structural waste intrinsic to capitalism will free up a vast amount
of labour and materials for socially useful production. This is not to
mention the so-called "costs" which are no such thing, but relate to
capitalist property rights. Thus "rent" may be considered a cost under
capitalism, but would disappear if those who used a resource controlled
it rather than pay a tribute to gain access to it. As Kropotkin argued,
*"the capitalist system makes us pay for everything three or four times
its labour value"* thanks to rent, profit, interest and the actions of
middle men. Such system specific "costs" hide the actual costs (in terms
of labour and resource use) by increasing the price compared to if we
*"reckon our expenses in labour"*. [**Op. Cit.**, p. 68]

Moreover, somewhat ironically, this "economising" of resources which the
market claims to achieve is not to conserve resources for future
generations or to ensure environmental stability. Rather, it is to allow
**more** goods to be produced in order to accumulate more capital. It
could be argued that the market forces producers to minimise costs on
the assumption that lower costs will be more likely to result in higher
profits. However, this leaves the social impact of such cost-cutting out
of the equation. For example, imposing externalities on others does
reduce a firm's prices and, as a result, is rewarded by the market
however alienating and exhausting work or rising pollution levels does
not seem like a wise thing to do. So, yes, it is true that a capitalist
firm will seek to minimise costs in order to maximise profits. This, at
first glance, could be seen as leading to an efficient use of resources
until such time as the results of this become clear. Thus goods could be
created which do not last as long as they could, which need constant
repairing, etc. So a house produced "efficiently" under capitalism could
be a worse place to live simply because costs were reduced by cutting
corners (less insulation, thinner walls, less robust materials, etc.).
In addition, the collective outcome of all these "efficient" decisions
could be socially inefficient as they reduce the quality of life of
those subject to them as well as leading to over-investment,
over-production, falling profits and economic crisis. As such, it could
be argued that Mises' argument exposes more difficulties for capitalism
rather than for anarchism.

Finally, it should be noted that most anarchists would question the
criteria Hayek and Mises used to judge the relative merits of communism
and capitalism. As the former put it, the issue was *"a distribution of
income independent of private property in the means of production and a
volume of output which was at least approximately the same or even
greater than that procured under free competition."* [*"The Nature and
History of the Problem"*, **Op. Cit.**, p. 37] Thus the issue is reduced
to that of output (quantity), not issues of freedom (quality). If
slavery or Stalinism **had** produced more output than free market
capitalism, that would not make either system desirable This was, in
fact, a common argument against Stalinism during the 1950s and 1960s
when it **did** appear that central planning was producing more goods
(and, ironically, by the propertarian right against the welfare state
for, it should be remembered, that volume of output, like profitability
and so "efficiency", in the market depends on income distribution and a
redistribution from rich to poor could easily result in more output
becoming profitable). Similarly, that capitalism produces more alcohol
and Prozac to meet the higher demand for dulling the minds of those
trying to survive under it would **not** be an argument against
libertarian communism! As we discuss in [section I.4](secI4.html), while
anarchists seek to meet material human needs we do not aim, as under
capitalism, to sacrifice all other goals to that aim as capitalism does.
Thus, to state the obvious, the aim for maximum volume of output only
makes sense under capitalism as the maximum of human happiness and
liberty may occur with a lower volume of output in a free society. The
people of a society without oppression, exploitation and alienation will
hardly act in identical ways, nor seek the same volume of output, as
those in one, like capitalism, marked by those traits!

Moreover, the volume of output is a somewhat misleading criteria as it
totally ignores its distribution. If the bulk of that volume goes to a
few, then that is hardly a good use of resources. This is hardly an
academic concern as can be seen from the Hayek influenced neo-liberalism
of the 1980s onwards. As economist Paul Krugman notes, the value of the
output of an average worker *"has risen almost 50 percent since 1973.
Yet the growing concentration of income in the hands of a small minority
had proceeded so rapidly that we're not sure whether the typical
American has gained anything from rising productivity."* This means that
wealth have flooded upwards, and *"the lion's share of economic growth
in America over the past thirty years has gone to a small, wealthy
minority."* [**The Conscience of a Liberal**, p. 124 and p. 244]

To conclude. Capitalist "efficiency" is hardly rational and for a fully
human and ecological efficiency libertarian communism is required. As
Buick and Crump point out, *"socialist society still has to be concerned
with using resources efficiently and rationally, but the criteria of
'efficiency' and 'rationality' are not the same as they are under
capitalism."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 137] Under communist-anarchism, the
decision-making system used to determine the best use of resources is
not more or less "efficient" than market allocation, because it goes
beyond the market-based concept of "efficiency." It does not seek to
mimic the market but to do what the market fails to do. This is
important, because the market is not the rational system its defenders
often claim. While reducing all decisions to one common factor is,
without a doubt, an easy method of decision making, it also has serious
side-effects **because** of its reductionistic basis. The market makes
decision making simplistic and generates a host of irrationalities and
dehumanising effects as a result. So, to claim that communism will be
"more" efficient than capitalism or vice versa misses the point.
Libertarian communism will be "efficient" in a totally different way and
people will act in ways considered "irrational" only under the narrow
logic of capitalism.

Calculation' controversy: unravelling of a myth"* [**Common Voice**,
Issue 3]

I.1.3 What is wrong with markets anyway?
----------------------------------------

A lot. Markets soon result in what are termed *"market forces,"*
impersonal forces which ensure that the people in the economy do what is
required of them in order for the economy to function. The market
system, in capitalist apologetics, is presented to appear as a regime of
freedom where no one forces anyone to do anything, where we "freely"
exchange with others as we see fit. However, the facts of the matter are
somewhat different, since the market often ensures that people act in
ways **opposite** to what they desire or forces them to accept "free
agreements" which they may not actually desire. Wage labour is the most
obvious example of this, for, as we indicated in [section
B.4](secB4.html), most people have little option but to agree to work
for others.

We must stress here that not all anarchists are opposed to the market.
Individualist anarchists favour it while Proudhon wanted to modify it
while retaining competition. For many, the market equals capitalism but
this is not the case as it ignores the fundamental issue of (economic)
class, namely who owns the means of production. Capitalism is unique in
that it is based on wage labour, i.e. a market for labour as workers do
not own their own means of production and have to sell themselves to
those who do. Thus it is entirely possible for a market to exist within
a society and for that society **not** to be capitalist. For example, a
society of independent artisans and peasants selling their product on
the market would not be capitalist as workers would own and control
their means of production. Similarly, Proudhon's competitive system of
self-managed co-operatives and mutual banks would be non-capitalist (and
socialist) for the same reason. Anarchists object to capitalism due to
the quality of the social relationships it generates between people
(i.e. it generates authoritarian ones). If these relationships are
eliminated then the kinds of ownership which do so are anarchistic. Thus
the issue of ownership matters only in-so-far it generates relationships
of the desired kind (i.e. those based on liberty, equality and
solidarity). To concentrate purely on "markets" or "property" means to
ignore social relationships and the key aspect of capitalism, namely
wage labour. That right-wingers do this is understandable (to hide the
authoritarian core of capitalism) but why (libertarian or other)
socialists should do so is less clear.

In this section of the FAQ we discuss anarchist objections to the market
**as such** rather than the capitalist market. The workings of the
market do have problems with them which are independent of, or made
worse by, the existence of wage-labour. It is these problems which make
most anarchists hostile to the market and so desire a (libertarian)
communist society. So, even if we assume a mutualist (a libertarian
market-socialist) system of competing self-managed workplaces, then
communist anarchists would argue that market forces would soon result in
many irrationalities occurring.

Most obviously, operating in a market means submitting to the profit
criterion. This means that however much workers might want to employ
social criteria in their decision making, they cannot. To ignore
profitability would cause their firm to go bankrupt. Markets, therefore,
create conditions that compel producers to decide things which are not
be in their, or others, interest, such as introducing deskilling or
polluting technology, working longer hours, and so on, in order to
survive on the market. For example, a self-managed workplace will be
more likely to invest in safe equipment and working practices, this
would still be dependent on finding the money to do so and may still
increase the price of their finished product. So we could point to the
numerous industrial deaths and accidents which are due to market forces
making it unprofitable to introduce adequate safety equipment or working
conditions, (conservative estimates for industrial deaths in the USA are
between 14,000 and 25,000 per year plus over 2 million disabled), or to
increased pollution and stress levels which shorten life spans.

This tendency for self-managed firms to adjust to market forces by
increasing hours, working more intensely, allocating resources to
accumulating equipment rather than leisure time or consumption can be
seen in co-operatives under capitalism. While lacking bosses may reduce
this tendency in a post-capitalist economy, it will not eliminate it.
This is why many socialists, including anarchists, call the way markets
force unwilling members of a co-operatives make such unpleasant
decisions a form of "self-exploitation" (although this is somewhat
misleading, as there no exploitation in the capitalist sense of owners
appropriating unpaid labour). For communist-anarchists, a market system
of co-operatives *"has serious limitations"* as *"a collective
enterprise is not necessarily a commune -- nor is it necessarily
communistic in its outlook."* This is because it can end up *"competing
with like concerns for resources, customers, privileges, and even
profits"* as they *"become a particularistic interest"* and *"are
subjected to the same social pressures by the market in which they must
function."* This *"tends increasingly to encroach on their higher
ethical goals -- generally, in the name of 'efficiency', and the need to
'grow' if they are to survive, and the overwhelming temptation to
acquire larger earnings."* [Murray Bookchin, **Remaking Society**, pp.
193-4]

Similarly, a market of self-managed firms would still suffer from booms
and slumps as the co-operatives response to changes in prices would
still result in over-production (see [section C.7.2](secC7.html#secc72))
and over-investment (see [section C.7.3](secC7.html#secc73)). While the
lack of non-labour income would help reduce the severity of the business
cycle, it seems unlikely to eliminate it totally. Equally, many of the
problems of market-increased uncertainty and the destabilising aspects
of price signals discussed in [section I.1.5](secI1.html#seci15) are
just as applicable to all markets, including post-capitalist ones.

This is related to the issue of the *"tyranny of small decisions"* we
highlighted in [section B.6](secB6.html). This suggests that the
aggregate effect of individual decisions produces social circumstances
which are irrational and against the interests of those subject to them.
This is the case with markets, where competition results in economic
pressures which force its participants to act in certain ways, ways they
would prefer not to do but, as isolated individuals or workplaces, end
up doing due to market forces. In markets, it is rational for people try
to buy cheap and sell dear. Each tries to maximise their income by
either minimising their costs or maximising their prices, not because
they particularly want to but because they need to as taking into
account other priorities is difficult as there is no means of finding
them out and deeply inadvisable as it is competitively suicidal as it
places burdens on firms which their competitors need not face.

As we noted in [section E.3](secE3.html), markets tend to reward those
who act in anti-social ways and externalise costs (in terms of pollution
and so on). In a market economy, it is impossible to determine whether a
low cost reflects actual efficiency or a willingness to externalise,
i.e., impose costs on others. Markets rarely internalise external costs.
Two economic agents who strike a market-rational bargain between
themselves need not consider the consequences of their bargain for other
people outside their bargain, nor the consequences for the earth. In
reality, then, market exchanges are never bilateral agreements as their
effects impact on the wider society (in terms of, say, pollution,
inequality and so on). This awkward fact is ignored in the market. As
the left-wing economist Joan Robinson put it: *"In what industry, in
what line of business, are the true social costs of the activity
registered in its accounts? Where is the pricing system that offers the
consumer a fair choice between air to breath and motor cars to drive
about in?"* [**Contribution to Modern Economics**, p. 10]

While, to be fair, there will be a reduced likelihood for a workplace of
self-employed workers to pollute their own neighbourhoods in a free
society, the competitive pressures and rewards would still be there and
it seems unlikely that they will be ignored, particularly if survival on
the market is at stake so communist-anarchists fear that while not
having bosses, capitalists and landlords would mitigate some of the
irrationalities associated with markets under capitalism, it will not
totally remove them. While the market may be free, people would not be.

Even if we assume that self-managed firms resist the temptations and
pressures of the market, any market system is also marked by a
continuing need to expand production and consumption. In terms of
environmental impact, a self-managed firm must still make profits in
order to survive and so the economy must grow. As such, every market
system will tend to expand into an environment which is of fixed size.
As well as placing pressure on the planet's ecology, this need to grow
impacts on human activity as it also means that market forces ensure
that work continually has to expand. Competition means that we can never
take it easy, for as Max Stirner argued, *"[r]estless acquisition does
not let us take breath, take a calm **enjoyment**. We do not get the
comfort of our possessions . . . Hence it is at any rate helpful that we
come to an agreement about **human** labours that they may not, as under
competition, claim all our time and toil."* [**The Ego and Its Own**, p.
268] Value needs to be created, and that can only be done by labour and
so even a non-capitalist market system will see work dominate people's
lives. Thus the need to survive on the market can impact on broader
(non-monetary) measures of welfare, with quality of life falling as a
higher GDP is created as the result of longer working hours with fewer
holidays. Such a regime may, perhaps, be good for material wealth but it
is not great for people.

The market can also block the efficient use of resources. For example,
for a long time energy efficient light-bulbs were much more expensive
than normal ones. Over the long period, however, they used far less
energy than normal ones, meaning less need to produce more energy (and
so burn coal and oil, for example). However, the high initial price
ensured that most people continued to use the less efficient bulbs and
so waste resources. Much the same can be said of alternative forms of
energy, with investment in (say) wind energy ignored in favour of
one-use and polluting energy sources. A purely market system would not
allow decisions which benefit the long-term interests of people to be
made (for example, by distributing energy-efficient light-bulbs freely
or at a reduced cost) as these would harm the profits of those
co-operatives which tried to do so.

Also, markets do not reflect the values of things we do not put a price
upon (as we argued in [section B.5](secB5.html)). It cannot protect
wilderness, for example, simply because it requires people to turn it
into property and sell it as a commodity. If you cannot afford to visit
the new commodity, the market turns it into something else, no matter
how much you value it. The market also ignores the needs of future
generations as they always discount the value of the long term future. A
payment to be made 1,000 years from now (a mere speck in geological
time) has a market value of virtually zero according to any commonly
used discount rate. Even 50 years in the future cannot be adequately
considered as competitive pressures force a short term perspective on
people harmful to present and future generations, plus the ecology of
the planet.

Then there are corrosive effects of the market on human personalities.
As we have argued elsewhere (see [section B.1.3](secB1.html#secb13)),
competition in a free market creates numerous problems -- for example,
the creation of an *"ethics of mathematics"* and the strange inversion
of values in which things (property/money) become more important than
people. This can have a de-humanising effect, with people becoming
cold-hearted calculators who put profits before people. This can be seen
in capitalism, where economic decisions are far more important than
ethical ones -- particularly as such an inhuman mentality can be
rewarded on the market. Merit does not necessarily breed success, and
the successful do not necessarily have merit. The truth is that, in the
words of Noam Chomsky, *"wealth and power tend to accrue to those who
are ruthless, cunning, avaricious, self-seeking, lacking in sympathy and
compassion, subservient to authority and willing to abandon principle
for material gain, and so on . . . Such qualities might be just the
valuable ones for a war of all against all."* [**For Reasons of State**,
pp. 139-140]

Needless to be said, if the market does reward such people with success
it can hardly be considered as a **good** thing. A system which elevates
making money to the position of the most important individual activity
will obviously result in the degrading of human values and an increase
in neurotic and psychotic behaviour. Little wonder, as Alfie Kohn has
argued, competition can have serious negative effects on us outside of
work, with it damaging both our personal psychology and our
interpersonal relationships. Thus competition *"itself is responsible
for the development of a lower moral standard"* which places winning at
any cost above fairness and justice. Kohn quotes Nathan Ackerman, the
father of family therapy, who noted that the *"strife of competition
reduces empathic sympathy, distorts communication, impairs the mutuality
of support and sharing, and decreases the satisfaction of personal
need."* [**No Contest**, p. 163 and pp. 142-3] Thus, the market can
impoverish us as individuals, sabotaging self-esteem, promoting
conformity, ruining relationships and making us less than what we could
be. This is a problem of markets as such, not only capitalist ones and
so non-capitalist markets could make us less human and more a robot.

All market decisions are crucially conditioned by the purchasing power
of those income groups that can back their demands with money. Not
everyone can work (the sick, the very old, children and so forth) and
for those who can, personal circumstances may impact on their income.
Moreover, production has become so interwoven that it *"is utterly
impossible to draw a distinction between the work of each"* and so we
should *"put the **needs** above the **works**, and first of all to
recognise **the right to live**, and later on **the right to
well-being** for all those who took their share in production."* This is
particularly the case as *"the needs of the individual, do not always
correspond to his **works**"* -- for example, *"a man of forty, father
of three children, has other needs than a young man of twenty"* and
*"the woman who suckles her infant and spends sleepless nights at its
bedside, cannot do as much **work** as the man who has slept
peacefully."* [Kropotkin, **Conquest of Bread**, p. 170 and p. 171] This
was why communist-anarchists like Kropotkin stressed the need not only
to abolish wage-labour but also money, the wages system.

So it goes without saying that purchasing power (demand) and need are
not related, with people often suffering simply because they do not have
the money required to purchase, say, health care, housing or food for
themselves or their families. While economic distress may be less in a
non-capitalist market system, it still would exist as would the fear of
it. The market is a continuous bidding for goods, resources, and
services, with those who have the most purchasing power the winners.
This means that the market system is the worst one for allocating
resources when purchasing power is unequally distributed (this is why
orthodox economists make the convenient assumption of a *"given
distribution of income"* when they try to show that a capitalist
allocation of resources is the best one via *"Pareto optimality"*).
While a mutualist system should reduce inequality drastically, it cannot
be assumed that inequalities will not increase over time. This is
because inequalities in resources leads to inequalities of power on the
market and, assuming self-interest, any trade or contract will benefit
the powerful more than the powerless, so re-enforcing and potentially
increasing the inequalities and power between the parties. Similarly,
while an anarchist society would be created with people driven by a
sense of solidarity and desire for equality, markets tend to erode those
feelings and syndicates or communes which, thanks to the resources they
control (such as rare raw materials or simply the size of their
investments reducing competitive pressures) have an advantage on the
market may be tempted to use their monopoly power vis-à-vis other groups
in society to accrue more income for themselves at the expense of less
fortunate syndicates and communes. This could degenerate back into
capitalism as any inequalities that exist between co-operatives would be
increased by competition, forcing weaker co-operatives to fail and so
creating a pool of workers with nothing to sell but their labour. The
successful co-operatives could then hire those workers and so
re-introduce wage labour. So these possibilities could, over time, lead
to a return a post-capitalist market system to capitalism if the
inequalities become so great that the new rich become so alienated from
the rest of society they recreate wage-labour and, by necessity, a state
to enforce a desire for property in land and the means of production
against public opinion.

All this ensures that the market cannot really provide the information
necessary for rational-decision making in terms of ecological impact as
well as human activity and so resources are inefficiently allocated. We
all suffer from the consequences of that, with market forces
impoverishing our environment and quality of life. Thus are plenty of
reasons for concluding that efficiency and the market not only do not
necessarily coincide, but, indeed, necessarily do not coincide. Indeed,
rather than respond to individual needs, the market responds to money
(more correctly, profit), which by its very nature provides a distorted
indication of individual preferences (and does not take into account
values which are enjoyed collectively, such as clean air, or
**potentially** enjoyed, such as the wilderness a person may never visit
but desires to see exist and protected).

This does not mean that social anarchists propose to "ban" the market --
far from it. This would be impossible. What we do propose is to convince
people that a profit-based market system has distinctly **bad** effects
on individuals, society and the planet's ecology, and that we can
organise our common activity to replace it with libertarian communism.
As Max Stirner argued, competition *"has a continued existence"* because
*"all do not attend to **their** **affair** and come to an
**understanding** with each other about it . . . . Abolishing
competition is not equivalent to favouring the guild. The difference is
this: In the **guild** baking, etc., is the affair of the
guild-brothers; in **competition**, the affair of chance competitors; in
the **union**, of those who require baked goods, and therefore my
affair, yours, the affair of neither guildic nor the concessionary
baker, but the affair of the **united.**"* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 275]

Therefore, social anarchists do not appeal purely to altruism in their
struggle against the de-humanising effects of the market, but also to to
egoism: the simple fact that co-operation and mutual aid is in our best
interests as individuals. By co-operating and controlling *"the affairs
of the united,"* we can ensure a free society which is worth living in,
one in which the individual is not crushed by market forces and has time
to fully develop his or her individuality and uniqueness:

> *"Solidarity is therefore the state of being in which Man attains the
> greatest degree of security and wellbeing; and therefore egoism
> itself, that is the exclusive consideration of one's own interests,
> impels Man and human society towards solidarity."* [Errico Malatesta,
> **Anarchy**, p. 30]

In conclusion then, communist-anarchists argue that even non-capitalist
markets would result in everyone being so busy competing to further
their "self-interest" that they would loose sight of what makes life
worth living and so harm their **actual** interests. Ultimately, what
counts as self-interest is shaped by the surrounding social system. The
pressures of competing may easily result in short-term and narrow
interests taking precedence over richer, deeper needs and aspirations
which a communal system could allow to flourish by providing the social
institutions by which individuals can discuss their joint interests,
formulate them and act to achieve them. That is, even non-capitalist
markets would result in people simply working long and hard to survive
on the market rather than **living**. If one paradox of authoritarian
socialism is that it makes everyone miserable by forcing them to
altruistically look out for the happiness of others, market-based
libertarian socialism could produce the potential paradox of making
everyone miserable by the market forcing them to pursue a limited notion
of self-interest which ensures that they do not have the time or
opportunity to really be happy and at one with themselves and others.

In other words, bosses act as they do under capitalism in part because
markets force them to. Getting rid of bosses need not eliminate all the
economic pressures which influence the bosses' decisions and, in turn,
could force groups of workers to act in similar ways. Thus a competitive
system would undermine many of the benefits which people sought when
they ended capitalism. This is why some socialists inaccurately call
socialist schemes of competing co-operatives "self-managed capitalism"
or "self-exploitation" -- they are simply drawing attention to the
negative aspects of markets which getting rid of the boss cannot solve.
Significantly, Proudhon was well aware of the negative aspect of market
forces and suggested various institutional structures, such as the
ago-industrial federation, to combat them (so while in favour of
competition he was, unlike the individualist anarchists, against the
free market). Communist anarchists, unsurprisingly, argue that
individualist anarchists tend to stress the positive aspects of
competition while ignoring or downplaying its negative sides. While,
undoubtedly, capitalism makes the negative side of competition worse
than it could be it does not automatically follow that a non-capitalist
market would not have similar, if smaller, negative aspects to it.

I.1.4 If capitalism is exploitative, then isn't socialism as well?
------------------------------------------------------------------

Some libertarian Marxists (as well as Leninists) claim that
non-communist forms of socialism are just "self-managed" capitalism.
Strangely, propertarians (the so-called "libertarian" right) also say
yes to this question, arguing that socialist opposition to exploitation
does not imply socialism but what they also call "self-managed"
capitalism. Thus some on the left proclaim anything short of communism
is a form of capitalism while, on the right, some proclaim that
communism is exploitative and only a market system (which they
erroneously equate to capitalism) is non-exploitative.

Both are wrong. First, and most obviously, socialism does not equal
communism (and vice versa). While there is a tendency on both right and
left to equate socialism with communism (particularly Marxism), in
reality, as Proudhon once noted, socialism *"was not founded as a sect
or church; it has seen a number of different schools."* [**Selected
Writings of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon**, p. 177] Only a few of these
schools are communist, just as only a few of them are libertarian.
Second, not all socialist schools aim to abolish the market and payment
by deed. Proudhon, for example, opposed communism and state socialism
just as much as he opposed capitalism. Third, capitalism does not equal
the market. The market predates capitalism and, for some libertarian
socialists, will survive it. Even from a Marxist position, a noted in
[section I.1.1](secI.html#seci11), the defining feature of capitalism is
**wage labour**, not the market.

Why some socialists desire to reduce the choices facing humanity to
either communism or some form of capitalism is frankly strange, but also
understandable because of the potential dehumanising effects of market
systems (as shown under capitalism). Why the propertarian right wishes
to do so is more clear, as it aims to discredit all forms of socialism
by equating them to communism (which, in turn, it equates to central
planning and Stalinism).

Yet this is not a valid inference to make. Opposition to capitalism can
imply both socialism (distribution according to deed, or selling the
product of ones labour) and communism (distribution according to need,
or a moneyless economy). The theory is a critique of capitalism, based
on an analysis of that system as being rooted in the exploitation of
labour (as we discussed in [section C.2](secC2.html)), i.e., it is
marked by workers not being paid the full-value of the goods they
create. This analysis, however, is not necessarily the basis of a
socialist economy although it **can** be considered this as well. As
noted, Proudhon used his critique of capitalism as an exploitative
system as the foundation of his proposals for mutual banking and
co-operatives. Marx, on the other hand, used a similar analysis as
Proudhon's purely as a critique of capitalism while hoping for
communism. Robert Owen used it as the basis of his system of labour
notes while Kropotkin argued that such a system was just the
wages-system under another form and a free society *"having taken
possession of all social wealth, having boldly proclaimed the right of
all to this wealth . . . will be compelled to abandon any system of
wages, whether in currency or labour-notes."* [**The Conquest of
Bread**, p. 167]

In other words, though a system of co-operative selling on the market
(what is mistakenly termed "self-managed" capitalism by some) or
exchanging labour-time values would not be communism, it is **not**
capitalism. This is because the workers are not separated from the means
of production. Therefore, the attempts by propertarians to claim that it
is capitalism are false, an example of misinformed insistence that
virtually **every** economic system, bar state socialism and feudalism,
is capitalist. However, it could be argued that communism (based on free
access and communal ownership of all resources including the product of
labour) would mean that workers are exploited by non-workers (the young,
the sick, the elderly and so on). As communism abolishes the link
between performance and payment, it could be argued that the workers
under communism would be just as exploited as under capitalism, although
(of course) not by a class of capitalists and landlords but by the
community. As Proudhon put it, while the *"members of a community, it is
true, have no private property"* the community itself *"is proprietor"*
and so communism *"is inequality, but not as property is. Property is
the exploitation of the weak by the strong. Communism is the
exploitation of the strong by the weak."* [**What is Property?**, p.
250]

Needless to say, subsequent anarchists rejected Proudhon's blanket
opposition to all forms of communism, rejecting this position as only
applicable to authoritarian, not libertarian, communism. Which, it must
be remembered, was the only kind around when this was written in 1840
(as we noted in [section H.1](secH1.html), what was known as communism
in Proudhon's time was authoritarian). Suffice to say, Proudhon's
opposition to communism shares little with that of the
Propertarian-right, which reflects the sad lack of personal empathy (and
so ethics) of the typical defender of capitalism. However, the notion
that communism (distribution according to need) rather than socialism
(distribution according to deed) is exploitative misses the point as far
as communist anarchism goes. This is because of two reasons.

Firstly, *"Anarchist Communism . . . means voluntary Communism,
Communism from free choice."* [Alexander Berkman, **What is Anarchism**,
p. 148] This means it is not imposed on anyone but is created and
practised only by those who believe in it.

Therefore it would be up to the communities and syndicates to decide how
they wish to distribute the products of their labour and individuals to
join, or create, those that meet their ideas of right and wrong. Some
may decide on equal pay, others on payment in terms of labour time, yet
others on communistic associations. The important thing to realise is
that individuals and the co-operatives they join will decide what to do
with their output, whether to exchange it or to distribute it freely.
Hence, because it is based on free agreement, communism-anarchism cannot
be exploitative. Members of a commune or co-operative which is
communistic are free to leave, after all. Needless to say, the
co-operatives will usually distribute their product to others within
their confederation and exchange with the non-communist ones in a
different manner. We say "usually" for in the case of emergencies like
earthquakes and so forth the situation would call for, and produce,
mutual aid just as it does today to a large degree, even under
capitalism.

The reason why capitalism is exploitative is that workers **have** to
agree to give the product of their labour to another (the boss, the
landlord) in order to be employed in the first place (see [section
B.4](secB4.html)). While they can choose who to be exploited by (and, to
varying degrees, pick the best of the limited options available to them)
they cannot avoid selling their liberty to property owners (a handful do
become self-employed and some manage to join the exploiting class, but
not enough to make either a meaningful option for the bulk of the
working class). In libertarian communism, by contrast, the workers
themselves agree to distribute part of their product to others (i.e.
society as a whole, their neighbours, friends, and so forth). It is
based on free agreement, while capitalism is marked by power, authority,
and the firm (invisible) hand of market forces (supplemented, as
necessary, by the visible fist of the state). As resources are held in
common under anarchism, people always have the option of working alone
if they so desired (see [section I.3.7](secI3.html#seci37)).

Secondly, unlike under capitalism, there is no separate class which is
appropriating the goods produced. The so-called "non-workers" in a
libertarian communist society have been, or will be, workers. As the
noted Spanish anarchist De Santillan pointed out, *"[n]aturally,
children, the aged and the sick are not considered parasites. The
children will be productive when they grow up. The aged have already
made their contribution to social wealth and the sick are only
temporarily unproductive."* [**After the Revolution**, p. 20] In other
words, over their life time, everyone contributes to society and so
using the "account book" mentality of capitalism misses the point. As
Kropotkin put it:

> *"Services rendered to society, be they work in factory or field, or
> mental services, **cannot be** valued in money. There can be no exact
> measure of value (of what has been wrongly-termed exchange value), nor
> of use value, with regard to production. If two individuals work for
> the community five hours a day, year in year out, at different work
> which is equally agreeable to them, we may say that on the whole their
> labour is equivalent. But we cannot divide their work, and say that
> the result of any particular day, hour, or minute of work of the one
> is worth the result of a minute or hour of the other."* [**Conquest of
> Bread**, p. 168]

So it is difficult to evaluate how much an individual worker or group of
workers actually contribute to society. This can be seen whenever
workers strike, particularly so-called "key" areas like transport. Then
the media is full of accounts of how much the strike is costing "the
economy" and it is always far more than that of the wages lost in strike
action. Yet, according to capitalist economics, the wages of a worker
are equal to their contribution to production -- no more, no less.
Striking workers, in other words, should only harm the economy to the
value of their wages yet, of course, this is obviously not the case.
This is because of the interconnected nature of any advanced economy,
where contributions of individuals are so bound together.

Needless to say, this does not imply that a free people would tolerate
the able-bodied simply taking without contributing towards the mass of
products and services society. As we discuss in [section
I.4.14](secI4.html#seci414), such people will be asked to leave the
community and be in the same situation as those who do not wish to be
communists.

Ultimately, the focus on calculating exact amounts and on the evaluation
of contributions down to the last penny is exactly the kind of
narrow-minded account-book mentality which makes most people socialists
in the first place. It would be ironic if, in the name of
non-exploitation, a similar accounting mentality to that which records
how much surplus value is extracted from workers under capitalism is
continued into a free society. It makes life easier not to have to worry
whether you can afford to visit the doctors or dentists, not to have to
pay for use of roads and bridges, know that you can visit a public
library for a book and so forth. For those who wish to spend their time
calculating such activities and seeking to pay the community for them
simply because they hate the idea of being "exploited" by the "less"
productive, the ill, the young or the old then we are sure that a
libertarian communist society will accommodate them (although we are
sure that emergencies will be an exception and they will be given free
access to communal hospitals, fire services and so forth).

Thus the notion that communism would be exploitative like capitalism
misses the point. While all socialists accuse capitalism for failing to
live up to its own standards, of not paying workers the full product of
their labour, most do not think that a socialist society should seek to
make that full payment a reality. Life, for libertarian communists, is
just too complex and fleeting to waste time and energy calculating
exactly the contribution of each to society. As Malatesta put it:

> *"I say that **the worker has the right to the entire product of his
> work**: but I recognise that this right is only a formula of abstract
> justice; and means, in practice, that there should be no exploitation,
> that everyone must work and enjoy the fruits of their labour,
> according to the custom agreed among them.*

> *"Workers are not isolated beings that live for themselves and for

> geographical situation or the social environment. Hence, the solution
> cannot be found in respect to the strict rights of each person, but
> must be sought in fraternal agreement, in solidarity."* [**At the
> Café**, pp. 56-7]

All in all, most anarchists reject the notion that people sharing the
world (which is all communism really means) equates to them being
exploited by others. Rather than waste time trying to record the
minutiae of who contributed exactly what to society, most anarchists are
happy if people contribute to society roughly equal amounts of time and
energy and take what they need in return. To consider such a situation
of free co-operation as exploitative is simply ridiculous (just as well
consider the family as the exploitation of its working members by their
non-working partners and children). Those who do are free to leave such
an association and pay their own way in everything (a task which would
soon drive home the simplicity and utility of communism, most anarchists
would suggest).

I.1.5 Does capitalism efficiently allocate resources?
-----------------------------------------------------

We have discussed, in [section I.1.1](secI1.html#seci11), the negative
effects of workplace hierarchy and stock markets and, in [section
I.1.2](secI1.html#seci12), the informational problems of prices and the
limitations in using profit as the sole criteria for decision making for
the efficient allocation of resources. As such, anarchists have reason
to doubt the arguments of the "Austrian" school of economics that
(libertarian) socialism is impossible, as first suggested by Ludwig Von
Mises in 1920. [*"Economic Calculation in the Socialist Commonwealth"*,
**Collectivist Economic Planning**, F.A von Hayek (ed.), pp. 87-130]
Here, we discuss why anarchists also have strong reason to question the
underlying assumption that capitalism efficiently allocates resources
and how this impacts on claims that "socialism" is impossible. This is
based on an awareness of the flaws in any (implicit) assumption that all
prices are at equilibrium, the issue of uncertainty, the assumption that
human well-being is best served by market forces and, lastly, the
problem of periodic economic crisis under capitalism.

The first issue is that prices only provide adequate knowledge for
rational decision making only if they are at their equilibrium values as
this equates supply and demand. Sadly, for the "Austrian" school and its
arguments against socialism, it rejects the notion that prices could be
at equilibrium. While modern "Austrian" economics is keen to stress its
(somewhat underdeveloped) disequilibrium analysis of capitalism, this
was not always the case. When Mises wrote his 1920 essay on socialism
his school of economics was considered a branch of the neo-classicalism
and this can be seen from Mises' critique of central planning. In fact,
it would be fair to say that the neo-"Austrian" focus of prices as
information and (lip-service to) disequilibrium flowed from the Economic
Calculation debate, specifically the awkward fact that their more
orthodox neo-classical peers viewed Lange's "solution" as answering
Mises and Hayek.

Thus there is a fundamental inconsistency in Mises' argument, namely
that while Austrian economics reject the notion of equilibrium and the
perfect competition of neo-classical economics he nonetheless maintains
that market prices are the correct prices and can be used to make
rational decisions. Yet, in any real market, these correct prices must
be ever changing so making the possibility that *"precise"* economic
decisions by price can go wrong on a large scale (i.e., in slumps). In
other words, Mises effectively assumed away uncertainty and, moreover,
failed to mention that this uncertainty is increased dramatically within
capitalism.

This can be seen from modern "Austrian" economics which, after the
Economic Calculation debates of the 1920s and 1930s, moved increasingly
away from neo-classical equilibrium theory. However, this opened up a
whole new can of worms which, ironically, weakened the "Austrian" case
against socialism. For the modern "Austrian" economist, the economy is
considered not to be in equilibrium, with entrepreneur being seen as the
means by which it brought towards it. Thus *"this approach postulates a
tendency for profit opportunities to be **discovered** and **grasped**
by routine-resisting entrepreneurial market participants"*, with this
*"tending to nudge the market in the equilibrative direction."*
Lip-service is paid to the obvious fact that entrepreneurs can make
errors but *"**there is no tendency for entrepreneurial errors to be
made.** The tendency which the market generates toward greater mutual
awareness, is not offset by any equal but opposite tendency in the
direction of diminishing awareness"* and so the *"entrepreneurial market
process may indeed reflect a systematically equilibrative **tendency**,
but this by no means constitutes a **guaranteed** unidirectional,
flawlessly converging trajectory."* All this results on the
*"speculative actions of entrepreneurs who see opportunities for pure
profit in the conditions of disequilibrium."* [Israel M. Kirzner,
*"Entrepreneurial Discovery and the Competitive Market Process: An
Austrian Approach"*, pp. 60-85, **Journal of Economic Literature**, Vol.
35, No. 1, p. 71, p. 73, p. 82, p. 72 and p. 68]

When evaluating this argument, it is useful to remember that
*"postulate"* means **"to assume without proof to be true"** or **"to
take as self-evident."** At its most simple, this argument ignores how
entrepreneurial activity pushes an economy **away** from equilibrium
(unlike radical economists, only a few "Austrian" economists, such as
those who follow Ludwig Lachmann, recognise that market forces have both
equilibrating **and** disequilibrium effects, acknowledged in passing by
Kirzner: *"In a world of incessant change, they argue, it is precisely
those acts of entrepreneurial boldness which must frustrate any
discovery efforts made by fellow entrepreneurs."* [**Op. Cit.**, p.
79]). In other words, market activity can lead to economic crisis and
inefficient allocation decisions. A successful entrepreneur will, by
their actions, frustrate the plans of others, most obviously those of
his competitors but also those who require the goods they used to
produce their commodities and those whose incomes are reduced by the new
products being available. It staggers belief to think that **every**
action by a firm will be step towards equilibrium or a better
co-ordination of plans, particularly if you include **unsuccessful**
entrepreneurs into the process. In other words, the market can be as
discoordinating as it can be co-ordinating and it cannot be "postulated"
beforehand which will predominate at any given time.

There is an obvious example of entrepreneurial activity which leads to
increasing disequilibrium, one (ironically) drawn straight from
"Austrian" economics itself. This is the actions of bankers extending
credit and so deviating from the "natural" (equilibrium) rate of
interest. As one post-Keynesian economist notes, this, the "Austrian"
theory of the business cycle, *"not only proved to be vulnerable to the
Cambridge capital critique . . . , but also appeared to reply upon
concepts of equilibrium (the 'natural rate of interest', for example)
that were inconsistent with the broader principles of Austrian economic
theory."* [J.E. King, **A history of post Keynesian economics since
1936**, p. 230] As we discussed in [section C.8](secC8.html), this kind
of activity is to be expected of entrepreneurs seeking to make money
from meeting market demand. The net result of this activity is a
tendency **away** from equilibrium. This can be generalised for all
markets, with the profit seeking activities of some businesses
frustrating the plans of others. Ultimately, the implication that all
entrepreneurial activity is stabilising, virtuous arbitrage that removes
disequilibria is unconvincing as the suggestion that the misinformation
conveyed by disequilibrium prices can cause very substantial
macroeconomic distortions for only one good (credit). Surely, the
argument as regards interest rates can apply to other disequilibrium
prices, with responses to unsustainable prices for other goods being
equally capable of generating mal-investment (which only becomes
apparent when the prices adjust towards their "natural" levels). After
all, any single price distortion leads to all other prices becoming
distorted because of the ramifications for exchange ratios throughout
the economy.

One of the reasons why neo-classical economists stress equilibrium is
that prices only provide the basis for rational calculation only in that
state for disequilibrium prices can convey extremely misleading
information. When people trade at disequilibrium prices, it has serious
impacts on the economy (which is why neo-classical economics abstracts
from it). As one economist notes, if people *"were to buy and sell at
prices which did not clear the market"* then once *"such trading has
taken place, there can be no guarantee that, even if an equilibrium
exists, the economy will ever converge to it. In fact, it is likely to
move in cycles around the equilibrium."* This *"is more than a mere
supposition. It is an accurate description of what does happen in the
real world."* [Paul Ormerod, **The Death of Economics**, pp. 87-8] Once
we dismiss the ideologically driven *"postulate"* of "Austrian"
economics, we can see how these opportunities for "pure profit" (and, of
course, a corresponding pure lose for the buyer) impacts on the economy
and how the market system adds to uncertainty. As dissident economist
Steve Keen puts it:

> *"However, a change in prices in one market will affect consumer
> demand in all other markets. This implies that a move towards
> equilibrium by one market could cause some or all others to move away

> other markets, making the dance of many markets even more chaotic."*
> [**Debunking Economics**, p. 169]

That prices can, and do, convey extremely misleading information is
something which "Austrians" have a tendency to downplay. Yet in
economies closer to their ideal (for example, nineteenth century
America) there were many more recessions (usually triggered by financial
crises arising from the collapse of speculative bubbles) than in the
twentieth and so the economy was fundamentally more unstable, resulting
in the market "precisely" investing in the "wrong" areas. Of course, it
could be argued that there was not really free market capitalism then
(e.g., protectionism, no true free banking due to regulation by state
governments and so on) yet this would be question begging in the extreme
(particularly since the end of the 20th and dawn of the 21st centuries
saw speculative crises precisely in those areas which were regulated
least).

Thus, the notion that prices can ensure the efficient allocation of
resources is question begging. If prices are in disequilibrium, as
"Austrians" suggest, then the market does not automatically ensure that
they move towards equilibrium. Without equilibrium, we cannot say that
prices provide companies sufficient information to make rational
investment decisions. They may act on price information which is
misleading, in that it reflects temporary highs or lows in the market or
which is a result of speculative bubbles. An investment decision made on
the **mis**-information implied in disequilibrium prices is as likely to
produce mal-investment and subsequent macro-economic distortions as
decisions made in light of the interest rate not being at its "natural"
(equilibrium) value. So unless it is assumed that the market is in
equilibrium when an investment decision is made then prices can reflect
misinformation as much as information. These, the obvious implications
of disequilibrium, help undermine Mises' arguments against socialism.

Even if we assume that prices are at or, at best, near equilibrium when
investment decisions are made, the awkward fact is that these prices do
not tell you prices in the future nor what will be bought when
production is finished. Rather, they tell you what was **thought** to be
profitable before **investment began**. There are always differences
between the prices used to cost various investments and the prices which
prevail on the market when the finished goods are finally sold,
suggesting that the market presents systematically misleading signals.
In addition, rival companies respond to the same price signals by
undertaking long term investments at the same time, so creating the
possibility of a general crisis of over-accumulate and over-production
when they are complete. As we discussed in [section
C.7.2](secC7.html#secc72), this is a key factor in the business cycle.
Hence the recurring possibility of over-production, when the aggregate
response to a specific market's rising price results in the market being
swamped by good, so driving the market price down. Thus the market is
marked by uncertainty, the future is not known. So it seems ironic to
read Mises asserting that *"in the socialist commonwealth every economic
change becomes an undertaking whose success can be neither appraised in
advance nor later retrospectively determined. There is only groping in
the dark."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 110]

In terms of *"appraised in advance"*, Mises is essentially assuming that
capitalists can see the future. In the real world, rather than in the
unreal world of capitalist economics, the future is unknown and, as a
result, success can only be guessed at. This means that any investment
decision under **real** capitalism is, equally, *"groping in the dark"*
because there is no way to know, before hand, whether the expectations
driving the investment decisions will come to be. As Mises himself noted
as part of his attack on socialism, *"a static state is impossible in
real life, as our economic data are for ever changing"* and so, needless
to say, the success of an investment **cannot** be appraised beforehand
with any real degree of certainty. Somewhat ironically, Mises noted that
*"the static nature of economic activity is only a theoretical
assumption corresponding to no real state of affairs, however necessary
it may be for our thinking and for the perfection of our knowledge of
economics."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 109] Or, for that matter, our critique of
socialism! This can be seen from one his examples against socialism:

> *"Picture the building of a new railroad. Should it be built at all,
> and if so, which out of a number of conceivable roads should be built?
> In a competitive and monetary economy, this question would be answered
> by monetary calculation. The new road will render less expensive the
> transport of some goods, and it may be possible to calculate whether
> this reduction of expense transcends that involved in the building and
> upkeep of the next line. That can only be calculated in money."*
> [**Op. Cit.**, p. 108]

It *"may be possible"*? Not before hand. At best, an investor could
**estimate** the willingness of firms to swap to the new railroad and
whether those expected costs will result in a profit on both fixed and
running costs. The construction costs can be estimated, although
unexpected price rises in the future may make a mockery of these too,
but the amount of future income cannot. Equally, the impact of building
the new railroad will change the distribution of income as well, which
in turn affects prices across the market and people's consumption
decisions which, in turn, affects the profitability of new railroad
investment. Yet all this is ignored in order to attack socialism.

In other words, Mises assumes that the future can be accurately
predicted in order to attack socialism. Thus he asserts that a socialist
society *"would issue an edict and decide for or against the projected
building. Yet this decision would depend at best upon vague estimates;
it would never be based upon the foundation of an exact calculation of
value."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 109] Yet any investment decision in a
**real** capitalist economy depends *"at best upon vague estimates"* of
future market conditions and expected returns on the investment. This is
because accounting is backward looking, while investment depends on the
unknowable future.

In other words, *"people recognise that their economic future is
uncertain (nonergodic) and cannot be reliably predicted from existing
market information. Consequently, investment expenditures on production
facilities and people's desire to save are typically based on differing
expectations of an unknowable, uncertain future."* This means that in an
uncertain world future profits *"can neither be reliably forecasted from
existing market information, nor endogenously determined via today's
planned saving propensity of income earners . . . Thus, unless one
assumes that entrepreneurs can accurately predict the future from here
to eternity, current expectations of prospective yield must depend on
the animal optimism or pessimism of entrepreneurs"* [Paul Davidson,
**John Maynard Keynes**, pp. 62-3] So, yes, under capitalism you can
determine the money cost (price) of a building but the decision to build
is based on estimates and guesses of the future, to use Mises' words
*"vague estimates."* A change in the market can mean that even a
building which is constructed exactly to expected costs does not produce
a profit and so sits empty. Even in terms of *"exact calculation"* of
inputs these can change, so undermining the projected final cost and so
its profit margin.

For a good explanation of the problems of uncertainty, we must turn to
Keynes who placed it at the heart of his analysis of capitalism. *"The
actual results of an investment over a long term of years,"* argued
Keynes, *"very seldom agree with the initial expectation"* since *"our
existing knowledge does not provide a sufficient basis for a calculated
mathematical expectation. In point of fact, all sorts of considerations
enter into the market valuation which are in no way relevant to the
prospective yield."* He stressed that *"human decisions affecting the
future, whether personal or political or economic, cannot depend on
strict mathematical expectation, since the basis for making such
calculations does not exist."* He also suggested that the *"chief
result"* of wage flexibility *"would be to cause a great instability of
prices, so violent perhaps as to make business calculations futile."*
[**The General Theory**, p. 152, pp. 162-3 and p. 269]

Much the same can be said of other prices as well. As Proudhon argued
decades before Mises proclaimed socialism impossible, profit is
ultimately an unknown value. Under capitalism wages are the *"least that
can be given"* to a worker: *"that is, we do not know."* The *"price of
the merchandise put upon the market"* by the capitalist will be the
*"highest that he can obtain; that is, again, we do not know."*
Economics *"admits"* that *"the prices of merchandise and labour . . .
can be **estimated**"* and *"that estimation is essentially an arbitrary
operation, which never can lead to sure and certain conclusions."* Thus
capitalism is based on *"the relation between two unknowns"* which
*"cannot be determined."* [**System of Economical Contradictions**, p.
64]

So under capitalism **all** decisions are *"groping in the dark"*. Which
can, and does, lead to inefficient allocations of resources:

> *"It leads, that is to say, to **misdirected** investment. But over
> and above this it is an essential characteristic of the boom that

> that there are."* [Keynes, **Op. Cit.**, pp. 321-2]

Thus uncertainty and expectations of profit can lead to massive
allocation inefficiencies and waste. Of course Mises pays lip-service to
this uncertainty of markets. He noted that there are *"ceaseless
alternations in other economic data"* and that exchange relations are
*"subject to constant . . . fluctuations"* but those *"fluctuations
disturb value calculations only in the slightest degree"*! He admitted
that *"some mistakes are inevitable in such a calculation"* but rest
assured *"[w]hat remains of uncertainty comes into the calculation of
the uncertainty of future conditions, which is an inevitable concomitant
of the dynamic nature of economic life."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 98, p. 110
and p. 111] So, somewhat ironically, Mises assumed that, when attacking
socialism, that prices are so fluid that no central planning agency
could ever compute their correct price and so allocated resources
inefficiently yet, when it comes to capitalism, prices are not so fluid
that they make investment decisions difficult!

The question is, does capitalism reduce or increase these uncertainties?
We can suggest that capitalism adds two extra layers of uncertainty. As
with any economy, there is the uncertainty that produced goods will meet
an actual need of others (i.e., that it has a use-value). The market
adds another layer of uncertainty by adding the need for its price to
exceed costs a market. Finally, capitalism adds another level of
uncertainty in that the capitalist class must make suffice profits as
well. Thus, regardless of how much people need a specific good if
capitalists cannot make a profit from it then it will not be produced.

Uncertainty will, of course, afflict a communist-anarchist society.
Mistakes in resource allocation will happen, with some goods over
produced at times and under-produced at others. However, a communist
society removes the added uncertainty associated with a capitalist
economy as such mistakes do **not** lead to general slumps as losses
result in the failure of firms and rising unemployment. In other words,
without Mises' precise economic calculation society will no longer be
afflicted by the uncertainty associated with the profit system.

Significantly, there are developments within capitalism which point to
the benefits of communism in reducing uncertainty. This is the rise of
the large-scale corporation. In fact, many capitalist firms expand
precisely to reduce the uncertainties associated with market prices and
their (negative) impact on the plans they make. Thus companies integrate
horizontally by take-over to gain more control over investment and
supply decisions as well as vertically to stabilise costs and secure
demand for necessary inputs.

As economist John Kenneth Galbraith noted, when investment is large,
*"[n]o form of market uncertainty is so serious as that involving the
terms and conditions on which capital is obtained."* As a result
internal funds are used as *"the firm has a secure source of capital"*
and *"no longer faces the risks of the market."* This applies to other
inputs, for a *"firm cannot satisfactorily foresee and schedule future
action or prepare for contingencies if it does not know what its prices
will be, what its sales will be, what its costs, including labour and
capital costs, will be and what will be available at these costs. If the
market is uncontrolled, it will not know these things . . . Much of what
the firm regards as planning consists in minimising uncontrolled market
influences."* This partly explains why firms grow (the other reason is
to dominate the market and reap oligopolistic profits). The *"market is
superseded by vertical integration"* as the firm *"takes over the source
of supply or the outlet"*. This *"does not eliminate market
uncertainty"* but rather replaces *"the large and unmanageable
uncertainty as to the price"* of inputs with *"smaller, more diffuse and
more manageable uncertainties"* such as the costs of labour. A large
firm can only control the market, by *"reducing or eliminating the
independence of action"* of those it sells to or buys from. This means
the behaviour of others can be controlled, so that *"uncertainty as to
that behaviour is reduced."* Finally, advertising is used to influence
the amount sold. Firms also *"eliminate market uncertainty"* by
*"entering into contracts specifying prices and amounts to be provided
or bought for substantial periods of time."* Thus *"one of the
strategies of eliminating market uncertainty is to eliminate the
market."* [**The New Industrial State** p. 47, pp. 30-6 and p. 47]

Of course, such attempts to reduce uncertainty within capitalism are
incomplete and subject to breakdown. Such planning systems can come into
conflict with others (for example, the rise of Japanese corporations in
the 1970s and 1980s and subsequent decline of American industrial
power). They are centralised, hierarchically structured and based on
top-down central planning (and so subject to the informational problems
we highlighted in [section I.1.2](secI1.html#seci12)). Market forces can
reassert themselves, making a mockery of even the best organised plans.
However, these attempts at transcending the market within capitalism, as
incomplete as they are, show a major problem with relying on markets and
market prices to allocate resources. They add an extra layer of
uncertainty which ensure that investors and firms are as much in the
dark about their decisions as Mises argued central planners would be. As
such, to state as Mises does that production in socialism can *"never be
based upon the foundation of an exact calculation of value"* is somewhat
begging the question. [**Op. Cit.**, p. 109] This is because knowing the
*"exact"* price of an investment is meaningless as the key question is
whether it makes a profit or not -- and that is unknown when it is made
and if it makes a loss, it is still a waste of resources! So it does not
follow that a knowledge of current prices allows efficient allocation of
resources (assuming, of course, that profitability equates to social
usefulness).

In summary, Mises totally ignored the issues of uncertainty (we do not,
and cannot, know the future) and the collective impact of individual
decisions. Production and investment decisions are made based on
expectations about future profits, yet these (expected) profits depend
(in part) on what other decisions are being, and will be, made. This is
because they will affect the future aggregate supply of a good and so
market price, the price of inputs and the distribution of effective
demand. In the market-based (and so fragmented and atomistic)
decision-making Mises assumes, any production and investment decisions
are made on the basis on unavoidable ignorance of the actions of others
and the results of those actions. Of course there is uncertainty which
would affect every social system (such as the weather, discovery of new
sources of energy, raw materials and technology, changing customer
needs, and so forth). However, market based systems add extra levels of
uncertainty by the lack of communication between decision-makers as well
as making profit the be-all-and-end-all of economic rationalism.

So in terms of Mises' claim that only capitalism ensures that success
can be *"appraised in advance"*, it is clear that in reality that system
is as marked by *"groping in the dark"* as any other. What of the claim
that only markets can ensure that a project's success is *"later
retrospectively determined"*? By this, Mises makes a flawed assumption
-- namely the dubious notion that what is profitable is right. Thus
economically is identified with profitably. So even if we assume prices
provide enough information for rational decision making, that the
economy jumps from one state of equilibrium to another and that
capitalists can predict the future, the awkward fact is that maximising
profit does not equal maximising human well-being.

Neither well-being nor efficiency equals profitability as the latter
does not take into account **need**. Meeting needs is not
*"retrospectively determined"* under capitalism, only profit and loss.
An investment may fail not because it is not needed but because there is
no effective demand for it due to income inequalities. So it is
important to remember that the distribution of income determines whether
something is an "efficient" use of resources or not. As Thomas Balogh
noted, real income *"is measured in terms of a certain set of prices
ruling in a given period and that these prices will reflect the
prevailing distribution of income. (With no Texan oil millionaires here
would be little chance of selling a baby blue Roll-Royce . . . at a
price ten times the yearly income of a small farmer or sharecropper)."*
[**The Irrelevance of Conventional Economics**, pp. 98-9] The market
demand for commodities, which allocates resources between uses, is based
not on the tastes of consumers but on the distribution of purchasing
power between them. This, ironically, was mentioned by Mises as part of
his attack on socialism, arguing that the central planners could not use
current prices for *"the transition to socialism must, as a consequence
of the levelling out of the differences in income and the resultant
re-adjustments in consumption, and therefore production, change all
economic data."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 109] He did not mention the impact
this has in terms of "efficiency" or profitability! After all, what is
and is not profitable ("efficient") depends on effective demand, which
in turn depends of a specific income distribution. Identical production
processes become efficient and inefficient simply by a redistribution of
income from the rich to the poor, and vice versa. Similarly, changes in
market prices may make once profitably investments unprofitable, without
affecting the needs they were satisfying. And this, needless to say, can
have serious impacts on human well-being.

As discussed in [section C.1.5](secC1.html#secc15), this becomes most
obvious during famines. As Allan Engler points out, *"[w]hen people are
denied access to the means of livelihood, the invisible hand of market
forces does not intervene on their behalf. Equilibrium between supply
and demand has no necessary connection with human need. For example,
assume a country of one million people in which 900,000 are without
means of livelihood. One million bushels of wheat are produced. The
entire crop is sold to 100,000 people at \$10 a bushel. Supply and
demand are in equilibrium, yet 900 000 people will face starvation."*
[**Apostles of Greed**, pp. 50-51] In case anyone thinks that this just
happens in theory, the example of numerous famines (from the Irish
famine of the 1840s to those in African countries in 1980s) gives a
classic example of this occurring in practice, with rich landowners
exporting food to the other nations while millions starve in their own.

So the distributional consequences of the market system play havoc with
any attempt to define what is and is not an "efficient" use of
resources. As markets inform by 'exit' only -- some products find a
market, others do not -- 'voice' is absent. The operation of 'exit'
rather than 'voice' leaves behind those without power in the
marketplace. For example, the wealthy do not buy food poisoned with
additives, the poor consume it. This means a division grows between two
environments: one inhabited by those with wealth and one inhabited by
those without it. As can be seen from the current capitalist practice of
"exporting pollution" to developing countries, this problem can have
serious ecological and social effects. So, far from the market being a
*"democracy"* based on *"one dollar, one vote,"* it is an oligarchy in
which, for example, the *"79,000 Americans who earned the minimum wage
in 1987 have the same influence [or *"vote"*] as Michael Milken, who
'earned' as much as all of them combined."* [Michael Albert and Robin
Hahnel, **The Political Economy of Participatory Economics**, p. 21] One
dissident economist states the blindly obvious, namely that the *"market
and democracy clash at a fundamental level. Democracy runs on the
principle of 'one man (one person), one vote.' The market runs on the
principle of 'one dollar, one vote.' Naturally, the former gives equal
weight to each person, regardless of the money she/he has. The latter
gives greater weight to richer people."* This means that the market is
automatically skewed in favour of the wealthy and so *"[l]eaving
everything to the market means that the rich may be able to realise even
the most frivolous element of their desires, while the poor may not be
able even to survive -- thus the world spends twenty times more research
money on slimming drugs than on malaria, which claims more than a
million lives and debilitates millions more in developing countries
every year."* [Ha-Joon Chang, **Bad Samaritans**, p. 172 and p. 174]

In other words, markets are always biased in favour of effective demand,
i.e. in favour of the demands of people with money, and so can never
(except in the imaginary abstractions of neo-classical economics)
allocate the necessities of life to those who need them the most. Thus a
simple redistribution of wealth (via militant unions or the welfare
state, for example) could make previously "bad" investments good simply
because the new income allows those who had previously needed, but could
not afford, the good or service in question to purchase it. So just
because something makes a loss under one distribution of income does not
mean that it is an inefficient use of resources in the sense of meeting
human needs (and could make a profit under another, more equal,
distribution of wealth). So the "efficient" allocation of resources in
terms of price (i.e., profit) is often no such thing as the wealthy few
skews market decisions in their favour.

It is important to remember that, for the "Austrians", preferences are
demonstrated through action in the market and they are not interested in
opinions, thus any preference which is not expressed by action is
irrelevant to them. So any attempt to collectively prioritise, say,
building decent housing for all, provide health care for everyone,
abolish poverty, and so forth are all considered "inefficient" uses of
resources as those who receive them would not, normally, be able to
afford them and, consequently, do not really desire them anyway (as
they, needless to say, do not express that desire by market exchanges!).
Yet this ignores the awkward fact that in the market, people can only
act if they have money to make their preferences known. Thus those who
have a need but no money do not count when determining if the market is
efficient or not. There is simply no room for the real people who can be
harmed by real markets. As economist Amartya Sen argues, the workings of
a "pure" capitalist market, as desired by "Austrians" economists and
other propertarians, *"can be problematic since the actual consequences
of the operation of these entitlements can, quite possibly, include
rather terrible results. It can, in particular, lead to the violation of
the substantive freedom of individuals to achieve those things to which
they have reason to attach great importance, including escaping
avoidable morality, being well nourished and healthy, being able to
read, write and count and so on."* In fact, *"even gigantic famines can
result without anyone's [right] libertarian rights (including property
rights) being violated. The destitutes such as the unemployed or the
impoverished may starve precisely because their 'entitlements' . . . do
not give them enough food."* Similarly, *"deprivation"* such as
*"regular undernourishment"*, the *"lack of medical care for curable
illnesses"* can *"coexist with all [right] libertarian rights (including
rights of property ownership) being fully satisfied."* [**Development as
Freedom**, p. 66]

All of which, it must be stressed, is ignored in the "Austrian" case
against socialism. Ultimately, if providing food to a rich person's pets
makes a profit then it becomes a more economical and efficient use of
the resource than providing food to famine victims who cannot purchase
food on the market. So it should never be forgotten that the "Austrians"
insist that only preferences demonstrated in action are real. So if you
cannot act on the market (i.e., buy something) then your need for it is
not real. In other words, if a person loses their job and, as a
consequence, loses their home then, according to this logic, they do not
"need" a home as their "demonstrated preference" (i.e., their actual
choices in action) shows that they genuinely value living under a bridge
(assuming they gain the bridge owners agreement, of course).

As an aside, this obvious fact shows that the "Austrian" assertion that
intervention in the market **always** reduces social utility cannot be
supported. The argument that the market maximises utility is based on
assuming a given allocation of resources before the process of free
exchange begins. If someone does not have sufficient income to, say, buy
food or essential medical treatment then this is not reflected in the
market. If wealth is redistributed and they then they get access to the
goods in question, then (obviously) their utility has increased and it
is a moot point whether social utility has decreased as the disutility
of the millionaire who was taxed to achieve it cannot be compared to it.
Significantly, those "Austrians" who have sought to prove that all
intervention in the market reduces social utility have failed. For
example, as one dissident "Austrian" economist notes, while Murray
Rothbard *"claimed he offered a purely deductive"* argument that state
intervention always reduced social utility *"his case [was] logically
flawed."* He simply assumed that social utility was reduced although he
gave no reason for such an assumption as he admitted that interpersonal
comparisons of utility were impossible. For someone *"who asks that his
claims be tested only by their logic"*, his ultimate conclusions about
state intervention *"do not follow"* and exhibit *"a careless
self-contradiction"* [David L. Prychitko, **Markets, Planning and
Democracy**, p. 189, p. 111 and p. 110]

In summary, then, in terms of feedback saying that if something made a
profit then it was efficiently produced confuses efficiency and need
with profitability and effective demand. Something can make a profit by
imposing costs via externalities and lowering quality. Equally, a good
may not make a profit in spite of there being a need for it simply
because people cannot afford to pay for it.

As such, Mises was wrong to assert that *"[b]etween production for
profit and production for need, there is no contrast."* [**Socialism**,
p. 143] In fact, it seems incredible that anyone claiming to be an
economist could make such a comment. As Proudhon and Marx (like Smith
and Ricardo before them) made clear, a commodity in order to be
exchanged must first have a use-value (utility) to others. Thus
production for profit, by definition, means production for "use" --
otherwise exchange would not happen. What socialists were highlighting
by contrasting production for profit to need was, firstly, that need
comes after profit and so without profit a good will not be produced no
matter how many people need it. Secondly, it highlights the fact that
during crises capitalism is marked by an over-production of goods
reducing profits, so stopping production, while people who need those
goods go without them. Thus capitalism is marked by homeless people
living next to empty housing and hungry people seeing food exported or
destroyed in order to maximise profit. Ultimately, if the capitalist
does not make a profit then it is a bad investment -- regardless of
whether it could be used to meet people's needs and so make their lives
better. In other words, Mises ignores the very basis of capitalism
(production for profit) and depicts it as production aiming at the
direct satisfaction of consumers.

Equally, that something makes a profit does not mean that it is an
efficient use of resources. If, for example, that profit is achieved by
imposing pollution externalities or by market power then it cannot be
said that society as a whole, rather than the capitalists, have
benefited. Similarly, non-market based systems can be seen to be more
efficient than market based ones in terms of outcome. For example,
making health care available to all who need it rather than those who
can afford it is economically "inefficient" in "Austrian" eyes but only
an ideologue would claim that we should not do so because of this
particularly as we can point to the awkward fact that the more
privatised health care systems in the USA and Chile are more inefficient
than the nationalised systems elsewhere in the world. Administration
costs are higher and the societies in question pay far more for an
equivalent level of treatment. Of course, it could be argued that the
privatised systems are not truly private but the awkward fact remains --
the more market based system is worse, in terms of coverage of the
population, cost for treatment, bureaucracy and health outcomes per
pound spent.

In addition, in a highly unequal society costs are externalised to those
at the bottom of the social hierarchy. The consequences are harmful, as
suggested by the newspeak used to disguise this reality. For example,
there is what is called "increasing flexibility of the labour market."
"Flexibility" sounds great: rigid structures are unappealing and hardly
suitable for human growth. In reality, as Noam Chomsky points out
*"[f]lexibility means insecurity. It means you go to bed at night and
don't know if you have a job tomorrow morning. That's called flexibility
of the labour market, and any economist can explain that's a good thing
for the economy, where by 'the economy' now we understand profit-making.
We don't mean by 'the economy' the way people live. That's good for the
economy, and temporary jobs increase flexibility. Low wages also
increase job insecurity. They keep inflation low. That's good for people
who have money, say, bondholders. So these all contribute to what's
called a 'healthy economy,' meaning one with very high profits. Profits
are doing fine. Corporate profits are zooming. But for most of the
population, very grim circumstances. And grim circumstances, without
much prospect of a future, may lead to constructive social action, but
where that's lacking they express themselves in violence."* [**Keeping
the Rabble in Line**, pp. 283-4] So it simply cannot be assumed that
what is good for the economy (profits) equates to what to good for
people (at least the working class).

Thus the "Austrians" prizes profitability above all and this assumption
is at the root of the "Calculation Argument" against socialism, but this
only makes sense only insofar as efficiency is confused with profit. The
market will invest in coal if profits are higher and, in so doing,
contribute to global warming. It will deny medical care to the sick (no
profits and so it is inefficient) while contributing to, say, a housing
bubble because it makes short-term profits by providing loans to people
who really cannot afford it. It will support all kinds of economic
activity, regardless of the wider impact, and so "efficiency" (i.e.,
profits) can, and does, contradict both wisdom and ethics and so,
ultimately, an efficient allocation of resources to meet people's needs.

Lastly, our critique has so far ignored the periodic crises that hit
capitalist economies which produce massive unemployment and social
disruption -- crises that are due to subjective and objective pressures
on the operation of the price mechanism (see [section C.7](secC7.html)
for details). In the upswing, when expectations are buoyant, firms will
invest and produce a mutually reinforcing expansion. However, the net
effect of such decisions eventually leads to over-investment, excess
capacity and over-production -- mal-investment and the waste of the
embodied resources. This leads to lower than expected profits,
expectations change for the worse and the boom turns into bust, capital
equipment is scrapped, workers are unemployed and resources are either
wasted or left idle.

In a crisis we see the contradiction between use value and exchange
value come to a head. Workers are no less productive than when the
crisis started, the goods and services they create are no less needed
than before. The means of production are just productive as they were.
Both are just as capable as before of affording for everyone a decent
standard of living. Even though people are homeless, housing stands
empty. Even though people need goods, production is stopped. Even though
people want jobs, workplaces are closed. Yet, according to the logic of
*"exact"* "economic calculation", production is now "inefficient" and
should be closed-down, workers made unemployed and expected to find work
by forcing down the wages of those lucky enough to remain employed in
the hope that the owners of the means of life will find it profitable to
exploit them as much as before (for when hard times arrive it is never
long until somebody suggests that the return of prosperity requires
sacrifices at the bottom of the heap and, needless to say, the
"Austrian" economists are usually the first to do so).

This suggests that the efficient allocation of resources becomes
meaningless if its reality is a cycle where consumers go without
essential goods due to scarcity and high prices followed by businesses
going bust because of over-production and low prices. This process ruins
large numbers of people's lives, not to mention wasting vast stocks of
productive equipment and goods. There are always people who need the
over-produced goods and so the market adds to uncertainty as there is a
difference between the over-production of goods and the over-production
of commodities. If more goods were produced in a communist society this
may signify a waste of resources but it would not, as under capitalism,
produce a crisis situation as well!

So in a real capitalist economy, there are numerous reasons for
apparently rational investment decisions going wrong. Not that these
investments produce goods which people do not need, simply that
*"exact"* "economic calculation" indicates that they are not making a
profit and so are an "inefficient" use of resources. However, it is
question begging in the extreme to argue that if (thanks to a recession)
workers can no longer buy food then is it an "efficient" allocation of
resources that they starve. Similarly, during the Great Depression, the
American government (under the New Deal) hired about 60% of the
unemployed in public works and conservation projects. These saw a
billion trees planted, the whooping crane saved, the modernisation of
rural America, and the building of (among others) the Cathedral of
Learning in Pittsburgh, the Montana state capitol, New York's Lincoln
Tunnel and Triborough Bridge complex, the Tennessee Valley Authority as
well as building or renovating 2,500 hospitals, 45,000 schools, 13,000
parks and playgrounds, 7,800 bridges, 700,000 miles of roads, 1,000
airfields as well as employing 50,000 teachers and rebuilding the
country's entire rural school system. Can all these schemes really be
considered a waste of resources simply because they would never have
made a capitalist a profit?

Of course, our discussion is affected by the fact that "actually
existing" capitalism has various forms of state-intervention. Some of
these "socialise" costs and risks, such as publicly funded creation of
an infrastructure and Research and Development (R&D). Given that much
R&D is conducted via state funding (via universities, military
procurements, and so on) and (of course!) the profits of such research
are then privatised, question arises would the initial research have
gone ahead if the costs had not been "socialised"? Would Mises'
*"exact"* calculation have resulted in, say, the internet being
developed? If, as seems likely, not, does not mean our current use of
the World Wide Web is an inefficient use of resources? Then there are
the numerous state interventions which exist to ensure that certain
activities become "efficient" (i.e., profitable) such as specifying and
defending intellectual property rights, the limited liability of
corporations and enforcing capitalist property rights (in land, for
example). While we take this activity for granted when evaluating
capitalism, they are serious imperfections in the market and so what
counts as an "efficient" use of resources. Other state interventions aim
to reduce uncertainty and stabilise the market, such as welfare
maintaining aggregate demand.

Removing these "imperfections" in the market would substantially affect
the persuasiveness of Mises' case. *"What data we do have,"* notes Doug
Henwood, *"don't lend any support to the notion that the nineteenth
century was more 'stable' than the twentieth . . . the price level
bounced all over the place, with periods of inflation alternating with
periods of deflation, and GDP growth in the last three decades . . . was
similarly volatile. The busts were savage, resulting in massive bank
failures and very lean times for workers and farmers."* [**After the New
Economy**, p. 242] Looking at business cycle data for America, what
becomes clear is that some of those regular nineteenth century slumps
were extremely long: the Panic of 1873, for example, was followed by a
recession that lasted 5 1/2 years. The New York Stock Exchange closed
for ten days and 89 of the country's 364 railroads went bankrupt. A
total of 18,000 businesses failed between 1873 and 1875. Unemployment
reached 14% by 1876, during a time which became known as the Long
Depression. Construction work lagged, wages were cut, real estate values
fell and corporate profits vanished.

Given this, given the tendency of capitalism to crisis and to ignore
real needs in favour of effective demand, it is far better to be roughly
right than precisely wrong. In other words, the economic calculation
that Mises celebrates regularly leads to situations where people suffer
because it precisely shows that workplaces should shut because, although
nothing had changed in their productivity and the need of their
products, they can no longer make a profit. Saying, in the middle of a
crisis, that people should be without work, be homeless and go hungry
because economic calculation proves they have no need for employment,
homes and food shows the irrationality of glorifying "economic
calculation" as the be all and end all of resource allocation.

In summary, then, not only is libertarian communism possible, capitalism
itself makes economic calculation problematic and resource allocation
inefficient. Given the systematic uncertainty which market dynamics
imply and the tendencies to crisis inherent in the system, "economic
calculation" ensures that resources are wasted. Using the profit
criteria as the measure of "efficiency" is also problematic as it
ensures that real needs are ignored and places society in frequent
situations (crises) where "economic calculation" ensures that industries
close, so ensuring that goods and services people need are no longer
produced. As Proudhon put it, under capitalism there is *"a miserable
oscillation between usury and bankruptcy."* [**Proudhon's Solution of
the Social Problem**, p. 63] For anarchists, these drawbacks to
capitalist allocation are obvious. Equally obvious is the reason why
Mises failed to discuss them: ultimately, like neo-classical economics,
the "Austrian" school seeks to eulogise capitalism rather than to
understand it.
