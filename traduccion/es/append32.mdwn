Marxists and Spanish Anarchism
==============================

In this appendix of our FAQ we discuss and reply to various analyses of
Spanish anarchism put forward by Marxists, particularly
Marxist-Leninists of various shades. The history and politics of Spanish
Anarchism is not well known in many circles, particularly Marxist ones,
and the various misrepresentations and distortions that Marxists have
spread about that history and politics are many. This appendix is an
attempt to put the record straight with regards the Spanish Anarchist
movement and point out the errors associated with the standard Marxist
accounts of that movement, its politics and its history.

Hopefully this appendix will go some way towards making Marxists (and
others) investigate the actual facts of anarchism and Spanish anarchist
history rather than depending on inaccurate secondary material (usually
written by their comrades).

Part of this essay is based on the article *"Trotskyist Lies on
Anarchism"* which appeared in **Black Flag** issue no. 211 and Tom
Wetzel's article **Workers' Power and the Spanish Revolution**.

1. Were the Spanish Anarchists *"Primitive Rebels"*?
----------------------------------------------------

The thesis that the Spanish Anarchists were *"primitive rebels,"* with a
primitive understanding of the nature of revolution is a common one
amongst Marxists. One of the main sources for this kind of argument is
Eric Hobsbawm's **Primitive Rebels**, who was a member of the British
Communist Party at the time. While the obvious Stalinist nature of the
author may be thought enough to alert the intelligent of its political
biases, its basic thesis is repeated by many Marxists.

Before discussing Hobsbawm in more detail, it would be useful to refute
some of the more silly things so-called serious historians have asserted
about Spanish Anarchism. Indeed, it would be hard to find another social
or political movement which has been more misrepresented or its ideas
and activities so distorted by historians whose attitudes seem more
supported by ideological conviction rather than history or investigation
of social life.

One of the most common descriptions of Spanish anarchism is that it was
*"religious"* or *"millenarium"* in nature. Hobsbawm himself accepts
this conceptualisation, along with historians and commentators like
Gerald Brenan and Franz Brokenau (who, in fact, did state *"Anarchism
**is** a religious movement"*). Such use of religion was largely due to
the influence of Juan Diaz del Moral, a lawyer and historian who was
also a landowner. As Jerome R. Mintz points out, *"according to Diaz del
Moral, the moral and passionate obreros conscientes [conscious workers
-- i.e. workers who considered themselves to be anarchists] absorbed in
their pamphlets and newspapers were akin to frenzied believers in a new
religion."* [**The Anarchists of Casas Viejas**, p. 5f] However, such a
perspective was formed by his class position and privileges which could
not help but reflect them:

> *"Diaz del Moral ascribed to the campesinos [of Andalusia] racial and
> cultural stereotypes that were common saws of his class. The sole
> cause for the waves of rural unrest, Diaz del Moral asserted, could be
> found in the psychology of the campesinos . . . He believed that the
> Andalusian field workers had inherited a Moorish tendency toward
> ecstasy and millenarianism that accounted for their attraction to
> anarchist teaching. Diaz del Moral was mystified by expressions of
> animosity directed toward him, but the workers considered him to be a
> senorito, a landowner who does not labour . . . Although he was both
> scholarly and sympathetic, Diaz del Moral could not comprehend the
> hunger and the desperation of the campesinos around him . . . To Diaz
> del Moral, campesino ignorance, passion, ecstasy, illusion, and
> depression, not having a legitimate basis in reality, could be found
> only in the roots of their racial heritage."* [**Op. Cit.**, pp. 5-6]

Hence the *"religious"* nature of anarchism -- it was one of the ways an
uncomprehending member of the middle-class could explain working class
discontent and rebellion. Unfortunately, this "explanation" has become
common place in history books (partly reflected academics class interest
too and lack of understanding of working class interests, needs and
hopes).

As Mintz argues, *"at first glance the religious model seems to make
anarchism easier to understand, particularly in the absence of detailed
observation and intimate contact. The model was, however, also used to
serve the political ends of anarchism's opponents. Here the use of the
terms 'religious' and 'millenarium' stamp anarchist goals as unrealistic
and unattainable. Anarchism is thus dismissed as a viable solution to
social ills."* He continues by arguing that the *"oversimplifications
posited became serious distortions of anarchist belief and practice"*
(as we shall see). [**Op. Cit.**, p. 5 and p. 6]

Temma Kaplan's critique of the *"religious"* view is also worth
mentioning. She argues that *"the millenarium theory is too mechanistic
to explain the complex pattern of Andalusian anarchist activity. The
millenarian argument, in portraying the Andalusian anarchists as
fundamentally religious, overlooks their clear comprehension of the
social sources of their oppression."* She concludes that *"the degree of
organisation, not the religiosity of workers and the community, accounts
for mass mobilisations carried on by the Andalusian anarchists at the
end of the nineteenth century."* She also notes that the *"[i]n a
secular age, the taint of religion is the taint of irrationality."*
[**Anarchists of Andalusia: 1868-1903**, pp. 210-12 and p. 211] Thus,
the Andalusian anarchists had a clear idea who their enemies were,
namely the ruling class of the region. She also points out that, for all
their revolutionary elan, the anarchists developed a rational strategy
of revolution, channelling their energies into organising a trade union
movement that could be used as a vehicle for social and economic change.
Moreover, as well as a clear idea of how to change society they had a
clear vision of what sort of society they desired -- one built around
collective ownership and federations of workers' associations and
communes.

Therefore the idea that anarchism can be explained in *"religious"*
terms is fundamentally flawed. It basically assumes that the Spanish
workers were fundamentally irrational, unable to comprehend the sources
of their unhappiness nor able to define their own political goals and
tactics and instead looked to naive theories which reinforced their
irrationalities. In actuality, like most people, they were sensible,
intelligent human beings who believed in a better life and were willing
to apply their ideas in their everyday life. That historians apply
patronising attitudes towards them says more about the historians than
the campesinos.

This uncomprehending attitude to historians can be seen from some of the
more strange assertions they make against the Spanish Anarchists. Gerald
Brenan, Eric Hobsbawm and Raymond Carr, for example, all maintained that
there was a connection between anarchist strikes and sexual practices.
Carr's description gives a flavour:

> *"Austere puritans, they sought to impose vegetarianism, sexual
> abstinence, and atheism on one of the most backward peasantries of
> Europe . . . Thus strikes were moments of exaltation as well as
> demands for better conditions; spontaneous and often disconnected they
> would bring, not only the abolition of piece-work, but 'the day,' so
> near at hand that sexual intercourse and alcohol were abandoned by
> enthusiasts till it should dawn."* [**Spain: 1808-1975**, p. 444]

Mintz, an American anthropologist who actually stayed with the
campesino's for a number of years after 1965, actually asked them about
such claims. As he put it, the *"level-headed anarchists were astonished
by such descriptions of supposed Spanish puritanism by over-enthusiastic
historians."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 6] As one anarchist put it, *"[o]f
course, without any work the husband couldn't provide any food at
dinnertime, and so they were angry at each other, and she wouldn't have
anything to do with him. In that sense, yes, there were no sexual
relations."* [quoted, **Op. Cit.**, p. 7]

Mintz traces the citations which allowed the historians to arrive at
such ridiculous views to a French social historian, Angel Maraud, who
observed that during the general strike of 1902 in Moron, marriages were
postponed to after the promised division of the lands. As Mintz points
out, *"as a Frenchman, Maraud undoubtedly assumed that everyone knew a
formal wedding ceremony did not necessarily govern the sexual relations
of courting couples."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 6f]

As for abstinence and puritanism, nothing could be further from the
truth. As Mintz argues, the anarchists considered alcoholism as being
*"responsible for much of the social malaise among many workers . . .
Excessive drinking robbed the worker of his senses and deprived his
family of food. Anarchist newspapers and pamphlets hammered out the evil
of this vice."* However, *"[p]roscriptions were not of a puritanical
order"* (and so there was no desire to "impose" such things on people)
and quotes an anarchist who stated that *"coffee and tobacco were not
prohibited, but one was advised against using them. Men were warned
against going to a brothel. It was not a matter of morality but of
hygiene."* As for vegetarianism, it *"attracted few adherents, even
among the **obreros conscientes**."* [**Op. Cit.**, pp. 86-7 and p. 88]

Moreover, academic mockery of anarchist attempts to combat alcoholism
(and **not** alcohol as such) forgets the social context. Being
academics they may not have experienced wage labour directly and so do
not realise the misery it can cause. People turn to drink simply because
their jobs are so bad and seek escape from the drudgery of their
everyday lives. As Bakunin argued, *"confined in their life like a
prisoner in his prison, without horizon, without outlet . . . the people
would have the singularly narrow souls and blunted instincts of the
bourgeois if they did not feel a desire to escape; but of escape there
are but three methods -- two chimerical and a third real. The first two
are the dram-shop and the church, debauchery of the body or debauchery
of the mind; the third is social revolution."* [**God and the State**,
p. 16] So to combat alcoholism was particularly important as many
workers turned to alcohol as a means of escaping the misery of life
under capitalism. Thus Bookchin:

> *"[T]o abstain from smoking, to live by high moral standards, and to
> especially adjure the consumption of alcohol was very important at the
> time. Spain was going through her own belated industrial revolution
> during the period of anarchist ascendancy with all its demoralising
> features. The collapse of morale among the proletariat, with rampant
> drunkenness, venereal disease, and the collapse of sanitary
> facilities, was the foremost problem which Spanish revolutionaries had
> to deal with . . . On this score, the Spanish anarchists were
> eminently successful. Few CNT workers, much less a committed
> anarchist, would have dared show up drunk at meetings or misbehave
> overtly with their comrades. If one considers the terrible working and
> living conditions of the period, alcoholism was not as serious a
> problem in Spain as it was in England during the industrial
> revolution."* [*"Introductory Essay"*, **The Anarchist Collectives**,
> Sam Dolgoff (ed.), pp. xix-xxf]

Mintz sums up by stating *"[c]ontrary to exaggerated accounts of
anarchist zeal, most thoughtful **obreros conscientes** believed in
moderation, not abstinence."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 88] Unfortunately
Mintz's work, the product of years of living with and talking to the
people actually involved in the movement, does not seem to have made
much impact on the historians. Unsurprising, really, as history is
rarely about the actions, ideas and hopes of working people.

As can be seen, historians seem to delight in misrepresenting the ideas
and actions of the Spanish Anarchists. Sometimes, as just seen, the
distortions are quite serious, extremely misleading and ensure that
anarchism cannot be understood or viewed as a serious political theory
(we can understand why Marxists historians would seek this). Sometimes
they can be subtle as when Ronald Fraser states that at the CNT's
Saragossa congress in 1936 *"the proposal to create a libertarian
militia to crush a military uprising was rejected almost scornfully, in
the name of traditional anti-militarism."* [**Blood of Spain**, p. 101]
Hugh Thomas makes the same claim, stating at *"there was no sign that
anyone [at the congress] realised that there was a danger of fascism;
and no agreement, in consequence, on the arming of militias, much less
the organisation of a revolutionary army as suggested by Juan Garcia
Oliver."* [**The Spanish Civil War**, p. 181]

However, what Fraser and Thomas omit to tell the reader is that this
motion *"was defeated by one favouring the idea of guerrilla warfare."*
[Peter Marshal, **Demanding the Impossible**, p. 460] The Saragossa
resolution itself stated that a *"permanent army constitutes the
greatest danger for the revolution . . . The armed people will be the
best guarantee against all attempts to restore the destroyed regime by
interior or exterior forces . . . Each Commune should have its arms and
elements of defence."* [quoted by Robert Alexander, **The Anarchists in
the Spanish Civil War**, vol. 1, p. 64]

Fraser's and Hugh's omission is extremely serious -- it gives a
radically false impression of anarchist politics. Their comments could
led a reader to think that anarchists, as Marxists claim, do not believe
in defending a revolution. As can be seen from the actual resolutions of
the Saragossa conference, this is not the case. Indeed, given that the
congress was explicitly discussing, along with many other issues, the
question of *"defence of the revolution"* their omission seriously
distorts the CNT's position and anarchist theory. As seen, the congress
supported the need to arm the people and to keep those arms under the
control of the communes (as well as the role of *"Confederal Defence
Forces"* and the efficient organisation of forces on a national level).
Given that Thomas quotes extensively from the Saragossa resolution on
libertarian communism we can only surmise that he forgot to read the
section entitled ***"Defence of the Revolution."***

Hugh and Thomas omissions, however, ensure that anarchism is presented
as an utopian and naive theory, unaware of the problems facing society.
In reality, the opposite is the case -- the Spanish anarchists were well
aware of the need to arm the people and resist counter-revolution and
fascism by force. Regardless of Thomas' claims, it is clear that the CNT
and FAI realised the danger of fascism existed and passed appropriate
resolutions outlining how to organise an effective means of self-defence
(indeed, as early as February 14 of that year, the CNT had issued a
prophetic manifesto warning that right-wing elements were ready to
provoke a military coup [Murray Bookchin, **The Spanish Anarchists**, p.
273]). To state otherwise, while quoting from the document that
discusses the issue, must be considered a deliberate lie.

However, to return to our main point -- Eric Hobsbawm's thesis that the
Spanish anarchists were an example of *"pre-political"* groups -- the
*"primitive rebels"* of his title.

Essentially, Hobsbawm describes the Spanish Anarchists -- particularly
the Andalusian anarchists -- as modern-day secular mystics who, like the
millenarians of the Middle Ages, were guided by the irrational belief
that it was possible to will profound social change. The actions of the
Spanish anarchist movement, therefore, can be explained in terms of
millenarian behaviour -- the belief that it was able to jump start to
utopia via an act of will.

The Spanish farm and industrial workers, it is argued, were unable to
grasp the complexities of the economic and political structures that
dominated their lives and so were attracted to anarchism. According to
Hobsbawm, anarchism is marked by *"theoretical primitivism"* and a
primitive understanding of revolution and this explained why anarchism
was popular with Spanish workers, particularly farm workers. According
to Hobsbawm, anarchism told the workers that by spontaneously rising up
together they could overthrow the forces of repression and create the
new millennium.

Obviously, we cannot refute Hobsbawm's claims of anarchism's
*"theoretical primitivism"* in this appendix, the reader is invited to
consult the main FAQ. Moreover, we cannot stress more that Hobsbawm's
assertion that anarchists believe in spontaneous, overnight uprisings is
false. Rather, we see revolution as a **process** in which day-to-day
struggle and organisation play a key role -- it is not seen as occurring
independently of the on-going class struggle or social evolution. While
we discuss in depth the nature of an anarchist social revolution in
[section J.7](secJ7.html), we can present a few quotes by Bakunin to
refute Hobsbawm's claim:

> *"Revolutions are not improvised. They are not made at will by
> individuals. They come about through the force of circumstances and
> are independent of any deliberate ill or conspiracy."* [quoted by
> Brian Morris, **Bakunin: The Philosophy of Freedom**, p. 139]
>
> *"It is impossible to rouse people by artificial means. Popular
> revolutions are born by the actual force of events . . . It is
> impossible to bring about such a revolution artificially. It is not
> even possible to speed it up at all significantly . . . There are some
> periods in history when revolutions are quite simply impossible; there
> are other periods when they are inevitable."* [**Michael Bakunin:
> Selected Writings**, p. 183]

As Brian Morris correctly argues, *"Bakunin denies that a social
revolution could be made by the will of individuals, independent of
social and economic circumstances. He was much less a voluntarist than
his Marxist critics make out . . . he was . . . aware that the social
revolution would be a long process that may take many years for its
realisation."* [**Bakunin: The Philosophy of Freedom**, pp. 138-9] To
aid the process of social revolution, Bakunin supported the need for
*"pioneering groups or associations of advanced workers who were willing
to initiate this great movement of self-emancipation."* However, more is
needed -- namely popular working class organisations -- *"what is the
organisation of the masses? . . . It is the organisation by professions
and trades . . . The organisation of the trade sections . . . bear in
themselves the living seed of the new society which is to replace the
old world. They are creating not only the ideas but also the facts of
the future itself."* [**Bakunin on Anarchism**, p. 252 and p. 255]

Therefore, Bakunin saw revolution as a process which starts with
day-to-day struggle and creation of labour unions to organise that
struggle. As he put it himself:

> *"What policy should the International [Workers' Association] follow
> during th[e] somewhat extended time period that separates us from this
> terrible social revolution . . . the International will give labour
> unrest in all countries an **essentially economic** character, with
> the aim of reducing working hours and increasing salary, by means of
> the **association of the working masses** . . . It will [also]
> propagandise its principles . . . Lastly, the International will
> expand and organise across frontiers of all countries, so that when
> the revolution -- brought about by the force of circumstances --
> breaks out, the International will be a real force and will know what
> it has to do. Then it will be able to take the revolution into its own
> hands and give it a direction that will benefit the people: an earnest
> international organisation of workers' associations from all
> countries, capable of replacing this departing world of States and
> bourgeoisie."* [**The Basic Bakunin**, pp. 109-10]

However, while quoting Bakunin refutes part of his thesis, Hobsbawm does
base his case on some actual events of Spanish Anarchist history.
Therefore we need to look at these cases and show how he gets these
wrong. Without an empirical basis, his case obviously falls even without
quotes by Bakunin. Luckily the important examples he uses have been
analysed by people without the ideological blinkers inherent in
Leninism.

While we shall concentrate on just two cases -- Casa Viejas in 1933 and
the Jerez rising of 1892 -- a few general points should be mentioned. As
Jerome Mintz notes, Hobsbawms' *"account is based primarily on a
preconceived evolutionary model of political development rather than on
data gathered in field research. The model scales labour movements in
accord with their progress toward mass parties and central authority. In
short, he explains how anarchosyndicalists were presumed to act rather
than what actually took place, and the uprising at Casa Viejas was used
to prove an already established point of view. Unfortunately, his
evolutionary model misled him on virtually every point."* [**Op. Cit.**,
p. 271] We should also note his "model" is essentially Marxist ideology
-- namely, Marx's assertion that his aim for mass political parties
expressed the interests of the working class and all other visions were
the products of sectarians. Mintz also points out that Hobsbawm does not
live up to his own model:

> *"While Hobsbawm's theoretical model is evolutionary, in his own
> treatment anarchism is often regarded as unchanging from one decade to
> the other. In his text, attitudes and beliefs of 1903-5, 1918-20,
> 1933, and 1936 are lumped together or considered interchangeable. Of
> course during these decades the anarchosyndicalists had developed
> their programs and the individuals involved had become more
> experienced."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 271f]

Hobsbawm believed that Casas Viejas was the classic *"anarchist"*
uprising -- *"utopian, millenarian, apocalyptic, as all witnesses agree
it to have been."* [**Primitive Rebels**, p. 90] As Mintz states, *"the
facts prove otherwise. Casas Viejas rose not in a frenzy of blind
millenarianism but in response to a call for a nation-wide revolutionary
strike. The insurrection of January 1933 was hatched by faistas [members
of the FAI] in Barcelona and was to be fought primarily there and in
other urban centres. The uprisings in the countryside would be
diversionary and designed to keep the civil guard from shifting
reinforcements. The faista plot was then fed by intensive newspaper
propaganda, by travelling orators, and by actions undertaken by the
[CNT] defence committees. Representatives of the defence committees from
Casas Viejas and Medina had received instructions at a regional meeting
held days before. On January 11, the anarchosyndicalists of Casas Viejas
believed that they were joining their companeros who had already been at
the barricades since January 8."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 272]

Hobsbawm argued that the uprising occurred in accordance with an
established economic pattern:

> *"Economic conditions naturally determined the timing and periodicity
> of the revolutionary outbreaks -- for instance, social movements
> tended to reach a peak intensity during the worse months of the year
> -- January to March, when farm labourers have least work (the march on
> Jerez in 1892 and the rising of Casas Viejas in 1933 both occurred
> early in January), March-July, when the proceeding harvest has been
> exhausted and times are lean."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 79]

Mintz states the obvious:

> *"In reality, most agricultural strikes took place in May and June,
> the period of the harvest and the only time of the year when the
> campesinos had any leverage against the landowners. The uprising at
> Casas Viejas occurred in January precisely because it was **not** an
> agricultural strike. The timing of the insurrection, hurriedly called
> to coincide with a planned railway strike that would make it difficult
> for the government to shift its forces, was determined by strategic
> rather than economic considerations."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 273]

As for the revolt itself, Hobsbawm asserts that:

> *"Secure from the outside world, [the men] put up the red and black
> flag of anarchy and set about dividing the land. They made no attempt
> to spread the movement or kill anyone."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 274]

Which, as Mintz clearly shows, was nonsense:

> *"As is already evident, rather than securing themselves from the rest
> of world, the uprising at Casas Viejas was a pathetic attempt to join
> in an ill-fated national insurrection. With regard to his second
> point, there was neither the time nor the opportunity to 'set about
> dividing the land.' The men were scattered in various locations
> guarding roads and paths leading to the town. There were no meetings
> or discussions during this brief period of control. Only a few hours
> separated the shooting at the barracks and the entrance of the small
> [government] rescue force from Alcala. Contrary to Hobsbawm's
> description of peaceful enterprise, at the outset the anarchists
> surrounding the barracks had fired on the civil guards, mortally
> wounding two men."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 274]

As can be seen, Hobsbawm was totally wrong about the uprising itself and
so it cannot be used as evidence for his thesis. On other, less key
issues, he was equally wrong. Mintz gives an excellent summary:

> *"Since kinship is a key feature in 'primitive' societies, according
> to Hobsbawm, it was a major factor in the leadership of the sindicato
> [union] in Casas Viejas.*
>
> "There is no evidence that kinship had anything to do with leadership
> in the anarchist movement in Casa Viejas or anywhere else. The reverse
> would be closer to the truth. Since the anarchists expressed belief in
> universal brotherhood, kinship ties were often undermined. In times of
> strike or in carrying out any decision of the collective membership,
> obreros conscientes sometimes had to act counter to their kinship
> demands in order to keep faith with the movement and with their
> companeros.
>
> "Hobsbawm's specific examples are unfortunately based in part on
> errors of fact. . .
>
> "Hobsbawm's model [also] requires a charismatic leader. Accordingly,

>
> "This celebration of Seisdedo's role ['Six Fingers'], however, ignores
> the unanimous view of townspeople of every class and political
> persuasion, who assert that the old man was apolitical and had nothing

> "Should the role of charismatic leader be given to someone else in the

> characters there is no sign of charismatic leadership . . ." [**Op.
> Cit.**, pp. 274-6]

Mintz sums up by stating *"Hobsbawm's adherence to a model, and the
accumulation of misinformation, led him away from the essential
conflicts underlying the tragedy and from the reality of the people who
participated in it."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 276]

The Jerez uprising of 1892 also fails to provide Hobsbawm with any
empirical evidence to support his claims. Indeed, as in Casas Viejas,
the evidence actually works against him. The actual events of the
uprising are as follows. Just before midnight of 8th January 1892,
several hundred workers entered the town of Jerez crying *"Long live the
revolution! Long live Anarchy!"* Armed with only rocks, sticks, scythes
and other farm equipment, they marched toward the city jail with the
evident intention of releasing its prisoners -- who included many
political prisoners, victims of the government's recent anti-anarchist
campaign. A few people were killed and the uprising dispersed by a
regiment of mounted troops.

Hobsbawm claims this revolt as evidence for his *"primitive rebels"*
thesis. As historian George R. Esenwein argues:

> *"[T]he Jerez incident cannot be explained in terms of this model.
> What the millenarian view fails to do in this instance is to credit
> the workers with the ability to define their own political goals. This
> is not to deny that there were millenarian aspects of the rising, for
> the mob action of the workers on the night of 8 January indicates a
> degree of irrationalism that is consistent with millenarian behaviour.
> But . . . the agitators seem to have had a clear motive in mind when
> they rose: they sought to release their comrades from the local jail
> and thereby demonstrate their defiance of the government's incessant
> persecution of the International [Workers' Association] movement.
> However clumsily and crudely they expressed their grievance, the
> workers were patently aiming to achieve this objective and not to
> overthrow the local government in order to inaugurate the birth of a
> libertarian society."* [**Anarchist Ideology and the Working Class
> Movement in Spain: 1868-1898**, p. 184]

Similarly, many Marxists (and liberal historians) point to the *"cycle
of insurrections"* that occurred during the 1930s. They usually portray
these revolts as isolated insurrections organised by the FAI who
appeared in villages and proclaimed libertarian communism. The picture
is one of disorganisation, millenarianism and a believe in spontaneous
revolution inspired by a few militants and their daring actions. Nothing
could be further from the truth. The *"cycle of insurrections"* was far
more complex that this, as Juan Gomez Casas makes clear:

> *"Between 1932 and 1934 . . . the Spanish anarchists tried to destroy
> the existing social order through a series of increasingly violent
> strikes and insurrections, which were at first spontaneous, later
> co-ordinated."* [**Anarchist Organisation: The History of the FAI**,
> p. 135]

Stuart Christie stresses this point when he wrote *"[i]t has been widely
assumed that the cycle of insurrections which began in . . . January
1933 were organised and instigated by the FAI . . . In fact the rising
had nothing to do with the FAI. It began as an entirely spontaneous
local affair directed against a local employer, but quickly mushroomed
into a popular movement which threatened to engulf the whole of
Catalonia and the rest of Spain . . . [CNT militant] Arturo Parera later
confirmed that the FAI had not participated in the aborted movement 'as
an organisation.'"* [**We, the Anarchists**, p. 66] While the initial
revolts, such as those of the miners of Alto Llobregat in January 1932,
were spontaneous acts which caught the CNT and FAI by surprise, the
following insurrections became increasingly organised and co-ordinated
by those organisations. The January 1933 revolt, as noted above, was
based around a planned strike by the CNT railway workers union. The
revolt of December 1933 was organised by a National Revolutionary
Committee. Both revolts aimed at uprisings all across Spain, based on
the existing organisations of the CNT -- the unions and their "Defence
committees". Such a degree of planning belies any claims that Spanish
Anarchists were *"primitive rebels"* or did not understand the
complexities of modern society or what was required to change it.

Ultimately, Hobsbawm's thesis and its underlying model represents
Marxist arrogance and sectarianism. His model assumes the validity of
the Marxist claim that true working class movements are based on mass
political parties based on hierarchical, centralised, leadership and
those who reject this model and political action (electioneering) are
sects and sectarians. It was for this reason that Marx, faced with the
increased influence of Bakunin, overturned the First International's
original basis of free discussion with his own concept of what a real
workers' movement should be.

Originally, because the various sections of the International worked
under different circumstances and had attained different degrees of
development, the theoretical ideals which reflected the real movement
would also diverge. The International, therefore, was open to all
socialist and working class tendencies. The general policies of the
International would be, by necessity, based on conference decisions that
reflected the free political development that flowed from local needs.
These decisions would be determined by free discussion within and
between sections of all economic, social and political ideas. Marx,
however, replaced this policy with a common program of *"political
action"* (i.e. electioneering) by mass political parties via the fixed
Hague conference of 1872. Rather than having this position agreed by the
normal exchange of ideas and theoretical discussion in the sections
guided by the needs of the practical struggle, Marx imposed what **he**
considered as the future of the workers movement onto the International
-- and denounced those who disagreed with him as sectarians. The notion
that what Marx considered as necessary might be another sectarian
position imposed on the workers' movement did not enter his head nor
that of his followers -- as can be seen, Hobsbawm (mis)interpreted
anarchism and its history thanks to this Marxist model and vision.

However, once we look at the anarchist movement without the blinkers
created by Marxism, we see that rather than being a movement of
*"primitive rebels"* Spanish Anarchism was a movement of working class
people using valid tactics to meet their own social, economic and
political goals -- tactics and goals which evolved to meet changing
circumstances. Seeing the rise of anarchism and anarcho-syndicalism as
the political expression of the class struggle, guided by the needs of
the practical struggle they faced naturally follows when we recognise
the Marxist model for what it is -- just one possible interpretation of
the future of the workers' movement rather than **the** future of that
movement. Moreover, as the history of Social Democracy indicates, the
predictions of Bakunin and the anarchists within the First International
were proved correct. Therefore, rather than being *"primitive rebels"*
or sectarian politics forced upon the working class, anarchism reflected
the politics required to built a **revolutionary** workers' movement
rather than a reformist mass party.

2. How accurate is Felix Morrow's book on the Spanish Revolution?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

It is fair to say that most Marxists in Britain base their criticisms of
the Spanish Anarchism, particularly the revolution of 1936, on the work
of Trotskyist Felix Morrow. Morrow's book **Revolution and
Counter-Revolution in Spain**, first published in 1938, actually is not
that bad -- for some kinds of information. However, it is basically
written as Trotskyist propaganda. All too often Morrow is inaccurate,
and over-eager to bend reality to fit the party line. This is
particularly the case when discussing the actions and ideas of the CNT
and FAI and when discussing the activities of his fellow Trotskyists in
Spain, the Bolshevik-Leninists. We discuss the first set of inaccuracies
in the following sections, here we mention the second, Morrow's comments
on the Spanish Trotskyists.

The Bolshevik-Leninists, for example, an obscure sect who perhaps
numbered 20 members at most, are, according to Morrow, transformed into
the only ones who could save the Spanish Revolution -- because they
alone were members of the Fourth International, Morrow's own
organisation. As he put it:

> *"Only the small forces of the Bolshevik-Leninists. . . clearly
> pointed the road for the workers."* [Felix Morrow, **Revolution and
> Counter-Revolution in Spain**, p. 191]
>
> *"Could that party [the party needed to lead the revolution] be any
> but a party standing on the platform of the Fourth International?"*
> [**Op. Cit.**, p. 248]

And so on. As we will make clear in the following discussion, Morrow was
as wrong about this as he was about anarchism.

The POUM -- a more significant Marxist party in Spain, though still tiny
compared to the anarchists -- is also written up as far more important
than it was, and slagged off for failing to lead the masses to victory
(or listening to the Bolshevik-Leninists). The Fourth Internationalists
*"offered the POUM the rarest and most precious form of aid: a
consistent Marxist analysis"* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 105] (never mind Spanish
workers needing guns and solidarity!). But when such a programme --
prepared in advance -- was offered to the POUM by the Fourth
International representative -- only two hours after arriving in Spain,
and a quarter of an hour after meeting the POUM [**Op. Cit.**, p. 139]
-- the POUM were not interested. The POUM have been both attacked (and
claimed as their own) by Trotskyists ever since.

It is Morrow's attacks on anarchism, though, that have most readily
entered leftist folklore -- even among Marxists who reject Leninism.
Some of Morrow's criticisms are fair enough -- but these were voiced by
anarchists long before Morrow put pen to paper. Morrow, in fact, quotes
and accepts the analyses of anarchists like Camillo Berneri (*"Berneri
had been right"* etc. [**Op. Cit.**, p. 153]), and praises anarchists
like Durruti (*"the greatest military figure produced by the war"*
[**Op. Cit.**, p. 224]) -- then sticks the boot into anarchism. Indeed,
Durruti's analysis is praised but he is transformed into *"no
theoretician, but an activist leader of masses. . . his words express
the revolutionary outlook of the class-conscious workers."* [**Op.
Cit.**, p. 250] Of course, his words, activity and *"outlook"* (i.e.
political analysis) did not spring out of thin air but rather, to state
the obvious, were informed by and reflected his anarchist politics,
history, activity and vision (which in turn reflected his experiences
and needs as a member of the working class). Morrow obviously wanted to
have his cake and eat it.

Typically for today's left, perhaps, the most quoted sections of
Morrow's book are the most inaccurate. In the next eight sections we
discuss some of the most inaccurate claims. After that we point out that
Morrow's analysis of the militias is deeply ironic given Trotsky's
actions as leader of the Red Army. Then we discuss some of Morrow's
inaccurate assertions about anarchism in general.

Of course, some of the errors we highlight in Morrow's work are the
product of the conditions in which it was written -- thousands of miles
from Spain in America, dependent on papers produced by Spanish Marxists,
Anarchists and others. We cannot blame him for such mistakes (although
we can blame the Trotskyist publisher who reprints his account without
indicating his factual errors and the Marxist writers who repeat his
claims without checking their accuracy). We **do,** however, blame
Morrow for his errors and misrepresentations of the activities and
politics of the Spanish Anarchists and anarchism in general. These
errors derive from his politics and inability to understand anarchism or
provide an honest account of it.

By the end of our discussion we hope to show why anarchists argue that
Morrow's book is deeply flawed and its objectively skewed by the authors
politics and so cannot be taken at face value. Morrow's book may bring
comfort to those Marxists who look for ready-made answers and are
prepared to accept the works of hacks at face-value. Those who want to
learn from the past -- instead of re-writing it -- will have to look
elsewhere.

3. Did a *"highly centralised"* FAI control the CNT?
----------------------------------------------------

According to Morrow, *"Spanish Anarchism had in the FAI a highly
centralised party apparatus through which it maintained control of the
CNT"* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 100]

In reality, the FAI -- the Iberian Anarchist Federation -- was founded,
in 1927, as a confederation of regional federations (including the
Portuguese Anarchist Union). These regional federations, in turn,
co-ordinated local and district federations of highly autonomous
anarchist affinity groups. In the words of Murray Bookchin:

> *"Like the CNT, the FAI was structured along confederal lines: the
> affinity groups were linked together in a Local Federation and the
> Local Federation in District and Regional Federations. A Local
> Federation was administered by an ongoing secretariat, usually of
> three persons, and a committee composed of one mandated delegate from
> each affinity group. This body comprised a sort of local executive
> committee. To allow for a full expression of rank-and-file views, the
> Local Federation was obliged to convene assemblies of all the
> **faistas** in its area. The District and Regional Federations, in
> turn, were simply the Local federation writ large, replicating the
> structure of the lower body. All the Local Districts and Regional
> Federations were linked together by a Peninsular Committee whose
> tasks, at least theoretically, were administrative. . . [A FAI
> secretary] admits that the FAI 'exhibited a tendency towards
> centralism' . . . Yet it must also be emphasised that the affinity
> groups were far more independent than any comparable bodies in the
> Socialist Party, much less the Communist. . . the FAI was not an
> internally repressive organisation . . . Almost as a matter of second
> nature, dissidents were permitted a considerable amount of freedom in
> voicing and publishing material against the leadership and established
> policies."* [**The Spanish Anarchists**, pp. 197-8]

And:

> *"Most writers on the Spanish labour movement seem to concur in the
> view that, with the departure of the moderates, the CNT was to fall
> under the complete domination of the FAI . . . But is this appraisal
> correct? The FAI . . . was more loosely jointed as an organisation
> than many of its admirers and critics seem to recognise. It has no
> bureaucratic apparatus, no membership cards or dues, and no
> headquarters with paid officials, secretaries, and clerks. . . They
> jealously guarded the autonomy of their affinity groups from the
> authority of higher organisational bodies -- a state of mind hardly
> conducive to the development of a tightly knit, vanguard
> organisation.*
>
> "The FAI, moreover, was not a politically homogeneous organisation
> which followed a fixed 'line' like the Communists and many Socialists.
> It had no official program by which all **faistas** could mechanically
> guide their actions." [**Op. Cit.**, p. 224]

So, while the FAI may have had centralising tendencies, a *"highly
centralised"* political party it was not. Further, many
anarcho-syndicalists and affinity groups were not in the FAI (though
most seem to have supported it), and many FAI members put loyalty to the
CNT (the anarcho-syndicalist union confederation) first. For instance,
according to the minutes of the FAI national plenum of January-February
1936:

> *"The Regional Committee [of Aragon, Rioja, and Navarra] is completely
> neglected by the majority of the militants because they are absorbed
> in the larger activities of the CNT"*

And:

> *"One of the reasons for the poor condition of the FAI was the fact
> that almost all the comrades were active in the defence groups of the
> CNT"* (report from the Regional Federation of the North).

These are internal documents and so unlikely to be lies. [Juan Gomez
Casas, **Anarchist Organisation: the History of the FAI**, p. 165 and p.
168]

Anarchists were obviously the main influence in the CNT. Indeed, the CNT
was anarcho-syndicalist long before the FAI was founded -- from its
creation in 1910 the CNT had been anarcho-syndicalist and remained so
for 17 years before the FAI existed. However, Morrow was not the only
person to assert *"FAI control"* of the CNT. In fact, the claim of *"FAI
control"* was an invention of a reformist minority within the
organisation -- people like Angel Pestana, ex-CNT National Secretary,
who wanted to turn the CNT into a politically *"neutral"* union
movement. Pestana later showed what he meant by forming the Syndicalist
Party and standing for Parliament (the Cortes). Obviously, in the
struggle against the reformists, anarcho-syndicalists -- inside the FAI
or not -- voted for people they trusted to run CNT committees. The
reformists (called **Treinistas**) lost, split from the CNT (taking
about 10% of the membership with them), and the myth of *"FAI
dictatorship"* was born. Rather than accept that the membership no
longer supported them, the **Treinistas** consoled themselves with tales
that a minority, the FAI, had taken control of the CNT.

In fact, due to its decentralised and federal structure, the FAI could
not have had the sort of dominance over the CNT that is often attributed
to it. At union congresses, where policies and the program for the
movement were argued out:

> *"[D]elegates, whether or not they were members of the FAI, were
> presenting resolutions adopted by their unions at open membership
> meetings. Actions taken at the congress had to be reported back to
> their unions at open meetings, and given the degree of union education
> among the members, it was impossible for delegates to support
> personal, non-representative positions."* [Juan Gomez Casas,
> **Anarchist Organisation: The History of the FAI**, p. 121]

The union committees were typically rotated out of office frequently and
committeemen continued to work as wage-earners. In a movement so closely
based on the shop floor, the FAI could not maintain influence for long
if they ignored the concerns and opinions of co-workers. Moreover, only
a minority of the anarcho-syndicalist activists in the CNT belonged to
the FAI and, as Juan Gomez Casas points out in his history of the FAI,
FAI militants frequently had a prior loyalty to the CNT. Thus his
summation seems correct:

> *"As a minority organisation, the FAI could not possibly have had the
> kind of control attributed to it . . . in 1931 . . . there were fifty
> CNT members for each member of a FAI group. The FAI was strongly
> federalist, with its groups at the base freely associated. It could
> not dominate an organisation like the CNT, which had fifty times as
> many members and was also opposed to hierarchy and centralism. We know
> that FAI militants were also CNT militants, and frequently they were
> loyal first to the CNT. Their influence was limited to the base of the
> organisation through participation in the plenums of militants or
> unions meetings."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 133]

He sums up by arguing:

> *"The myth of the FAI as conqueror and ruler of the CNT was created
> basically by the **Treinistas**"* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 134]

Therefore, Morrow is re-cycling an argument which was produced by the
reformist wing of the CNT after it had lost influence in the union
rank-and-file. Perhaps he judges the FAI by his own standards? After
all, the aim of Leninists is for the vanguard party to control the
labour unions in their countries. Anarchists reject such a vision and
believe in union autonomy -- influence of political parties and groups
should only exist in as much as they influence the rank-and-file who
control the union. Rather than aim to control the CNT, the FAI worked to
influence its membership. In the words of Francisco Ascaso (friend of
Durruti and an influential anarchist militant in the CNT and FAI in his
own right):

> *"There is not a single militant who as a 'FAIista' intervenes in
> union meetings. I work, therefore I am an exploited person. I pay my
> dues to the workers' union and when I intervene at union meetings I do
> it as someone who us exploited, and with the right which is granted me
> by the card in my possession, as do the other militants, whether they
> belong to the FAI or not."* [cited by Abel Paz, **Durruti: The People
> Armed**, p. 137]

In other words, the FAI *"controlled"* the CNT only to the extent it
influenced the membership -- who, in fact, controlled the organisation.
We must also note that Ascaso's comment echoes Bakunin's that the
*"purpose of the Alliance [i.e. anarchist federation] is to promote the
Revolution . . . it will combat all ambition to dominate the
revolutionary movement of the people, either by cliques or individuals.
The Alliance will promote the Revolution only through the NATURAL BUT
NEVER OFFICIAL INFLUENCE of all members of the Alliance."* [**Bakunin on
Anarchism**, p. 387]

Regardless of Morrow's claims, the FAI was a federation of autonomous
affinity groups in which, as one member put it, *"[e]ach FAI group
thought and acted as it deemed fit, without bothering about what the
others might be thinking or deciding . . . they had no . . . opportunity
or jurisdiction . . . to foist a party line upon the grass-roots."*
[Francisco Carrasquer, quoted by Stuart Christie, **We, the
Anarchists!**, p. 28] There was co-ordination in a federal structure, of
course, but that did not create a *"highly centralised"* party-like
organisation. Morrow judged the FAI according to his own standards,
squeezing it into his ideological vision of the world rather than
reporting the reality of the situation (see Stuart Christie's work for a
more detailed refutation of the usual Marxist and Liberal inventions of
the activities and nature of the FAI).

In addition, Morrow's picture of the FAI implicitly paints the CNT as a
mere "transmission belt" for that organisation (and so a re-production
of the Bolshevik position on the relationship of the labour unions and
the revolutionary party). Such a picture, however, ignores the CNT's
character as a non-hierarchical, democratic (self-managed) mass movement
which had many tendencies within it. It also fails to understand the way
anarchists seek to influence mass organisations -- not by assuming
positions of power but by convincing their fellow workers' of the
validity of their ideas in policy making mass assemblies (see [section
J.3.6](secJ3.html#secj36) for more details).

In other words, Morrow's claims are simply false and express a total
lack of understanding of the nature of the CNT, the FAI and their
relationship.

4. What is the history of the CNT and the Communist International?
------------------------------------------------------------------

Morrow states that the *"tide of the October Revolution had, for a short
time, overtaken the CNT. It had sent a delegate to the Comintern
[Communist International] Congress in 1921. The anarchists had then
resorted to organised fraction work and recaptured it."* [**Op. Cit.**,
p. 100] He links this to the FAI by stating *"[t]henceforward . . . the
FAI . . . maintained control of the CNT."* Given that the FAI was formed
in 1927 and the CNT disassociated itself with the Comintern in 1922,
five years before the FAI was created, *"thenceforward"* does not do the
FAI's ability to control the CNT before it was created justice!

Partly it is the inability of the Communist Party and its Trotskyist
off-shoots to dominate the CNT which explains Morrow's comments. Seeing
anarchism as *"petty bourgeois"* it is hard to combine this with the
obvious truth that a mass, revolutionary, workers' union could be so
heavily influenced by anarchism rather than Marxism. Hence the need for
FAI (or anarchist) "control" of the CNT. It allows Trotskyists ignore
dangerous ideological questions. As J. Romero Maura notes, the question
why anarchism influenced the CNT *"in fact raises the problem why the
reformist social democratic, or alternatively the communist conceptions,
did not impose themselves on the CNT as they managed to in most of the
rest of Europe. This question . . . is based on the false assumption
that the anarcho-syndicalist conception of the workers' struggle in
pre-revolutionary society was completely at odds with what the **real**
social process signified (hence the constant reference to religious',
'messianic', models as explanations)."* He argues that the *"explanation
of Spanish anarcho-syndicalist success in organising a mass movement
with a sustained revolutionary **elan** should initially be sought in
the very nature of the anarchist concept of society and of how to
achieve revolution."* [J. Romero Maura, *"The Spanish Case"*, in
**Anarchism Today**, D. Apter and J. Joll (eds.), p. 78 and p. 65] Once
we do that, we can see the weakness of Morrow's (and others) *"Myth of
the FAI"* -- having dismissed the obvious reason for anarchist
influence, namely its practicality and valid politics, there can only be
"control by the FAI."

However, the question of affiliation of the CNT to the Comintern is
worth discussing as it indicates the differences between anarchists and
Leninists. As will be seen, the truth of this matter is somewhat
different to Morrow's claims and indicates well his distorted vision.

Firstly to correct a factual error. The CNT in fact sent two delegations
to the Comintern. At its 1919 national congress, the CNT discussed the
Russian Revolution and accepted a proposition that stated it *"declares
itself a staunch defender of the principles upheld by Bakunin in the
First International. It declares further that it affiliates
provisionally to the Third International on account of its predominantly
revolutionary character, pending the holding of the International
Congress in Spain, which must establish the foundations which are to
govern the true workers' International."* [**No Gods, No Masters**, vol.
2, pp. 220-1]

In June 1920, Angel Pestana arrived in Moscow and represented the CNT at
the Second Congress of the Communist International. He was arrested when
he arrived back in Spain and so could not give his eye-witness account
of the strangulation of the revolution and the deeply dishonest
manipulation of the congress by the Communist Party. A later delegation
arrived in April 1921, headed by Andres Nin and Joaquin Maurin
professing to represent the CNT. Actually, Nin and Maurin represented
virtually no one but the Lerida local federation (their stronghold).
Their actions and clams were disavowed by a plenum of the CNT the
following August.

How did Nin and Maurin manage to get into a position to be sent to
Russia? Simply because of the repression the CNT was under at the time.
This was the period when Catalan bosses hired gun men to assassinate CNT
militants and members and the police exercised the notorious practice
known as **ley de fugas** (shot while trying to escape). In such a
situation, the normal workings of the CNT came under must stress and
*"with the best known libertarian militants imprisoned, deported,
exiled, if not murdered outright, Nin and his group managed to hoist
themselves on to the National Committee . . . Pestana's report not being
available, it was decided that a further delegation should be sent . . .
in response to Moscow's invitation to the CNT to take part in the
foundation of the Red International of Labour Unions."* [Ignaio de
Llorens, **The CNT and the Russian Revolution**, p. 8] Juan Gomez Casas
confirms this account:

> *"At a plenum held in Lerida in 1921, while the CNT was in disarray
> [due to repression] in Catalonia, a group of Bolsheviks was designated
> to represent the Spanish CNT in Russia . . . The restoration of
> constitutional guarantees by the Spanish government in April 1922,
> permitted the anarcho-syndicalists to meet in Saragossa in June 11 . .
> . [where they] confirmed the withdrawal of the CNT from the Third
> International and the entrance on principle into the new
> [revolutionary syndicalist] International Working Men's Association."*
> [**Anarchist Organisation: History of the FAI**, p. 61]

We should note that along with pro-Bolshevik Nin and Maurin was
anarchist Gaston Leval. Leval quickly got in touch with Russian and
other anarchists, helping some imprisoned Russia anarchists get deported
after bringing news of their hunger strike to the assembled
international delegates. By embarrassing Lenin and Trotsky, Leval helped
save his comrades from the prison camp and so saved their lives.

By the time Leval arrived back in Spain, Pestana's account of his
experiences had been published -- along with accounts of the Bolshevik
repression of workers, the Kronstadt revolt, the anarchist movement and
other socialist parties. These accounts made it clear that the Russian
Revolution had become dominated by the Communist Party and the
*"dictatorship of the proletariat"* little more that dictatorship by the
central committee of that party.

Moreover, the way the two internationals operated violated basic
libertarian principles. Firstly, the *"Red Labour International
completely subordinated trade unions to the Communist Party."* [Peirats,
**Anarchists in the Spanish Revolution**, p. 38] This completely
violated the CNT principle of unions being controlled by their members
(via self-management from the bottom up). Secondly, the congresses'
methodology in its debates and decision-making were alien to the CNT
tradition. In that organisation self-management was its pride and glory
and its gatherings and congresses reflected this. Pestana could not
fathom the fierce struggle surrounding the make-up of the chairmanship
of the Comintern congress:

> *"Pestana says that he was particularly intrigued by the struggle for
> the chairmanship. He soon realised that the chair **was** the
> congress, and that the Congress was a farce. The chairman made the
> rules, presided over deliberations, modified proposals at will,
> changed the agenda, and presented proposals of his own. For a start,
> the way the chair handled the gavel was very inequitable. For example,
> Zinoviev gave a speech which lasted one and one-half hours, although
> each speaker was supposedly limited to ten minutes. Pestana tried to
> rebut the speech, but was cut off by the chairman, watch in hand.
> Pestana himself was rebutted by Trotsky who spoke for three-quarters
> of an hour, and when Pestana wanted to answer Trotsky's attack on him,
> the chairman declared the debate over."* [**Op. Cit.**, pp. 37-8]

In addition, *"[i]n theory, every delegate was free to table a motion,
but the chair itself selected the ones that were 'interesting.'
Proportional voting [by delegation or delegate] had been provided for,
but was not implemented. The Russian Communist Party ensured that it
enjoyed a comfortable majority."* Peirats continues by noting that
*"[t]o top it all, certain important decisions were not even made in the
congress hall, but were made begin the scenes."* That was how the
resolution that *"[i]n forthcoming world congresses of the Third
International, the national trade union organisations affiliated to it
are to be represented by delegates from each country's Communist Party"*
was adopted. He also noted that *"[o]bjections to this decision were
quite simply ignored."* [**No Gods, No Masters**, vol. 2, p. 224]

Many of the syndicalist delegates to this *"pantomime"* congress later
meet in Berlin and founded the anarcho-syndicalist **International
Workers Association** based on union autonomy, self-management and
federalism. Unsurprisingly, once Pestana and Leval reported back to
their organisation, the CNT rejected the Bolshevik Myth and re-affirmed
the libertarian principles it had proclaimed at its 1919 congress. At a
plenum of the CNT in 1922, the organisation withdrew its provisional
affiliation and voted to join the syndicalist International formed in
Berlin.

Therefore, rather than the anarchists conducting *"fraction work"* to
*"recapture"* the CNT, the facts are the pro-Bolshevik National
Committee of 1921 came about due to the extreme repression the CNT was
suffering at the time. Militants were being assassinated in the streets,
including committee members. In this context it is easy to see how an
unrepresentative minority could temporarily gain influence in the
National Committee. Moreover, it was CNT plenary session which revoked
the organisations provisional affiliation to the Comintern -- that is, a
regular meeting of mandated and accountable delegates. In other words,
by the membership itself who had been informed of what had actually been
happening under the Bolsheviks. In addition, it was this plenum which
agreed affiliation to the anarcho-syndicalist **International Workers
Association** founded in Berlin during 1922 by syndicalists and
anarchists horrified by the Bolshevik dictatorship, having seen it at
first hand.

Thus the decision of the CNT in 1922 (and the process by which this
decision was made) follow exactly the decisions and processes of 1919.
That congress agreed to provisionally affiliate to the Comintern until
such time as a real workers' International inspired by the ideas of
Bakunin was created. The only difference was that this International was
formed in Germany, not Spain. Given this, it is impossible to argue that
the anarchists *"recaptured"* the CNT.

As can be seen, Morrow's comment presents radically false image of what
happened during this period. Rather than resort to *"fraction work"* to
*"recapture"* the CNT, the policies of the CNT in 1919 and 1922 were
identical. Moreover, the decision to disaffiliate from the Comintern was
made by a confederal meeting of mandated delegates representing the
rank-and-file as was the original. The anarchists did not "capture" the
CNT, rather they continued to influence the membership of the
organisation as they had always done. Lastly, the concept of "capture"
displays no real understanding of how the CNT worked -- each syndicate
was autonomous and self-managed. There was no real officialdom to take
over, just administrative posts which were unpaid and conducted after
working hours. To "capture" the CNT was impossible as each syndicate
would ignore any unrepresentative minority which tried to do so.

However, Morrow's comments allow us to indicate some of the key
differences between anarchists and Leninists -- the CNT rejected the
Comintern because it violated its principles of self-management, union
autonomy and equality and built party domination of the union movement
in its place.

5. Why did the CNT not join the Workers' Alliance?
--------------------------------------------------

Morrow in his discussion of the struggles of the 1930s implies that the
CNT was at fault in not joining the Socialist UGT's *"Workers'
Alliance"* (**Alianza Obrera**). These were first put forward by the
Marxist-Leninists of the BOC (Workers and Peasants Bloc -- later to form
the POUM) after their attempts to turn the CNT into a Bolshevik vanguard
failed [Paul Preston, **The Coming of the Spanish Civil War**, p. 154].
Socialist Party and UGT interest began only after their election defeat
in 1933. By 1934, however, there existed quite a few alliances,
including one in Asturias in which the CNT participated. Nationally,
however, the CNT refused to join with the UGT and this, he implies, lead
to the defeat of the October 1934 uprising (see [next
section](append32.html#app6) for a discussion of this rebellion).

However, Morrow fails to provide any relevant historical background to
understand the CNT's decision. Moreover, their reasons **why** they did
not join have a striking similarity to Morrow's own arguments against
the "Workers' Alliance" (which may explain why Morrow does not mention
them). In effect, the CNT is dammed for having policies similar to
Morrow's but having principles enough to stick to them.

First, we must discuss the history of UGT and CNT relationships in order
to understand the context within which the anarchists made their
decision. Unless we do this, Morrow's claims may seem more reasonable
than they actually are. Once we have done this we will discuss the
politics of that decision.

From 1931 (the birth of the Second Spanish Republic) to 1933 the
Socialists, in coalition with Republicans, had attacked the CNT (a
repeat, in many ways, of the UGT's collaboration with the quasi-fascist
Primo de Rivera dictatorship of 1923-30). Laws were passed, with
Socialist help, making lightening strikes illegal and state arbitration
compulsory. Anarchist-organised strikes were violently repressed, and
the UGT provided scabs -- as against the CNT Telephone Company strike of
1931. This strike gives in indication of the role of the socialists
during its time as part of the government (Socialist Largo Caballero was
the Minister of Labour, for example):

> *"The UGT . . . had its own bone to pick with the CNT. The telephone
> syndicate, which the CNT had established in 1918, was a constant
> challenge to the Socialists' grip on the Madrid labour movement. Like
> the construction workers' syndicate, it was a CNT enclave in a solidly
> UGT centre. Accordingly, the government and the Socialist Party found
> no difficulty in forming a common front to break the strike and weaken
> CNT influence.*
>
> "The Ministry of Labour declared the strike illegal and the Ministry
> of the Interior called out the Civil Guard to intimidate the strikers
> . . . Shedding all pretence of labour solidarity, the UGT provided the
> **Compania Telefonica** with scabs while **El Socialista**, the
> Socialist Party organ, accused the CNT of being run by **pistoleros.**
> Those tactics were successful in Madrid, where the defeated strikers
> were obliged to enrol in the UGT to retain their jobs. So far as the
> Socialists were concerned, the CNT's appeals for solidarity had fallen
> on deaf ears. . .
>
> "In Seville, however, the strike began to take on very serious
> dimensions. . . on July 20, a general strike broke out in Seville and
> serious fighting erupted in the streets. This strike . . . stemmed
> from the walkout of the telephone workers . . . pitched battles took
> place in the countryside around the city between the Civil Guard and
> the agricultural workers. Maura, as minister of interior, decided to
> crush the 'insurrection' ruthlessly. Martial law was declared and the
> CNT's headquarters was reduced to shambles by artillery fire. After

Elsewhere, *"[d]uring a Barcelona building strike CNT workers barricaded
themselves in and said they would only surrender to regular troops. The
army arrived and then machine-gunned them as soon as they surrendered."*
[Antony Beevor, **The Spanish Civil War**, p. 33] In other words, the
republican-socialist government repressed the CNT with violence as well
as using the law to undermine CNT activities and strikes.

Morrow fails to discuss this history of violence against the CNT. He
mentions in passing that the republican-socialist coalition government
*"[i]n crushing the CNT, the troops broadened the repression to the
whole working class."* He states that *"[u]nder the cover of putting
down an anarchist putsch in January 1933, the Civil Guard 'mopped up'
various groups of trouble makers. And encounter with peasants at Casas
Viejas, early in January 1933, became a **cause celebre** which shook
the government to its foundations."* However, his account of the Casas
Viejas massacre is totally inaccurate. He states that *"the little
village . . ., after two years of patient waiting for the Institute of
Agrarian Reform to divide the neighbouring Duke's estate, the peasants
had moved in and begun to till the soil for themselves."* [**Op. Cit.**,
p. 22]

Nothing could be further from the truth. Firstly, we must note that the
land workers (who were not, in the main, peasants) were members of the
CNT. Secondly, as we pointed in [section 1](append32.html#app1), the
uprising had nothing to do with land reform. The CNT members did not
*"till the soil"*, rather they rose in insurrection as part of a planned
CNT-FAI uprising based on an expected rail workers strike (the
*"anarchist putsch"* Morrow mentions). The workers were too busy
fighting the Civil and Assault Guards to till anything. He is correct in
terms of the repression, of course, but his account of the events
leading up to it is not only wrong, it is misleading (indeed, it appears
to be an invention based on Trotskyist ideology rather than having any
basis in reality). Rather than being part of a *"broadened . . .
repression [against] the whole working class,"* it was actually part of
the *"putting down"* of the anarchist revolt. CNT members were killed --
along with a dozen politically neutral workers who were selected at
random and murdered. Thus Morrow downplays the role of the Socialists in
repressing the CNT and FAI -- he presents it as general repression
rather than a massacre resulting from repressing a CNT revolt.

He even quotes a communist paper stating that 9 000 political prisoners
were in jail in June 1933. Morrow states that they were *"mostly
workers."* [p. 23] Yes, they were mostly workers, CNT members in fact --
*"[i]n mid-April [1933]. . . the CNT launched a massive campaign to
release imprisoned CNT-FAI militants whose numbers had now soared to
about 9 000."* [Bookchin, **Op. Cit.**, pp. 231-2]

Moreover, during and after CNT insurrections in Catalonia in 1932, and
the much wider insurrections of January 1933 (9 000 CNT members jailed)
and December 1933 (16 000 jailed) Socialist solidarity was nil. Indeed,
the 1932 and January 1933 revolts had been repressed by the government
which the Socialist Party was a member of.

In other words, and to state the obvious, the socialists had been part
of a government which repressed CNT revolts and syndicates, imprisoned
and killed their members, passed laws to restrict their ability to
strike and use direct action and provided scabs during strikes. Little
wonder that Peirats states *"[i]t was difficult for the CNT and the FAI
to get used to the idea of an alliance with their Socialist
oppressors."* [**Anarchists in the Spanish Revolution**, p. 94]

It is **only** in this context can we understand the events of 1934 and
the refusal of the CNT to run into the UGT's alliance. Morrow, needless
to say, does not present this essential context and so the reader cannot
understand why the CNT acted as it did in response to Socialist appeals
for "unity." Instead, Morrow implies that CNT-FAI opposition to "workers
alliances" were due to them believing *"all governments were equally
bad."* [p. 29] Perhaps if Morrow had presented an honest account of the
repression the republican-socialist government had inflicted on the CNT
then the reader could make an informed judgement on why anarchist
opposition to the socialist proposals existed. Rather than being
sectarian or against labour unity, they had been at receiving end of
extensive socialist scabbing and state repression.

Moreover, as well as the recent history of socialist repression and
scabbing, there was also the experience of a similar alliance between
the CNT and UGT that had occurred in 1917. The first test of the
alliance came with a miners strike in Andalusia, and a *"CNT proposal
for a joint general strike, to be initiated by UGT miners and railway
workers, had been rejected by the Madrid Socialists . . . the miners,
after striking for four months, returned to work in defeat."* Little
wonder that *"the pact was in shreds. It was to be eliminated completely
when a general strike broke out in Barcelona over the arrests of the CNT
leaders and the assassination of Layret. Once again the CNT called upon
the UGT for support. Not only was aid refused but it was denied with an
arrogance that clearly indicated the Socialists had lost all interest in
future collaboration. . . The strike in Catalonia collapsed and, with
it, any prospect of collaboration between the two unions for years to
come."* [Bookchin, **Op. Cit.**, pp. 175-6]

Of course, such historical context would confuse readers with facts and
so goes unmentioned by Morrow.

In addition, there was another reason for opposing the "workers'
alliances" -- particularly an alliance between the UGT and CNT. Given
the history of UGT and CNT pacts plus the actions of the UGT and
socialists in the previous government it was completely sensible and
politically principled. This reason was political and flowed from the
CNT's libertarian vision. As Durruti argued in 1934:

> *"The alliance, to be revolutionary, must be genuinely working class.
> It must be the result of an agreement between the workers'
> organisation, and those alone. No party, however, socialist it may be,
> can belong to a workers' alliance, which should be built from its
> foundations, in the enterprises where the workers struggle. Its
> representative bodies must be the workers' committee chosen in the
> shops, the factories, the mines and the villages. We must reject any
> agreement on a national level, between National Committees, but rather
> favour an alliance carried out at the base by the workers themselves.
> Then and only then, can the revolutionary drive come to life, develop
> and take root."* [quoted by Abel Paz, **Durruti: The People Armed**,
> p. 154]

In the Central Region, Orobon Fernandez argued along similar lines in
Madrid's **La Tierra**:

> *"Revolutionary proletarian democracy is direct management of society
> by the workers, a certain bulwark against party dictatorships and a
> guarantee of the development of the revolution's forces and
> undertakings. . . what matters must is that general guidelines are
> laid down so that these may serve as a platform of the alliance and
> furnish a combative and constructive norm for the united forces . . .
> [These include:] acceptance of revolutionary proletarian democracy,
> which is to say, the will of the majority of the proletariat, as the
> common denominator and determining factor of the new order of things.
> . . immediate socialisation of the means of production,
> transportation, exchange, accommodation and finance . . . federated
> according to their area of interest and confederated at national
> level, the municipal and industrial organisations will maintain the
> principle of unity in the economic structure."* [quoted by Jose
> Peirats, **The CNT in the Spanish Revolution**, vol. 1, pp. 74-5]

The May 1936 Saragossa congress of the CNT passed a resolution
concerning revolutionary alliances which was obviously based on these
arguments. It stated that in order *"to make the social revolution an
effective reality, the social and political system regulating the life
of the country has to be utterly destroyed"* and that the *"new
revolutionary order will be determined by the free choice of the working
class."* [quoted by Jose Peirats, **Op. Cit.**, p. 100]

Only such an alliance, from the bottom up and based on workers'
self-management could be a revolutionary one. Indeed, any pact not based
on this but rather conducted between organisations would be a pact the
CNT and the bureaucracy of the UGT -- and remove any possibility of
creating genuine bodies of working class self-management (as the history
of the Civil War proved). Indeed, Morrow seems to agree:

> *"The broad character of the proletarian insurrection was explained by
> the Communist Left (Trotskyist). It devoted itself to efforts to build
> the indispensable instrument of the insurrection: workers' councils
> constituted by delegates representing all the labour parties and
> unions, the shops and streets; to be created in every locality and
> joined together nationally . . . Unfortunately, the socialists failed
> to understand the profound need of these Workers' Alliances. The
> bureaucratic traditions were not to be so easily overcome . . . the
> socialist leaders thought that the Workers' Alliances meant they would
> have merely to share leadership with the Communist Left and other
> dissident communist groups . . . actually in most cases they [Workers'
> Alliances] were merely 'top' committees, without elected or lower-rank
> delegates, that is, little more than liaison committees between the
> leadership of the organisations involved."* [**Op. Cit.**, pp. 27-8]

As can be seen, this closely follows Durruti's arguments. Bar the
reference of *"labour parties,"* Morrow's *"indispensable instrument"*
is identical to Durruti's and other anarchist's arguments against taking
part in the "Workers' Alliances" created by the UGT and the creation of
genuine alliances from the bottom-up. Thus Morrow faults the CNT for
trying to force the UGT to form a **real** workers' alliance by not
taking part in what Morrow himself admits were *"little more than
liaison committees between the leadership"*! Also, Morrow argues that
*"[w]ithout developing soviets -- workers' councils -- it was inevitable
that even the anarchists and the POUM would drift into governmental
collaboration with the bourgeoisie"* and he asks *"[h]ow could party
agreements be the substitute for the necessary vast network of workers'
councils?"* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 89 and p. 114] Which was, of course, the
CNT-FAI's argument. It seems strange that Morrow faults the CNT for
trying to create real workers' councils, the *"indispensable
instrument"* of the revolution, by not taking part in a *"party
agreements"* urged by the UGT which would undermine real attempts at
rank-and-file unity from below.

Of course, Morrow's statement that *"labour parties and unions"* should
be represented by delegates as well as *"the shop and street"*
contradicts claims it would be democratic. After all, that it would mean
that some workers would have multiple votes (one from their shop, their
union and their party). Moreover, it would mean that parties would have
an influence greater than their actual support in the working class --
something a minuscule group like the Spanish Trotskyists would obviously
favour as would the bureaucrats of the Socialist and Communist Parties.
Little wonder the anarchists urged a workers' alliance made up of actual
workers rather than an organisation which would allow bureaucrats,
politicians and sects more influence than they actually had or deserved.

In addition, the "Workers' Alliances" were not seen by the UGT and
Socialist Party as an organisation of equals. Rather, in words of
historian Paul Preston, *"from the first it seemed that the Socialists
saw the Alianza Obrera was a possible means of dominating the workers
movement in areas where the PSOE and UGT were relatively weak."* [**Op.
Cit.**, p. 154] The Socialist Party only allowed regional branches of
the Alianza Obrera to be formed only if they could guarantee Party
control would never be lost. [Adrian Schubert *"The Epic Failure: The
Asturian Revolution of October 1934"*, in **Revolution and War in
Spain**, Paul Preston (ed.), p. 127] Raymond Carr argues that the
Socialists, *"in spite of professions to the contrary, wished to keep
socialist domination of the **Alianza Obrera**"* [**Spain: 1808-1975**,
pp. 634-5f] And only one month after the first alliance was set up, one
of its founder members -- the Catalan **Socialist Union** -- left in
protest over PSOE domination. [Preston, **The Coming of the Spanish
Civil War**, p. 157] In Madrid, the Alianza was *"dominated by the
Socialists, who imposed their own policy."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 154]
Indeed, as Jose Peirats notes, in Asturias where the CNT had joined the
Alliance, *"despite the provisions of the terms of the alliance to which
the CNT had subscribed, the order for the uprising was issued by the
socialists. In Oviedo a specifically socialist, revolutionary committee
was secretly at work in Oviedo, which contained no CNT
representatives."* [**The CNT in the Spanish Revolution**, vol. 1, p.
78] Largo Caballero's desire for trade union unity in 1936 was from a
similar mould -- *"[t]he clear implication was that proletarian
unification meant Socialist take-over."* Little wonder Preston states
that *"[i]f the use that he [Caballero] made of the Alianza Obreras in
1934 had revealed anything, it was that the domination of the working
class movement by the UGT meant far more to Largo Caballero than any
future prospect of revolution."* [Preston, **Op. Cit.**, p. 270]

As can be seen, the CNT's position seemed a sensible one given the
nature and activities of the "Workers' Alliance" in practice. Also it
seems strange that, if unity was the UGT's aims, that a CNT call, made
by the national plenary in February 1934, for information and for the
UGT to clearly and publicly state its revolutionary objectives, met with
no reply. [Peirats, **Op. Cit.**, p. 75] In addition, the Catalan
Workers' Alliance called a general strike in March 1934 the day
**after** the CNT's -- hardly an example of workers' unity. [Norman
Jones, *"Regionalism and Revolution in Catalonia"*, **Revolution and War
in Spain**, Paul Preston (ed.), p. 102]

Thus, the reasons why the CNT did not join in the UGT's "Workers'
Alliance" are clear. As well as the natural distrust towards
organisations that had repressed them and provided scabs to break their
strikes just one year previously, there were political reasons for
opposing such an alliance. Rather than being a force to ensure
revolutionary organisations springing from the workplace, the "Workers'
Alliance" was little more than pacts between the bureaucrats of the UGT
and various Marxist Parties. This was Morrow's own argument, which also
provided the explanation why such an alliance would weaken any real
revolutionary movement. To requote Morrow, *"[w]ithout developing
soviets -- workers' councils -- it was inevitable that even the
anarchists and the POUM would drift into governmental collaboration with
the bourgeoisie."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 89]

That is exactly what happened in July, 1936, when the CNT did forsake
its anarchist politics and joined in a "Workers' Alliance" type
organisation with other anti-fascist parties and unions to set up the
*"Central Committee of Anti-Fascist Militias"* (see [section
20](append32.html#app20)). Thus Morrow himself provides the explanation
of the CNT's **political** rationale for being wary of the UGT's
*"Workers' Alliance"* while, of course, refusing to provide the
historical context the decision was made.

However, while the CNT's refusal to join the "Workers' Alliance" outside
of Asturias may have been principled (and sensible), it may be argued
that they were the only organisation with revolutionary potential
(indeed, this would be the only argument Trotskyists could put forward
to explain their hypocrisy). Such an argument would be false for two
reason.

Firstly, such Alliances may have potentially created a revolutionary
situation but they would have hindered the formation of working class
organs of self-management such as workers' councils (soviets). This was
the experience of the Central Committee of Anti-Fascist Militias and of
the Asturias revolt -- in spite of massive revolutionary upheaval such
councils based on delegates from workplace and community assembles were
**not** formed.

Secondly, the CNT policy of "Unity, yes, but by the rank-and-file" was a
valid method of "from the bottom up solidarity." This can be seen from
just two examples -- Aragon in 1934 and Madrid in 1936. In Aragon, there
was a *"general strike that had totally paralysed the Aragonese capital
throughout April 1935, ending . . . on 10 May. . . the Zaragoza general
strike had been a powerful advertisement of the value of a united
working-class front . . . [However,] no formal agreement . . . had been
reached in Zaragoza. The pact there has been created on a purely
circumstantial basis with a unity of trade-union action achieved in
quite specific circumstances and generated to a considerable extent by
the workers themselves."* [Graham Kelsey, **Anarchism in Aragon**, p.
72] In Madrid, April 1936 (in the words of Morrow himself) *"the CNT
declared a general strike in Madrid . . . The UGT had not been asked to
join the strike, and at first had denounced it . . . But the workers
came out of all the shops and factories and public services . . .
because they wanted to fight, and only the anarchists were calling them
to struggle."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 41]

Thus Morrow's comments against the CNT refusing to join the Workers'
Alliance do not provide the reader with the historical context required
to make an informed judgement of the CNT's decision. Moreover, they seem
hypocritical as the CNT's reasons for refusing to join is similar to
Morrow's own arguments against the Workers' Alliance. In addition, the
CNT's practical counter-proposal of solidarity from below had more
revolutionary potential as it was far more likely to promote
rank-and-file unity plus the creation of self-managed organisations such
as workers' councils. The Workers' Alliance system would have hindered
such developments.

6. Was the October 1934 revolt sabotaged by the CNT?
----------------------------------------------------

Again, following Morrow, Marxists have often alleged that the Socialist
and Workers Alliance strike wave, of October 1934, was sabotaged by the
CNT. To understand this allegation, you have to understand the
background to October 1934, and the split in the workers' movement
between the CNT and the UGT (unions controlled by the reformist
Socialist Party, the PSOE).

Socialist conversion to "revolution" occurred only after the elections
of November 1933. In the face of massive and bloody repression (see
[last section](append32.html#app5)), the CNT-FAI had agitated for a mass
abstention at the polling booth. Faced with this campaign, the
republicans and socialists lost and all the laws they had passed against
the CNT were used against themselves. When cabinet seats were offered to
the non-republican (fascist or quasi-fascist) right, in October 1934,
the PSOE/UGT called for a general strike. If the CNT, nationally, failed
to take part in this -- a mistake recognised by many anarchist writers
-- this was not (as reading Morrow suggests) because the CNT thought
*"all governments were equally bad"* [Morrow, **Op. Cit.**, p. 29], but
because of well-founded, as it turned out, mistrust of Socialist aims.

A CNT call, on the 13th of February 1934, for the UGT to clearly and
publicly state its revolutionary objectives, had met with no reply. As
Peirats argues, *"[t]hat the absence of the CNT did not bother them [the
UGT and Socialist Party] is clear from their silence in regards to the
[CNT's] National Plenary's request."* [Peirats, **Anarchists in the
Spanish Revolution**, p. 96] Rhetoric aside, the Socialist Party's main
aim in October seems to have been to force new elections, so they could
again form a (mildly reformist) coalition with the Republicans (their
programme for the revolt was written by right-wing socialist Indalecio
Prieto and seemed more like an election manifesto prepared by the
Liberal Republicans than a program for revolutionary change). This was
the viewpoint of the CNT, for example. Thus, the CNT, in effect, was to
be used as cannon-fodder to help produce another government that would
attack the CNT.

As we discussed in the [last section](append32.html#app5), the UGT
backed "Workers Alliances" were little better. To repeat our comments
again, the Socialist Party (PSOE) saw the alliances as a means of
dominating the workers movement in areas where the UGT was weak. The
Socialist "Liaison Committee", for instance, set up to prepare for
insurrection, only allowed regional branches to take part in the
alliances if they could guarantee Party control (see [last
section](append32.html#app5)). Raymond Carr argues that the Socialists,
*"in spite of professions to the contrary, wished to keep socialist
domination of the **Alianza Obrera.**"* [**Spain: 1808-1975**, pp.
634-5f] Only one month after the first alliance was set up, one of its
founder members -- the Socialist Union of Catalonia -- left in protest
over PSOE domination.

During October the only real centre of resistance was in Asturias (on
the Spanish north coast). However, before discussing that area, we must
mention Madrid and Barcelona. According to Morrow, Catalonia *"should
have been the fortress of the uprising"* and that *"[t]erribly
discredited for their refusal to join the October revolt, the anarchists
sought to apologise by pointing to the repression they were undergoing
at the time from Companys."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 30 and p. 32] Morrow
fails, however and yet again, to mention a few important facts.

Firstly, the uprising in Catalonia was pushed for and lead by Estat
Catala which had *"temporary ascendancy over the other groups in the
Esquerra"* (the Catalan Nationalist Party which was the Catalan
government). *"Companys felt obliged to yield to Dencas' [the leader of
Estat Catala] demand that Catalonia should take this opportunity for
breaking with Madrid."* [Gerald Brenan, **The Spanish Labyrinth**, pp.
282-3] Estat Catala *"was a Youth movement . . . and composed mostly of
workmen and adventurers -- men drawn from the same soil as the
**sindicatos libres** [boss created anti-CNT yellow unions] of a dozen
years before -- with a violent antagonism to the Anarcho-Syndicalists.
It had a small military organisation, the **escamots**, who wore green
uniforms. It represented Catalan Nationalism in its most intransigent
form: it was in fact Catalan Fascism."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 282] Gabriel
Jackson calls Estat Catala a *"quasi-fascist movement within the younger
ranks of the Esquerra."* [**The Spanish Republic and the Civil War:
1931-1939**, p. 150] Ronald Fraser terms it *"the extreme nationalist
and proto-fascist"* wing of the party. [**Blood of Spain**, p. 535] Hugh
Thomas notes *"the fascist colouring of Dencas ideas."* [**The Spanish
Civil War**, p. 135]

In other words, Morrow attacks the CNT for not participating in a revolt
organised and led by Catalan Fascists (or, at best, near fascists)!

Secondly, far from being apologetics, the repression the CNT was
suffering from Dencas police forces was very real and was occurring
right up to the moment of the revolt. In the words of historian Paul
Preston:

> *"[T]he Anarchists bitterly resented the way in which the Generalitat
> had followed a repressive policy against them in the previous months.
> This had been the work of the Generalitat's counsellor for public
> order, Josep Dencas, leader of the quasi-fascist, ultra-nationalist
> party Estat Catala."* [**The Coming of the Spanish Civil War**, p.
> 176]

This is confirmed by anarchist accounts of the rising. As Peirats points
out:

> *"On the eve of the rebellion the Catalan police jailed as many
> anarchists as they could put their hands on . . . The union offices
> had been shut for some time. The press censor had completely blacked
> out the October 6th issue of **Solidaridad Obrera** . . . When the
> woodworkers began to open their offices, they were attacked by the
> police, and a furious gunfight ensured. The official radio . . .
> reported . . . that the fight had already began against the FAI
> fascists . . . In the afternoon large numbers of police and
> **escamots** turned out to attack and shut down the editorial offices
> of **Solidaridad Obrera**."* [Peirats, **Op. Cit.**, pp. 98-9]

In other words, the first shots fired in the Catalan revolt were against
the CNT by those in revolt against the central government!

Why were the first shots of the revolt directed at the members of the
CNT? Simply because they were trying to take part in the revolt in an
organised and coherent manner as urged by the CNT's Regional Committee
itself. In spite of the mass arrests of anarchists and CNT militants the
night before by the Catalan rebels, the CNT's Catalan Regional Committee
issued a clandestine leaflet that stated that the CNT *"must enter the
battle in a manner consistent with its revolutionary anarchist
principles . . . The revolt which broke out this morning must acquire
the characteristics of a popular act through the actions of the
proletariat . . . We demand the right to intervene in this struggle and
we will take this."* A leaflet had to be issued as **Solidaridad
Obrera** was several hours late in appearing due censorship by the
Catalan state. The workers had tried to open their union halls (all CNT
union buildings had been closed by the Catalan government since the CNT
revolt of December 1933) because the CNT's leaflet had called for the
*"[i]mmediate opening of our union buildings and the concentration of
the workers on those premises."* [quoted by Peirats, **The CNT in the
Spanish Revolution**, vol. 1, p. 85] The participation of the CNT in the
revolt as an organised force was something the Catalan rebels refused to
allow and so they fired on workers trying to open their union buildings.
Indeed, after shutting down **Solidaridad Obrera**, the police then
tried to break up the CNT's regional plenum that was then in session,
but fortunately it was meeting on different premises and so they failed.
[Peirats, **Op. Cit.**, pp. 85-6]

Juan Gomez Casas argues that:

> *"The situation [in October 1934] was especially difficult in
> Catalonia. The Workers' Alliance . . . declared a general strike. Luis
> Companys, president of the Catalan Parliament, proclaimed the Catalan
> State within the Spanish Federal Republic . . . But at the same time,
> militants of the CNT and the FAI were arrested . . . **Solidaridad
> Obrera** was censored. The Catalan libertarians understood that the
> Catalan nationalists had two objectives in mind: to oppose the central
> government and to destroy the CNT. Jose Dencas, Counsellor of Defence,
> issued a strict order: 'Watch out for the FAI' . . . Luis Companys
> broadcast a message on October 5 to all 'citizens regardless of
> ideology.' However, many anarchosyndicalist militants were held by his
> deputy, Dencas, in the underground cells of police headquarters."*
> [**Op. Cit.**, pp. 151-2]

Hence the paradoxical situation in which the anarchists,
anarcho-syndicalists and FAI members found themselves in during this
time. The uprising was organised by Catalan fascists who continued to
direct their blows against the CNT. As Abel Paz argues, *"[f]or the rank
and file Catalan worker . . . the insurgents . . . were actually
orienting their action in order to destroy the CNT. After that, how
could they collaborate with the reactionary movement which was directing
its blows against the working class? Here was the paradox of the Catalan
uprising of October 6, 1934."* [**Durruti: The People Armed**, p. 158]

In other words, during the Catalan revolt, *"the CNT had a difficult
time because the insurgents were its worst enemies."* [Peirats, **The
Anarchists in the Spanish Revolution**, p. 98] However, the complexity
of the actual situation does not bother the reader of Morrow's work as
it is not reported. Little wonder, as Peirats argues, the *"absurd
contention according to which the confederal proletariat of Catalonia
betrayed their brethren in Asturias melts away in the face of a truthful
narration of the facts."* [**The CNT in the Spanish Revolution**, vol.
1, p. 86]

In summary, therefore, Morrow expected the membership of the Catalan CNT
and FAI to join in a struggle started and directed by Catalan fascists,
whose leaders in the government were arresting and shooting their
members, censoring their press, closing their union offices and refusing
them a role in the revolt as self-organised forces. We think that sums
up the validity of Trotskyism as a revolutionary theory quite well.

In Madrid, the revolt was slightly less farcical. Here the CNT joined
the general strike. However, the UGT gave the government 24 hours notice
of the general strike, allowing the state to round up the Socialist
"leaders," seize arm depots and repress the insurrection before it got
started [Morrow, **Op. Cit.**, p. 30]. As Bookchin argues, the *"massive
strike in Madrid, which was supported by the entire left, foundered for
want of arms and a revolutionary sense of direction."* [**Op. Cit.**, p.
245] He continues:

> *"As usual, the Socialists emerged as unreliable allies of the
> Anarchists. A revolutionary committee, established by the CNT and FAI
> to co-ordinate their own operations, was denied direly needed weapons
> by the UGT. The arms, as it turned out, had been conveniently
> intercepted by government troops. But even if they had been available,
> it is almost certain that the Socialists would not have shared them
> with the Anarchists. Indeed, relationships between the two major
> sectors of the labour movement had already been poisoned by the
> failure of the Socialist Youth and the UGT to keep the CNT adequately
> informed of their plans or confer with Anarchosyndicalist delegates.
> Despite heavy fighting in Madrid, the CNT and FAI were obliged to
> function largely on their own. When, at length, a UGT delegate
> informed the revolutionary committee that Largo Caballero was not
> interested in common action with the CNT, the committee disbanded."*
> [**Op. Cit.**, p. 246]

Bookchin correctly states that *"Abad de Santillan was to observe with
ample justification that Socialist attempts to blame the failure of the
October Insurrection on Anarchist abstention was a shabby falsehood"*
and quotes Santillan:

> *"Can there be talk of abstention of the CNT and censure of it by
> those who go on strike without warning our organisation about it, who
> refuse to meet with the delegates of the National Committee [of the
> CNT], who consent to let the Lerrous-Gil Robles Government take
> possession of the arms deposits and let them go unused before handing
> them over to the Confederation and the FAI?"* [**Ibid.**]

Historian Paul Preston confirms that in Madrid *"Socialists and
Anarchists went on strike . . ."* and that *"the Socialists actually
rejected the participation of Anarchist and Trotskyist groups who
offered to help make a revolutionary coup in Madrid."* [**The Coming of
the Spanish Civil War**, p. 174] Moreover, *"when delegates travelled
secretly to Madrid to try to co-ordinate support for the revolutionary
Asturian miners, they were rebuffed by the UGT leadership."* [Graham
Kelsey, **Anarchism in Aragon**, p. 73]

Therefore, in two of the three centres of the revolt, the uprising was
badly organised. In Catalonia, the revolt was led by fascist Catalan
Nationalists who arrested and shot at CNT militants. In Madrid, the CNT
backed the strike and was ignored by the Socialists. The revolt itself
was badly organised and quickly repressed (thanks, in part, to the
actions of the Socialists themselves). Little wonder Peirats asks:

> *"Although it seems absurd, one constantly has to ask whether the
> Socialists meant to start a true revolution [in October 1934] in
> Spain. If the answer is affirmative, the questions keep coming: Why
> did they not make the action a national one? Why did they try to do it

> revolutionary? Was what happened in Asturias expected, or were orders
> exceeded? Did they mean only to scare the Radical-CEDA government with
> their action?"* [**The Anarchists in the Spanish Revolution**, pp
> 95-6]

The only real centre of resistance was in Asturias (on the Spanish north
coast). Here, the CNT had joined the Socialists and Communists in a
"Workers Alliance". But, against the alliance's terms, the Socialists
alone gave the order for the uprising -- and the Socialist-controlled
Provincial Committee starved the CNT of arms. This despite the CNT
having over 22 000 affiliates in the area (to the UGT's 40 000). We
discuss the activities of the CNT during the revolt in Asturias later
(in [section 20](append32.html#app20)) and so will do so here.

Morrow states that the *"backbone of the struggle was broken . . . when
the refusal of the CNT railroad workers to strike enabled the government
to transport goods and troops."* [Morrow, **Op. Cit.**, p. 30] Yet in
Asturias (the only area where major troop transportation was needed) the
main government attack was from a sea borne landing of Foreign Legion
and Moroccan troops - against the port and CNT stronghold (15 000
affiliates) of Gijon (and, we must stress, the Socialists and Communists
refused to provide the anarchists of these ports with weapons to resist
the troop landings). Hence his claim seems somewhat at odds with the
actual events of the October uprising.

Moreover, he seems alone in this claim. No other historian (for example,
Hugh Thomas in **The Spanish Civil War**, Raymond Carr in **Spain:
1808-1975**, Paul Preston in **The Coming of the Spanish Civil War**,
Gerald Brenan, **The Spanish Labyrinth**, Gabriel Jackson, **The Spanish
Republic and the Civil War: 1931-1939**) makes this claim. But, of
course, these are not Trotskyists and so can be ignored. However, for
objective readers such an omission might be significant.

Indeed, when these other historians **do** discuss the crushing of the
Asturias they all stress the fact that the troops came from the sea. For
example, Paul Preston notes that *"[w]ith CEDA approval, Franco . . .
insisted on the use of troops from Africa . . . they shipped Moorish
mercenaries to Asturias."* [**The Coming of the Spanish Civil War**, p.
177] Gabriel Jackson argues that the government *"feared to send in the
regular Army because of the strong possibility that the Spanish
conscripts would refuse to fire on the revolutionaries -- or even desert
to them. The War Minister . . . , acting on the advice of Generals
Franco and Goded, sent in contingents of the Morrish **regulares** and
of the Foreign Legions."* These troops arrived *"at the ports of Aviles
and Gijon."* [**The Spanish Republic and the Civil War: 1931-1939**, p.
157]

Richard A. H. Robinson argues that it *"was soon decided that the
[Asturias] rebellion could only be crushed by experienced, professional
troops. The other areas of Spain could not be denuded of their garrisons
in case there were other revolutionary outbreaks. Franco therefore
called upon Colonel Yague to lead a force of Moorish regulars to help
re-conquer the province from the rebels."* [**The Origins of Franco's
Spain**, pp. 190-1] Stanley G. Payne gives a more detailed account of
the state's attack:

> *"Army reinforcements were soon being rushed toward the region . . .
> Eduardo Lopez Ochoa . . . head[ed] the main relief column . . . he
> began to make his way eastward [from Galicia] with a modest force of
> some 360 troops in trucks, half of whom had to be detached on the way
> to hold the route open. Meanwhile . . . in the main Asturian coastal
> city of Gijon . . . reinforcements first arrived by sea on the
> seventh, followed by larger units from the Moroccan Protectorate on
> the tenth."* [**Spain's First Democracy**, p. 219]

No mention of trains in these accounts, so indicating that Morrow's
assertions are false. The main attack on Asturias, and so the
transportation of troops and goods, was by ***sea***, not by trains.

In addition, these historians point to other reasons for the defeat of
the revolt -- the amazingly bad organisation of it by the Socialist
Party. Raymond Carr sums up the overwhelming opinion of the historians
when he says that *"[a]s a national movement the revolution was a
fiasco."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 633] Hugh Thomas states that the revolt in
Catalonia was *"crushed nearly as quickly as the general strike had been
in Madrid."* [**The Spanish Civil War**, p. 136] Brenan correctly argues
that *"[f]rom the moment that Barcelona capitulated and the rising in
Madrid fizzled out, the miners were of course doomed."* [**Op. Cit.**,
p. 286] The failure of both these revolts was directly attributable to
the policies and actions of the Socialists who controlled the *"Workers'
Alliances"* in both areas. Hence historian Paul Heywood:

> *"[A]n important factor which contributed to the strikes' collapse and
> made the state's task easier was the underlying attitude of the
> Socialists. For all the talk of united action by the Left, the
> Socialists still wished to dominate any combined moves. Unwilling to
> cede its traditional hegemony, the PSOE rendered the Alianze obrera
> necessarily ineffective . . .*
> "Thus, there was little genuine unity on the Spanish Left. Moreover,
> the strike was very poorly planned. Differences within the PSOE meant
> that there was no agreement even as to the programme of the strike.
> For the . . . leftists, it represented the initiation of a full-scale
> Socialist revolution; for . . . the centrists in the party, the aim of
> the strike was to force Alcala-Zamora to reconsider and invite the
> Socialists back into a coalition government with the Republicans."
> [**Marxism and the Failure of Organised Socialism in Spain 1879-1936**
> pp. 144-5]

Significantly, Heywood argues that *"[o]ne thing, however, did emerge
from the October strike. The example of Asturias provided a pointed
lesson for the Left: crucially, the key to the relative success of the
insurrection there was the participation of the CNT in an effective
Alianza obrera. Without the CNT, the Asturian rising would have been as
short-lived and as easily defeated as those in Madrid and Barcelona."*
[**Op. Cit.**, p. 145]

Having discussed both Madrid and Barcelona above, we leave it to the
reader to conclude whether Morrow's comments are correct or whether a
more likely alternative explanation for the revolt's failure is
possible.

However, even assuming Morrow's claims that the failure of the CNT rail
workers' union to continue striking in the face of a completely farcical
"revolt" played a key role in its defeat were true, it does not explain
many facts. Firstly, the government had declared martial law -- placing
the railway workers in a dangerous position. Secondly, as Jerome R.
Mintz points out, railway workers *"were represented by two competing
unions -- the Sindicato Nacional Ferroviario of the UGT . . . and the
CNT-affiliated FNIFF . . . The UGT . . . controlled the large majority
of the workers. [In 1933] Trifon Gomez, secretary of the UGT union, did
not believe it possible to mobilise the workers, few of whom had
revolutionary aspirations."* [**The Anarchists of Casa Viejas**, p. 178]
Outside of Catalonia, the majority of the railway workers belonged to
the UGT [Sam Dolgoff, **The Anarchist Collectives**, p. 90f] Asturias
(the only area where major troop transportation was needed) does not
border Catalonia -- apparently the army managed to cross Spain on a rail
network manned by a minority of its workers.

However, these points are of little import when compared to the fact
that Asturias the main government attack was, as we mentioned above,
from a sea borne landing of Foreign Legion and Moroccan troops. Troops
from Morocco who land by sea do not need trains. Indeed, The ports of
Aviles and Gijon were the principle military bases for launching the
repression against the uprising.

The real failure of the Asturias revolt did not lie with the CNT, it lay
(unsurprisingly enough) with the Socialists and Communists. Despite CNT
pleas the Socialists refused arms, Gjon fell after a bloody struggle and
became the main base for the crushing of the entire region (*"Arriving
at the ports of Aviles and Gijon on October 8, these troops were able to
overcome the resistance of the local fishermen and stevedores. The
revolutionary committees here were Anarchist dominated. Though they had
joined the rising and accepted the slogan UHP [Unity, Proletarian
Brothers], the Socialists and Communists of Oviedo clearly distrusted
them and had refused arms to their delegate the day before."* [Gabriel
Jackson, **Op. Cit.**, p. 157]).

This Socialist and Communist sabotage of Anarchist resistance was
repeated in the Civil War, less than two years later.

As can be seen, Morrow's account of the October Insurrection of 1934
leaves a lot to be desired. The claim that the CNT was responsible for
its failure cannot withstand a close examination of the events. Indeed,
by providing the facts which Morrow does not provide we can safely say
that the failure of the revolt across Spain rested squarely with the
PSOE and UGT. It was badly organised, they failed to co-operate or even
communicate with CNT when aid was offered, they relied upon the enemies
of the CNT in Catalonia and refused arms to the CNT in both Madrid and
Asturias (so allowing the government force, the main force of which
landed by sea, easy access to Asturias). All in all, even if the
minority of railway workers in the CNT had joined the strike it would
have, in all probability, resulted in the same outcome.

Unfortunately, Morrow's assertions have become commonplace in the ranks
of the Left and have become even more distorted in the hands of his
Trotskyist readers. For example, we find Nick Wrack arguing that the
*"Socialist Party called a general strike and there were insurrectionary
movements in Asturias and Catalonia, In Madrid and Catalonia the
anarchist CNT stood to one side, arguing that this was a 'struggle
between politicians' and did not concern the workers even though this
was a strike against a move to incorporate fascism into the
government."* He continues, *"[i]n Asturias the anarchist militants
participated under the pressure of the masses and because of the
traditions of unity in that area. However, because of their
abstentionist stupidity, the anarchists elsewhere continued to work,
even working trains which brought the Moorish troops under Franco to
suppress the Asturias insurrection."* [*"Marxism, Anarchism and the
State"*, pp. 31-7, **Militant International Review**, no. 46, p. 34]

Its hard to work out where to start in this travesty of history. We will
start with the simple errors. The CNT **did** take part in the struggle
in Madrid. As Paul Preston notes, in Madrid the *"Socialists and
Anarchists went on strike"* [**The Coming of the Spanish Civil War**, p.
174] In Catalonia, as indicated above, the "insurrectionary movement" in
Catalonia was organised and lead by Catalan Fascists, who shot upon CNT
members when they tried to open their union halls and who arrested CNT
and FAI militants the night before the uprising. Moreover, the people
organising the revolt had been repressing the CNT for months previously.
Obviously attempts by Catalan Fascists to become a government should be
supported by socialists, including Trotskyists. Moreover, the UGT and
PSOE had worked with the quasi-fascist Primo do Rivera dictatorship
during the 1920s. The hypocrisy is clear. So much for the CNT standing
*"to one side, arguing that this was a 'struggle between politicians'
and did not concern the workers even though this was a strike against a
move to incorporate fascism into the government."*

His comments that *"the anarchists . . . work[ed] trains which brought
the Moorish troops under Franco to suppress the Asturias insurrection"*
is just plain silly. It was **not** anarchists who ran the trains, it
was railway workers -- under martial law -- some of whom were in the CNT
and some of whom were anarchists. Moreover, as noted above the Moorish
troops under Franco arrived **by sea** and not by train. And, of course,
no mention of the fact that the CNT-FAI in the strategically key port of
Gijon was denied arms by the Socialists and Communists, which allowed
the Moorish troops to disembark without real resistance.

Morrow has a lot to answer for.

7. Were the Friends of Durruti Marxists?
----------------------------------------

It is sometimes claimed that the **Friends of Durruti** Group which
formed during the Spanish Revolution were Marxists or represented a
"break" with anarchism and a move towards Marxism. Both these assertions
are false. We discuss whether the Friends of Durruti (FoD) represented a
"break" with anarchism in the [following section](append32.html#app8).
Here we indicate that claims of the FoD being Marxists are false.

The Friends of Durruti were formed, in March 1937, by anarchist
militants who had refused to submit to Communist-controlled
"militarisation" of the workers' militias. During the Maydays -- the
government attack against the revolution two months later -- the Friends
of Durruti were notable for their calls to stand firm and crush the
counter-revolution. During and after the May Days, the leaders of the
CNT asserted that the FoD were Marxists (which was quite ironic as it
was the CNT leaders who were acting as Marxists in Spain usually did by
joining with bourgeois governments). This was a slander, pure and
simple.

The best source to refute claims that the FoD were Marxists (or becoming
Marxist) or that they were influenced by, or moved towards, the
Bolshevik-Leninists is Agustin Guillamon's book **The Friends of Durruti
Group: 1937-1939**. Guillamon is a Marxist (of the "left-communist"
kind) and no anarchist (indeed he states that the *"Spanish Revolution
was the tomb of anarchism as a revolutionary theory of the
proletariat."* [p. 108]). That indicates that his account can be
considered objective and not anarchist wishful thinking. Here we use his
work to refute the claims that the FoD were Marxists. [Section
9](append32.html#app9) discusses their links (or lack of them) with the
Spanish Trotskyists.

So were the FoD Marxists? Guillamon makes it clear -- no, they were not.
In his words, *"[t]here is nothing in the Group's theoretical tenets,
much less in the columns of **El Amigo del Pueblo** [their newspaper],
or in their various manifestos and handbills to merit the description
'marxist' being applied to the Group [by the CNT leadership]. They were
simply an opposition to the CNT's leadership's collaborationist policy,
making their stand within the organisation and upon anarcho-syndicalist
ideology."* [p. 61] He stresses this in his conclusion:

> *"The Friends of Durruti was an affinity group, like many another
> existing in anarcho-syndicalist quarters. It was not influenced to any
> extent by the Trotskyists, nor by the POUM. Its ideology and
> watchwords were quintessentially in the CNT idiom: it cannot be said
> that they displayed a marxist ideology at any time . . . They were
> against the abandonment of revolutionary objectives and of anarchism's
> fundamental and quintessential ideological principles, which the
> CNT-FAI leaders had thrown over in favour of anti-fascist unity and
> the need to adapt to circumstances."* [p. 107]

In other words, they wanted to return the CNT *"to its class struggle
roots."* [**Ibid.**] Indeed, Balius (a leading member of the group and
writer of its 1938 pamphlet **Towards a Fresh Revolution**) was moved to
challenge the charges of "marxist" levelled at him:

> *"I will not repay defamatory comment in kind. But what I cannot keep
> mum about is that a legend of marxism has been woven about my person
> and I should like the record put straight . . . It grieves me that at
> the present time there is somebody who dares call me a Marxist when I
> could refute with unanswerable arguments those who hang such an
> unjustified label on me. As one who attends our union assemblies and
> specific gatherings, I might speak of the loss of class sensibility
> which I have observed on a number of occasions. I have heard it said

> call upon all the comrades who have used the press to hang this label
> upon me to spell out what makes me a marxist."* [**El Amigo del
> Pueblo**, no. 4, p. 3]

As can be seen, the FoD were not Marxists. Two more questions arise.
Were they a "break" with anarchism (i.e. moving towards Marxism) and
were they influenced by the Spanish Trotskyists. We turn to these
questions in the next two sections.

8. Did the Friends of Durruti *"break with"* anarchism?
-------------------------------------------------------

Morrow claims that the Friends of Durruti (FoD) *"represented a
conscious break with the anti-statism of traditional anarchism. They
explicitly declared the need for democratic organs of power, juntas or
soviets, in the overthrow of capitalism."* [Morrow, **Op. Cit.**, p.
247] The truth of the matter is somewhat different.

Before discussing his assertion in more detail a few comments are
required. Typically, in Morrow's topsy-turvy world, all anarchists like
the Friends of Durruti (Morrow also includes the Libertarian Youth, the
*"politically awakened"* CNT rank and file, local FAI groups, etc.) who
remained true to anarchism and stuck to their guns (often literally) --
represented a break with anarchism and a move towards Marxism, the
revolutionary vanguard party (no doubt part of the 4th International),
and a fight for the "workers state." Those anarchists, on the other
hand, who compromised for "anti-fascist unity" (but mainly to try and
get weapons to fight Franco) are the real anarchists because *"class
collaboration . . . lies concealed in the heart of anarchist
philosophy."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 101]

Morrow, of course, would have had a fit if anarchists pointed to the
example of the Social Democrat's who crushed the German Revolution or
Stalin's Russia as examples that "rule by an elite lies concealed in the
heart of Marxist philosophy." It does not spring into Morrow's mind that
those anarchists he praises are the ones who show the revolutionary
heart of anarchism. This can best be seen from his comments on the
Friends of Durruti, who we argue were not evolving towards "Marxism" but
rather were trying to push the CNT and FAI back to its pre-Civil War
politics and strategy. Moreover, as we argue in [section
12](append32.html#app12), anarchism has always argued for self-managed
working class organisations to carry out and defend a revolution. The
FoD were simply following in the tradition founded by Bakunin.

In other words, we will show that they did not *"break with"* anarchism
-- rather they refused to compromise their anarchism in the face of
"comrades" who thought winning the war meant entering the government.
This is clear from their leaflets, paper and manifesto. Moreover, as
will become obvious, their "break" with anarchism actually just restates
pre-war CNT policy and organisation.

For example, their leaflets, in April 1937, called for the unions and
municipalities to *"replace the state"* and for no retreat:

> *"We have the organs that must supplant a State in ruins. The Trade
> Unions and Municipalities must take charge of economic and social
> life."* [quoted by Agustin Guillamon, **Op. Cit.**, p. 38]

This clearly is within the CNT and anarcho-syndicalist tradition. Their
manifesto, in 1938, repeated this call (*"the state cannot be retained
in the face of the unions"*), and made three demands as part of their
programme. It is worth quoting these at length:

> *"I - Establishment of a Revolutionary Junta or National Defence
> Council.*
>
> "This body will be organised as follows: members of the revolutionary
> Junta will be elected by democratic vote in the union organisations.
> Account is to be taken of the number of comrades away at the front . .
> . The Junta will steer clear of economic affairs, which are the
> exclusive preserve of the unions.
>
> "The functions of the revolutionary Junta are as follows:
>
> "Posts to come up regularly for re-allocation so as to prevent anyone
> growing attached to them. And the trade union assemblies will exercise
> control over the Junta's activities.
>
> "II - All economic power to the syndicates.
>
> "Since July the unions have supplied evidence of the great capacity
> for constructive labour. . . It will be the unions that structure the
> proletarian economy.
>
> "An Economic Council may also be set up, taking into consideration the
> natures of the Industrial Unions and Industrial federations, to
> improve on the co-ordination of economic activities.
>
> "III - Free municipality.
>
> [...]
>
> "The Municipality shall take charge of those functions of society that
> fall outside the preserve of the unions. And since the society we are
> going to build shall be composed exclusively of producers, it will be
> the unions, no less, that will provide sustenance for the
> municipalities. . .
>
> "The Municipalities will be organised at the level of local, comarcal
> and peninsula federations. Unions and municipalities will maintain
> liaison at local, comarcal and national levels." [**Towards a Fresh
> Revolution**]

This programme basically mimics the pre-war CNT policy and organisation
and so cannot be considered as a *"break"* with anarchist or CNT
politics or tradition.

Firstly, we should note that the *"municipality"* was a common CNT
expression to describe a *"commune"* which was considered as *"all the
residents of a village or hamlet meeting in assembly (council) with full
powers to administer and order local affairs, primarily production and
distribution."* In the cities and town the equivalent organisation was
*"the union"* which *"brings individuals together, grouping them
according to the nature of their work . . . First, it groups the workers
of a factory, workshop or firm together, this being the smallest cell
enjoying autonomy with regard to whatever concerns it alone . . . The
local unions federate with one another, forming a local federation,
composed of the committee elected by the unions, and of the general
assembly that, in the last analysis, holds supreme sovereignty."* [Issac
Puente, **Libertarian Communism**, p. 25 and p. 24]

In addition, the *"national federations [of unions] will hold as common
property the roads, railways, buildings, equipment, machinery and
workshops"* and the *"free municipality will federate with its
counterparts in other localities and with the national industrial
federations."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 29 and p. 26] Thus Puente's classic
pre-war pamphlet is almost identical to points two and three of the FoD
Programme.

Moreover, the *"Economic Council"* urged by the FoD in point two of
their programme is obviously inspired by the work of Abad Diego de
Santillan, particularly his book **After the Revolution** (**El
Organismo Economico de la Revolucion**). Discussing the role of the
*"Federal Council of Economy"*, de Santillan says that it *"receives its
orientation from below and operates in accordance with the resolutions
of the regional and national assemblies."* [p. 86] Just as the CNT
Congresses were the supreme policy-making body in the CNT itself, they
envisioned a similar body emanating from the rank-and-file assemblies to
make the guiding decisions for a socialised economy.

This leaves point one of their programme, the call for a *"Revolutionary
Junta or National Defence Council."* It is here that Morrow and a host
of other Marxists claim the FoD broke with anarchism towards Marxism.
Nothing could be further from the truth.

Firstly, anarchists have long supported the idea of workers' councils
(or soviets) as an expression of working class power to control their
own lives (and so society) -- indeed, far longer than Marxists. Thus we
find Bakunin arguing that the *"future social organisation must be made
solely from the bottom up, by the free association or federation of
workers, firstly in their unions, then in the communes, regions, nations
and finally in a great federation, international and universal."*
Anarchists *"attain this goal . . . by the development and organisation,
not of the political but of the social (and, by consequence,
anti-political) power of the working masses."* [**Michael Bakunin:
Selected Writings**, p. 206 and p. 198] These councils of workers'
delegates (workers' councils) would be the basis of the commune and
defence of the revolution:

> *"the federative Alliance of all working men's associations . . .
> constitute the Commune . . .. Commune will be organised by the
> standing federation of the Barricades. . . [T]he federation of
> insurgent associations, communes and provinces . . . [would] organise
> a revolutionary force capable of defeating reaction . . . it is the
> very fact of the expansion and organisation of the revolution for the
> purpose of self-defence among the insurgent areas that will bring
> about the triumph of the revolution."* [**Op. Cit.**, pp. 170-1]

This perspective can be seen in the words of the German
anarcho-syndicalist H. Ruediger (member of the IWA's secretariat in
1937) when he argued that for anarchists *"social re-organisation, like
the defence of the revolution, should be concentrated in the hands of
**working class organisations** -- whether labour unions or new organs
of spontaneous creation, such as free councils, etc., which, as an
expression of the will of the workers themselves, from **below up**,
should construct the revolutionary social community."* [quoted in **The
May Days in Barcelona**, Vernon Richards (ed.), p. 71]

Camillo Berneri sums up the anarchist perspective clearly when he wrote:

> *"The Marxists . . . foresee the natural disappearance of the State as
> a consequence of the destruction of classes by the means of 'the
> dictatorship of the proletariat,' that is to say State Socialism,
> whereas the Anarchists desire the destruction of the classes by means
> of a social revolution which eliminates, with the classes, the State.
> The Marxists, moreover, do not propose the armed conquest of the
> Commune by the whole proletariat, but the propose the conquest of the
> State by the party which imagines that it represents the proletariat.
> The Anarchists allow the use of direct power by the proletariat, but
> they understand by the organ of this power to be formed by the entire
> corpus of systems of communist administration -- corporate
> organisations [i.e. industrial unions], communal institutions, both
> regional and national -- freely constituted outside and in opposition
> to all political monopoly by parties and endeavouring to a minimum
> administrational centralisation."* [*"Dictatorship of the Proletariat
> and State Socialism"*, **Cienfuegos Press Anarchist Review**, no. 4,
> p. 52]

In other words, anarchists **do** support democratic organs of power
when they are **directly** democratic (i.e. self-managed). *"The basic
idea of Anarchism is simple,"* argued Voline, *"no party . . . placed
above or outside the labouring masses . . . ever succeeds in
emancipating them . . . Effective emancipation can only be achieved by
the **direct, widespread, and independent action of those concerned, of
the workers themselves**, grouped, not under the banner of a political
party . . . but in their own class organisations (productive workers'
unions, factory committees, co-operatives, et cetra) on the basis of
concrete action and self-government."* [**The Unknown Revolution**, p,
197]

Anarchists oppose **representative** organs of power as these are
governments and so based on minority power and subject to bureaucratic
deformations which ensure **un**-accountablity from below. Anarchists
argue *"that, by its very nature, political power could not be exercised
except by a very restricted group of men at the centre. Therefore this
power -- the **real** power -- could not belong to the soviets. It would
actually be in the hands of the party."* [Voline, **Op. Cit.**, p. 213]

Thus Morrow's argument is flawed on the basic point that he does not
understand anarchist theory or the nature of an anarchist revolution
(also see [section 12](append32.html#app12)).

Secondly, and more importantly given the Spanish context, the FoD's
vision has a marked similarity to pre-Civil War CNT organisation, policy
and vision. This means that the idea of a National Defence Council was
not the radical break with the CNT that some claim. Before the civil war
the CNT had long has its defence groups, federated at regional and
national level. Historian Jerome Mintz provides a good summary:

> *"The policies and actions of the CNT were conducted primarily by
> administrative juntas, beginning with the sindicato, whose junta
> consisted of a president, secretary, treasurer, and council members.
> At each step in the confederation, a representative [sic! -- delegate]
> was sent to participate at the next organisational level -- from
> sindicato to the district to the regional confederation, then to the
> national confederation. In addition to the juntas, however, there were
> two major committee systems established as adjuncts to the juntas that
> had developed some autonomy: the **comites pro presos**, or committees
> for political prisoners, which worked for the release of prisoners and
> raised money for the relief of their families; and the **comites de
> defensa**, or defence committees, whose task was to stockpile weapons
> for the coming battle and to organise the shock troops who would bear
> the brunt of the fighting."* [**The Anarchists of Casas Viejas**, p.
> 141]

Thus we see that the CNT had its *"juntas"* (which means council or
committee and so does not imply any authoritarianism) as well as
*"defence committees"* which were elected by democratic vote in the
union organisations decades before the FoD existed. The Defence
Committees (or councils) were a CNT insurgent agency in existence well
before July 1936 and had, in fact, played a key role in many
insurrections and strikes, including the events of July 1936. In other
words, the *"break"* with anarchism Morrow presents was, in fact, an
exact reproduction of the way the CNT had traditionally operated and
acted -- it is the same program of a *"workers defence council"* and
*"union management of the economy"* that the CNT had advocated prior to
the outbreak of the Civil War. The only *"break"* that **did** occur
post 19th of July was that of the CNT and FAI ignoring its politics and
history in favour of "anti-fascist unity" and a UGT "Workers' Alliance"
with all anti-fascist unions and parties (see [section
20](append32.html#app20)).

Moreover, the CNT insurrection of December 1933 had been co-ordinated by
a National Revolutionary Committee [**No Gods, No Masters**, vol. 2, p.
235]. D.A. Santillan argued that the *"local Council of Economy will
assume the mission of defence and raise voluntary corps for guard duty
and if need be, for combat"* in the *"cases of emergency or danger of a
counter-revolution."* [**After the Revolution**, p. 80] During the war
itself a CNT national plenum of regions, in September 1936, called for a
National Defence Council, with majority union representation and based
on Regional Defence Councils. The Defence Council of Aragon, set up soon
after, was based on these ideas. The need for co-ordinated revolutionary
defence and attack is just common sense -- and had been reflected in CNT
theory, policy and structure for decades.

An understanding of the basic ideas of anarchist theory on revolution
combined with the awareness of the CNT's juntas (administrative councils
or committees) had *"defence committees"* associated with them makes it
extremely clear that rather than being a *"conscious break with the
anti-statism of traditional anarchism"* the FoD's programme was, in
fact, a conscious **return** to the anti-statism of traditional
anarchism and the revolutionary program and vision of the pre-Civil War
CNT.

This is confirmed if we look at the activities of the CNT in Aragon
where they formed the *"Defence Council of Aragon"* in September 1936.
In the words of historian Antony Beevor, *"[i]n late September delegates
from the Aragonese collectives attended a conference at Bujaraloz, near
where Durruti's column was based. They decided to establish a Defence
Council of Aragon, and elected as president Joaquin Ascaso."* [**Op.
Cit.**, p. 96] In February 1937, the first congress of the regional
federation of collectives was held at Caspe to co-ordinate the
activities of the collectives -- an obvious example of a regional
economic council desired by the FoD. Morrow does mention the Council of
Aragon -- *"the anarchist-controlled Council for the Defence of Aragon"*
[**Op. Cit.**, p. 111] -- however, he strangely fails to relate this
fact to anarchist politics. After all, in Aragon the CNT-FAI remained
true to anarchism, created a defence council and a federation of
collectives. If Morrow had discussed the events in Aragon he would have
had to draw the conclusion that the FoD were not a *"conscious break
with the traditional anti-statism of anarchism"* but rather were an
expression of it.

This can be seen from the comments made after the end of the war by the
Franco-Spanish Group of **The Friends of Durruti**. They clearly argued
for a return to the principles of anarchism and the pre-war CNT. They
argued not only for workers' self-organisation and self-management as
the basis of the revolution but also to the pre-war CNT idea of a
workers' alliance from the bottom up rather than a UGT-style one at the
top (see [section 5](append32.html#app5)). In their words:

> *"A revolution requires the absolute domination of the workers'
> organisations as was the case in July, 1936, when the CNT-FAI were
> masters . . . We incline to the view that it is necessary to form a
> Revolutionary Alliance; a Workers' Front; where no one would be
> allowed to enter and take their place except on a revolutionary basis
> . . . "* [**The Friends of Durruti Accuse**]

As can be seen, rather than a "revolutionary government" the FoD were
consistently arguing for a federation of workers' associations as the
basis of the revolution. In this they were loyally following Bakunin's
basic arguments and the ideas of anarchism. Rather than the FoD breaking
with anarchism, it is clear that it was the leading committees of the
CNT and FAI which actually broke with the politics of anarchism and the
tactics, ideas and ideals of the CNT.

Lastly there are the words of Jaime Balius, one of the FoD's main
activists, who states in 1976 that:

> *"We did not support the formation of Soviets; there were no grounds
> in Spain for calling for such. We stood for 'all power to the trade
> unions'. In no way were we politically orientated . . . Ours was
> solely an attempt to save the revolution; at the historical level it
> can be compared to Kronstadt because if there the sailors and workers
> called for 'all power to the Soviets', we were calling for all power
> to the unions."* [quoted by Ronald Fraser, **Blood of Spain**, p. 381]

*"Political"* here meaning "state-political" -- a common anarchist use
of the word. According to Fraser, the *"proposed revolutionary junta was
to be composed of combatants from the barricades."* [**Ibid.**] This
echoes Bakunin's comment that the *"Commune will be organised by the
standing federation of the Barricades and by the creation of a
Revolutionary Communal Council composed of one or two delegates from
each barricade . . . vested with plenary but accountable and removable
mandates."* [**Op. Cit.**, pp. 170-1]

As can be seen, rather than calling for power to a party or looking to
form a government (i.e. being *"politically orientated"*) the FoD were
calling for *"all power to the unions."* This meant, in the context of
the CNT, all power to the union assemblies in the workplace. Decision
making would flow from the bottom upwards rather than being delegated to
a "revolutionary" government as in Trotskyism. To stress the point, the
FoD did not represent a *"break"* with anarchism or the CNT tradition.
To claim otherwise means to misunderstand anarchist politics and CNT
history.

Our analysis, we must note, also makes a mockery of Guillamon's claim
that because the FoD thought that libertarian communism had to be
*"impose[d]"* and *"defended by force of arms"* their position
represented an *"evolution within anarchist thought processes."* [**Op.
Cit.**, p. 95] As has been made clear above, from Bakunin onwards
revolutionary anarchism has been aware of the need for an insurrection
to create an anarchist society by destroying both the state and
capitalism (i.e. to *"impose"* a free society upon those who wish
hierarchy to continue and are in a position of power) and for that
revolution to be defended against attempts to defeat it. Similarly, his
claim that the FoD's *"revolutionary junta"* was the equivalent of what
*"others call the vanguard or the revolutionary party"* cannot be
defended given our discussion above -- it is clear that the junta was
not seen as a form of delegated power by rather as a means of defending
the revolution like the CNT's defence committees and under the direct
control of the union assemblies.

It may be argued that the FoD did not actually mean this sort of
structure. Indeed, their manifesto states that they are *"introducing a
slight variation in anarchism into our program. The establishment of a
Revolutionary Junta."* Surely this implies that they saw themselves as
having moved away from anarchism and CNT policy? As can be seen from
Balius' comments during and after the revolution, the FoD were arguing
for *"all power to the unions"* and stating that *"apolitical anarchism
had failed."* However, *"apolitical"* anarchism came about post-July
19th when the CNT-FAI (ignoring anarchist theory and CNT policy and
history) **ignored** the state machine rather than destroying it and
supplanting it with libertarian organs of self-management. The social
revolution that spontaneously occurred after July 19th was essentially
economic and social (i.e. *"apolitical"*) and not *"anti-political"*
(i.e. the destruction of the state machine). Such a revolution would
soon come to grief on the shores of the (revitalised) state machine --
as the FoD correctly argued had happened.

To state that they had introduced a variation into their anarchism makes
sense post-July 1936. The *"apolitical"* line of the CNT-FAI had
obviously failed and a new departure was required. While it is clear
that the FoD's "new" position was nothing of the kind, it was elemental
anarchist principles, it was "new" in respect to the policy the CNT
("anarchism") had conducted during the Civil War -- a policy they
justified by selective use of anarchist theory and principles. In the
face of this, the FoD could claim they were presenting a new variation
in spite of its obvious similarities to pre-war CNT policies and
anarchist theory. Thus the claim that the FoD saw their ideas as some
sort of departure from traditional anarchism cannot be maintained, given
the obvious links this "new" idea had with the past policies and
structure of the CNT. As Guillamon makes it clear, the FoD made *"their
stand within the organisation and upon anarcho-syndicalist ideology"*
and *"[a]t all times the Group articulated an anarcho-syndicalist
ideology, although it also voiced radical criticism of the CNT and FAI
leadership. But it is a huge leap from that to claiming that the Group
espoused marxist positions."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 61 and p. 95]

One last comment. Morrow states that the *"CNT leadership . . . expelled
the Friends of Durruti"* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 189] This is not true. The
CNT leadership did **try** to expel the FoD. However, as Balius points
out, the *"higher committees order[ed] our expulsion, but this was
rejected by the rank and file in the trade union assemblies and at a
plenum of FAI groups held in the Casa CNT-FAI."* [quoted by Agustin
Guillamon, **Op. Cit.**, p. 73] Thus the CNT leadership could never get
their desire ratified by any assembly of unions or FAI groups.
Unfortunately, Morrow gets his facts wrong (and also presents a somewhat
false impression of the relationship of the CNT leadership and the rank
and file).

9. Were the Friends of Durruti influenced by Trotskyists?
---------------------------------------------------------

Morrow implies that the Bolshevik-Leninists *"established close contacts
with the anarchist workers, especially the 'Friends of Durruti'"* [**Op.
Cit.**, p. 139] The truth, as usual, is somewhat different.

To prove this we must again turn to Guillamon's work in which he
dedicates a chapter to this issue. He brings this chapter by stating:

> *"It requires only a cursory perusal of **El Amigo del Pueblo** or
> Balius's statements to establish that the Friends of Durruti were
> never marxists, nor influenced at all by the Trotskyists or the
> Bolshevik-Leninist Section. But there is a school of historians
> determined to maintain the opposite and hence the necessity for this
> chapter."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 94]

He stresses that the FoD *"were not in any way **beholden** to Spanish
Trotskyism is transparent from several documents"* and notes that while
the POUM and Trotskyists displayed *"an interest"* in *"bringing the
Friends of Durruti under their influence"* this was *"something in which
they never succeeded."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 96 and p. 110]

Pre-May, 1937, Balius himself states that the FoD *"had no contact with
the POUM, nor with the Trotskyists."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 104] Post-May,
this had not changed as witness E. Wolf letter to Trotsky in July 1937
which stated that it *"will be impossible to achieve any collaboration
with them . . . Neither the POUMists nor the Friends would agree to the
meeting [to discuss joint action]."* [**Op. Cit.**, pp. 97-8]

In other words, the Friends of Durruti did not establish *"close
contacts"* with the Bolshevik-Leninists after the May Days of 1937.
While the Bolshevik-Leninists may have wished for such contacts, the FoD
did not (they probably remembered their fellow anarchists and workers
imprisoned and murdered when Trotsky was in power in Russia). They were,
of course, contacts of a limited kind but no influence or significant
co-operation. Little wonder Balius stated in 1946 that the *"alleged
influence of the POUM or the Trotskyists upon us is untrue."* [quoted,
**Op. Cit.**, p. 104]

It is hardly surprising that the FoD were not influenced by Trotskyism.
After all, they were well aware of the policies Trotsky introduced when
he was in power. Moreover, the program of the Bolshevik-Leninists was
similar in rhetoric to the anarchist vision -- they differed on the
question of whether they actually **meant** *"all power to the working
class"* or not (see section [12](append32.html#app12) and
[13](append32.html#app13)). And, of course, the Trotskyists activities
during the May Days amounted to little more that demanding that the
workers' do what they were already doing (as can be seen from the
leaflet they produced -- as George Orwell noted, *"it merely demanded
what was happening already"* [**Homage to Catalonia**, p. 221]). As
usual, the "vanguard of the proletariat" were trying to catch up with
the proletariat.

In theory and practice the FoD were miles ahead of the
Bolshevik-Leninists -- as to be expected, as the FoD were anarchists.

10. What does the Friends of Durruti's programme tell us about Trotskyism?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Morrow states that the FoD's *"slogans included the essential points of
a revolutionary program: all power to the working class, and democratic
organs of the workers, peasants and combatants, as the expression of the
workers' power."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 133] It is useful to compare
Leninism to these points to see if that provides a revolutionary
program.

Firstly, as we argue in more detail in [section
11](append32.html#app11), Trotsky abolished the democratic organs of the
Red Army. Lenin's rule also saw the elimination of the factory committee
movement and its replacement with one-man management appointed from
above (see [section 17](append32.html#app17) and Maurice Brinton's **The
Bolsheviks and Workers' Control** for details). Both these events
occurred before the start of the Russian Civil War in May 1918.
Moreover, neither Lenin nor Trotsky considered workers' self-management
of production as a key aspects of socialism. On this level, Leninism in
power did not constitute a *"revolutionary program."*

Secondly, Leninism does **not** call for *"all power to the working
class"* or even *"workers' power"* to manage their own affairs. To quote
Trotsky, in an article written in 1937, *"the proletariat can take power
only through its vanguard."* The working classes' role is one of
supporting the party:

> *"Without the confidence of the class in the vanguard, without support
> of the vanguard by the class, there can be no talk of the conquest of
> power.*
>
> "In this sense the proletarian revolution and dictatorship are the
> work of the whole class, but only under the leadership of the
> vanguard."

Thus, rather than the working class as a whole seizing power, it is the
*"vanguard"* which takes power -- *"a revolutionary party, even after
seizing power . . . is still by no means the sovereign ruler of
society."* [**Stalinism and Bolshevism**] So much for "workers' power"
-- unless you equate that with the "power" to give your power, your
control over your own affairs, to a minority who claim to represent you.
Indeed, Trotsky even attacks the idea that workers' can achieve power
directly via organs of self-management like workers' councils (or
soviets):

> *"Those who propose the abstraction of the Soviets from the party
> dictatorship should understand that only thanks to the party
> dictatorship were the Soviets able to lift themselves out of the mud
> of reformism and attain the state form of the proletariat."* [**Op.
> Cit.**]

In other words, the dictatorship of the proletariat is, in fact,
expressed by *"the party dictatorship."* In this Trotsky follows Lenin
who asserted that:

> *"The very presentation of the question -- 'dictatorship of the Party
> **or** dictatorship of the class, dictatorship (Party) of the leaders
> **or** dictatorship (Party) of the masses?' -- is evidence of the most
> incredible and hopeless confusion of mind . . . [because] classes are
> usually . . . led by political parties. . . "* [**Left-wing Communism:
> An Infantile Disorder**, pp. 25-6]

As has been made clear above, the FoD being anarchists aimed for a
society of generalised self-management, a system in which working people
directly controlled their own affairs and so society. As these words by
Lenin and Trotsky indicate they did not aim for such a society, a
society based on *"all power to the working class."* Rather, they aimed
for a society in which the workers would delegate their power into the
hands of a few, the revolutionary party, who would exercise power **on
their behalf.** The FoD meant exactly what they said when they argued
for *"all power to the working class"* -- they did not mean this as a
euphemism for party rule. In this they followed Bakunin:

> *"[T]he federated Alliance of all labour associations . . . will
> constitute the Commune . . . there will be a federation of the
> standing barricades and a Revolutionary Communal Council will operate
> on the basis of one or two delegates from each barricade . . . these
> deputies being invested with binding mandates and accountable and
> revocable at all times. . . An appeal will be issued to all provinces,
> communes and associations inviting them to follow the example set . .
> . [and] to reorganise along revolutionary lines . . . and to then
> delegate deputies to an agreed place of assembly (all of those
> deputies invested with binding mandates and accountable and subject to
> recall), in order to found the federation of insurgent associations,
> communes and provinces . . . Thus it is through the very act of
> extrapolation and organisation of the Revolution with an eye to the
> mutual defences of insurgent areas that the . . . Revolution, founded
> upon . . . the ruins of States, will emerge triumphant. . .*
>
> "Since it is the people which must make the revolution everywhere, and
> since the ultimate direction of it must at all times be vested in the
> people organised into a free federation of agricultural and industrial
> organisations . . . being organised from the bottom up through
> revolutionary delegation . . ." [**No God, No Masters**, vol. 1, pp.
> 155-6]

And:

> *"Not even as revolutionary transition will we countenance national
> Conventions, nor Constituent Assemblies, nor provisional governments,
> nor so-called revolutionary dictatorships: because we are persuaded
> that revolution s sincere, honest and real only among the masses and
> that, whenever it is concentrated in the hands of a few governing
> individuals, it inevitably and immediately turns into reaction."*
> [**Op. Cit.**, p. 160]

As can be seen, Bakunin's vision is precisely, to use Morrow' words,
*"all power to the working class, and democratic organs of the workers,
peasants and combatants, as the expression of the workers' power."* Thus
the Friends of Durruti's program is not a *"break"* with anarchism (as
we discussed in more detail in [section 8](append32.html#app8)) but
rather in the tradition started by Bakunin -- in other words, an
anarchist program. It is Leninism, as can be seen, which rejects this
*"revolutionary program"* in favour of all power to the representatives
of the working class (i.e. party) which it confuses with the working
class as a whole.

Given that Morrow asserts that *"all power to the working class"* was an
*"essential"* point of *"a revolutionary program"* we can only conclude
that Trotskyism does not provide a revolutionary program -- rather it
provides a program based, at best, on representative government in which
the workers' delegate their power to a minority or, at worse, on party
dictatorship **over** the working class (the experience of Bolshevik
Russia would suggest the former quickly becomes the latter, and is
justified by Bolshevik ideology).

By his own arguments, here as in so many other cases, Morrow indicates
that Trotskyism is not a revolutionary movement or theory.

11. Why is Morrow's comments against the militarisation of the Militias ironic?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Morrow denounces the Stalinist militarisation of the militias (their
*"campaign for wiping out the internal democratic life of the
militias"*) as follows:

> *"The Stalinists early sought to set an 'example' by handing their
> militias over to government control, helping to institute the salute,
> supremacy of officers behind the lines, etc. . .*
>
> "The example was wasted on the CNT masses . . . The POUM reprinted for
> distribution in the militias the original Red Army Manual of Trotsky,
> providing for a democratic internal regime and political life in the
> army." [**Op. Cit.**, p. 126]

Morrow states that he supported the *"democratic election of soldiers'
committees in each unit, centralised in a national election of soldiers'
delegates to a national council."* Moreover, he attacks the POUM
leadership because it *"**forbade** election of soldiers' committees"*
and argued that the *"simple, concrete slogan of elected soldier's
committees was the only road for securing proletariat control of the
army."* He attacks the POUM because its *"ten thousand militiamen were
controlled bureaucratically by officials appointed by the Central
Committee of the party, election of soldiers' committees being expressly
forbidden."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 127, p. 128 and pp. 136-7]

Again, Morrow is correct. A revolutionary working class militia **does**
require self-management, the election of delegates, soldiers' councils
and so on. Bakunin, for example, argued that the fighters on the
barricades would take a role in determining the development of the
revolution as the *"Commune will be organised by the standing federation
of the Barricades . . . composed of one or two delegates from each
barricade . . . vested with plenary but accountable and removable
mandates."* This would complement *"the federative Alliance of all
working men's [and women's] associations . . . which will constitute the
Commune."* [**Michael Bakunin: Selected Writings**, pp. 170-1] That is
**exactly** why the CNT militia organised in this fashion (and, we must
note, they were only applying the organisational principles of the CNT
and FAI -- i.e. anarchism -- to the militias). The militia columns were
organised in a libertarian fashion from the bottom up:

> *"The establishment of war committees is acceptable to all confederal
> militias. We start from the individual and form groups of ten, which
> come to accommodations among themselves for small-scale operations.
> Ten such groups together make up one centuria, which appoints a
> delegate to represent it. Thirty centurias make up one column, which
> is directed by a war committee, on which the delegates from the
> centurias have their say. . . although every column retains its
> freedom of action, we arrive at co-ordination of forces, which is not
> the same thing as unity of command."* [**No Gods, No Masters**, vol.
> 2, pp. 256-7]

In other words, Morrow is arguing for an **anarchist** solution to the
problem of defending the revolution and organising those who were
fighting fascism. We say anarchist for good reason. What is ironic about
Morrow's comments and description of *"workers' control of the army"* is
that these features were **exactly** those eliminated by Trotsky when he
created the Red Army in 1918! Indeed, Trotsky acted in **exactly** the
same way as Morrow attacks the Stalinists for acting (and they used many
of the same arguments as Trotsky did to justify it).

As Maurice Brinton correctly summarises:

> *"Trotsky, appointed Commissar of Military Affairs after
> Brest-Litovsk, had rapidly been reorganising the Red Army. The death
> penalty for disobedience under fire had been restored. So, more
> gradually, had saluting, special forms of address, separate living
> quarters and other privileges for officers. Democratic forms of
> organisation, including the election of officers, had been quickly
> dispensed with."* [**The Bolsheviks and Workers' Control**, p. 37]

He notes that *"[f]or years, Trotskyist literature has denounced these
reactionary facets of the Red Army as examples of what happened to it
'under Stalinism.'"* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 37f] This claim was, amazingly
enough, also made by Trotsky himself. In 1935 he re-wrote history by
arguing that *"[i]n the fire of the cruel struggle [of the Civil War],
there could not be even a question of a privileged position for
officers: the very word was scrubbed out of the vocabulary."* Only
*"after the victories had been won and the passage made to a peaceful
situation"* did *"the military apparatus"* try to *"become the most
influential and privileged part of the whole bureaucratic apparatus"*
with *"the Stalinist bureaucracy . . . gradually over the succeeding ten
to twelve years"* ensuring for them *"a superior position"* and giving
them *"ranks and decorations."* [**How Did Stalin Defeat the
Opposition?**]

In fact, *"ranks and decorations"* and *"superior"* positions were
introduced by Trotsky **before** the outbreak of the Civil War in May
1918. Having been responsible for such developments you would think he
would remember them!

On March 28th, 1918, Trotsky gave a report to the Moscow City Conference
of the Communist Party. In this report he stated that *"the principle of
election is politically purposeless and technically inexpedient, and it
has been, in practice, abolished by decree"* and that the Bolsheviks
*"fac[ed] the task of creating a regular Army."* Why the change? Simply
because the Bolshevik Party held power (*"political power is in the
hands of the same working class from whose ranks the Army is
recruited"*). Of course, power was actually held by the Bolshevik party,
not the working class, but never fear:

> *"Once we have established the Soviet regime, that is a system under
> which the government is headed by persons who have been directly
> elected by the Soviets of Workers', Peasants' and Soldiers' Deputies,
> there can be no antagonism between the government and the mass of the
> workers, just as there is no antagonism between the administration of
> the union and the general assembly of its members, and, therefore,
> there cannot be any grounds for fearing the **appointment** of members
> of the commanding staff by the organs of the Soviet Power."* [**Work,
> Discipline, Order**]

Of course, most workers' are well aware that the administration of a
trade union usually works against them during periods of struggle.
Indeed, so are most Trotskyists as they often denounce the betrayals by
that administration. Thus Trotsky's own analogy indicates the fallacy of
his argument. Elected officials do not necessary reflect the interests
of those who elected them. That is why anarchists have always supported
**delegation** rather than representation combined with
decentralisation, strict accountability and the power of instant recall.
In a highly centralised system (as created by the Bolsheviks and as
exists in most social democratic trade unions) the ability to recall an
administration is difficult as it requires the agreement of **all** the
people. Thus there are quite a few grounds for fearing the appointment
of commanders by the government -- no matter which party makes it up.

If, as Morrow argues, the *"simple, concrete slogan of elected soldier's
committees was the only road for securing proletariat control of the
army"* then Trotsky's regime in the Red Army ensured the defeat of
proletarian control of that organisation. The question Morrow raises of
who would control the army, the working class or the bourgeois failed to
realise the real question -- who was to control the army, the working
class, the bourgeois or the state bureaucracy. Trotsky ensured that it
would be the latter.

Hence Morrow's own arguments indicate the anti-revolutionary nature of
Trotskyism -- unless, of course, we decide to look only at what people
say and not what they do.

Of course some Trotskyists know what Trotsky actually did when he held
power and try and present apologetics for his obvious destruction of
soldiers' democracy. One argues that the *"Red Army, more than any other
institution of the civil war years, embodied the contradiction between
the political consciousness and circumstantial coercion. On the one hand
the creation of a Red Army was a retreat: it was a conscripted not a
voluntary army; officers were appointed not elected . . . But the Red
Army was also filled with a magnificent socialist consciousness."* [John
Rees, *"In Defence of October"*, **International Socialism**, no. 52,
pp. 3-82, p. 46]

This argument is somewhat weak for two reasons.

Firstly, the regressive features of the Red Army appeared **before** the
start of the Civil War. It was a political decision to organise in this
way, a decision **not justified at the time in terms of circumstantial
necessity**. Indeed, far from it (like most of the other Bolshevik
policies of the period). Rather it was justified under the rather
dubious rationale that workers did not need to fear the actions of a
workers' state. Circumstances were not mentioned at all nor was the move
considered as a retreat or as a defeat. It was not even considered as a
matter of principle.

This perspective was reiterated by Trotsky after the end of the Civil
War. Writing in 1922, he argued that:

> *"There was and could be no question of controlling troops by means of
> elected committees and commanders who were subordinate to these
> committees and might be replaced at any moment . . . [The old army]
> had carried out a social revolution within itself, casting aside the
> commanders from the landlord and bourgeois classes and establishing
> organs of revolutionary self-government, in the shape of the Soviets
> of Soldiers' Deputies. These organisational and political measures
> were correct and necessary from the standpoint of breaking up the old
> army. But a new army capable of fighting could certainly not grow
> directly out of them . . . The attempt made to apply our old
> organisational methods to the building of a Red Army threatened to
> undermine it from the very outset . . . the system of election could
> in no way secure competent, suitable and authoritative commanders for
> the revolutionary army. The Red Army was built from above, in
> accordance with the principles of the dictatorship of the working
> class. Commanders were selected and tested by the organs of the Soviet
> power and the Communist Party. Election of commanders by the units
> themselves -- which were politically ill-educated, being composed of
> recently mobilised young peasants -- would inevitably have been
> transformed into a game of chance, and would often, in fact, have
> created favourable circumstances for the machinations of various
> intriguers and adventurers. Similarly, the revolutionary army, as an
> army for action and not as an arena of propaganda, was incompatible
> with a regime of elected committees, which in fact could not but
> destroy all centralised control."* [**The Path of the Red Army**]

If a *"circumstantial"* factor exists in this rationale, it is the claim
that the soldiers were *"politically ill-educated."* However, **every**
mass movement or revolution **starts** with those involved being
*"politically ill-educated."* The very process of struggle educates them
politically. A key part of this radicalisation is practising
self-management and self-organisation -- in other words, in
participating in the decision making process of the struggle, by
discussing ideas and actions, by hearing other viewpoints, electing and
mandating delegates. To remove this ensures that those involved
**remain** *"politically ill-educated"* and, ultimately, incapable of
self-government. It also contains the rationale for continuing party
dictatorship:

> *"If some people . . . have assumed the right to violate everybody's
> freedom on the pretext of preparing the triumph of freedom, they will
> always find that the people are not yet sufficiently mature, that the
> dangers of reaction are ever-present, that the education of the people
> has not yet been completed. And with these excuses they will seek to
> perpetuate their own power."* [Errico Malatesta, **Life and Ideas**,
> p. 52]

In addition, Trotsky's rationale refutes any claim that Bolshevism is
somehow "fundamentally" democratic. The ramifications of it were felt
everywhere in the soviet system as the Bolsheviks ignored the "wrong"
democratic decisions made by the working masses and replaced their
democratic organisations with appointees from above. Indeed, Trotsky
admits that the *"Red Army was built from above, in accordance with the
principles of the dictatorship of the working class."* Which means, to
state the obvious, appointment from above, the dismantling of
self-government, and so on are *"in accordance with the principles"* of
Trotskyism. These comments were not made in the heat of the civil war,
but afterward during peacetime. Notice Trotsky admits that a *"social
revolution"* had swept through the Tsarist army. His actions, he also
admits, reversed that revolution and replaced its organs of
*"self-government"* with ones identical to the old regime. When that
happens it is usually called by its true name, namely
**counter**-revolution.

For a Trotskyist, therefore, to present themselves as a supporter of
self-managed militias is the height of hypocrisy. The Stalinists
repeated the same arguments used by Trotsky and acted in exactly the
same way in their campaign against the CNT and POUM militias. Certain
acts have certain ramifications, no matter who does them or under what
government. In other words, abolishing democracy in the army will
generate autocratic tendencies which will undermine socialistic ones
**no matter who does it.** The same means cannot be used to serve
different ends as there is an intrinsic relationship between the
instruments used and the results obtained -- that is why the bourgeoisie
do not encourage democracy in the army or the workplace! Just as the
capitalist workplace is organised to produce proletarians and capital
along with cloth and steel, the capitalist army is organised to protect
and reinforce minority power. The army and the capitalist workplace are
not simply means or neutral instruments. Rather they are social
structures which generate, reinforce and **protect** specific social
relations. This is what the Russian masses instinctively realised and
conducted a social-revolution in both the army and workplace to
**transform** these structures into ones which would enhance rather than
crush freedom and working class autonomy. The Bolsheviks reversed these
movements in favour of structures which reproduced capitalist social
relationships **and justified it in terms of "socialism."**
Unfortunately, capitalist means and organisations would only generate
capitalist ends.

It was for these reasons that the CNT and its militias were organised
from the bottom up in a self-managed way. It was the only way
**socialists** and a socialist society could be created -- that is why
anarchists are anarchists, we recognise that a socialist (i.e.
libertarian) society cannot be created by authoritarian organisations.
As the justly famous Sonvillier Circular argued *"[h]ow could one expect
an egalitarian society to emerge out of an authoritarian organisation?
It is impossible."* [quoted by Brian Morris, **Bakunin: The Philosophy
of Freedom**, p. 61] Just as the capitalist state cannot be utilised by
the working class for its own ends, capitalist/statist organisational
principles such as appointment, autocratic management, centralisation
and delegation of power and so on cannot be utilised for social
liberation. They are not designed to be used for that purpose (and,
indeed, they were developed in the first place to stop it and enforce
minority rule!).

In addition, to abolish democracy on the pretext that people are not
ready for it ensures that it will never exist. Anarchists, in contrast,
argue that *"[o]nly freedom or the struggle for freedom can be the
school for freedom."* [Malatesta, **Op. Cit.**, p. 59]

Secondly, how can a *"socialist consciousness"* be encouraged, or
continue to exist, without socialist institutions to express it? Such a
position is idealistic nonsense, expressing the wishful notion that the
social relationships people experiences does not impact on those
involved. In effect, Rees is arguing that as long as the leaders have
the "right ideas" it does not matter how an organisation is structured.
However, how people develop, the ideas they have in their heads, are
influenced by the relations they create with each other -- autocratic
organisations do not encourage self-management or socialism, they
produce bureaucrats and subjects.

An autocratic organisation **cannot** encourage a socialist
consciousness by its institutional life, only in spite of it. For
example, the capitalist workplace encourages a spirit of revolt and
solidarity in those subject to its hierarchical management and this is
expressed in direct action -- by **resisting** the authority of the
boss. It only generates a socialist perspective via resistance to it.
Similarly with the Red Army. Education programs to encourage reading and
writing does not generate socialists, it generates soldiers who are
literate. If these soldiers do not have the institutional means to
manage their own affairs, a forum to discuss political and social
issues, then they remain order takers and any socialist conscious will
wither and die.

The Red Army was based on the fallacy that the structure of an
organisation is unimportant and it is the politics of those in charge
that matter (Marxists make a similar claim for the state, so we should
not be too surprised). However, it is no co-incidence that bourgeois
structures are always hierarchical -- self-management is a politically
educational experience which erodes the power of those in charge and
transforms those who do it. It is to stop this development, to protect
the power of the ruling few, that the bourgeois always turn to
centralised, hierarchical structures -- they reinforce elite rule. You
cannot use the same form of organisation and expect different results --
they are designed that way for a reason! To twitter on about the Red
Army being *"filled with a magnificent socialist consciousness"* while
justifying the elimination of the only means by which that consciousness
could survive, prosper and grow indicates a complete lack of socialist
politics and any understanding of materialist philosophy.

Moreover, one of the basic principles of the anarchist militia was
equality between all members. Delegates received the same pay, ate the
same food, wore the same clothes as the rest of the unit. Not so in the
Red Army. Trotsky thought, when he was in charge of it, that inequality
was *"in some cases . . . quite explicable and unavoidable"* and that
*"[e]very Red Army warrior fully accepts that the commander of his unit
should enjoy certain privileges as regards lodging, means of transport
and even uniform."* [**More Equality!**]

Of course, Trotsky would think that, being the head commander of the
Army. Unfortunately, because soldier democracy had been abolished by
decree, we have no idea whether the rank and file of the Red Army agreed
with him. For Trotsky, privilege *"is, in itself, in certain cases,
inevitable"* but *"**[o]stentatious indulgence** in privilege is not
just evil, it is a crime."* Hence his desire for *"more"* equality
rather than equality -- to aim for *"eliminating the most abnormal [!]
phenomena, softening [!] the inequality that exists"* rather than
abolish it as they did in the CNT militias. [**Op. Cit.**]

But, of course, such inequalities that existed in the Red Army are to be
expected in an autocratically run organisation. The inequality inherent
in hierarchy, the inequality in power between the order giver and order
taker, will, sooner or later, be reflected in material inequality. As
happened in the Red Army (and all across the "workers' state"). All
Trotsky wanted was for those in power to be respectable in their
privilege rather than showing it off. The anarchist militias did not
have this problem because being libertarian, delegates were subject to
recall and power rested with the rank and file, **not** an elected
government.

As another irony of history, Morrow quotes a Bolshevik-Leninist leaflet
(which *"points the road"*) as demanding *"[e]qual pay for officers and
soldiers."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 191] Obviously these good Trotskyists had
no idea what their hero actually wrote on this subject or did when in
power. We have to wonder how long their egalitarian demands would have
survived once they had acquired power -- if the experience of Trotsky in
power is anything to go by, not very long.

Trotsky did not consider how the abolition of democracy and its
replacement with an autocratic system would effect the morale or
consciousness of the soldiers subject to it. He argued that in the Red
Army *"the **best** soldier does not mean at all the **most submissive
and uncomplaining.**"* Rather, *"the best soldier will nearly always be
sharper, more observant and critical than the others. . . by his
critical comments, based on facts accessible to all, he will pretty
often undermine the prestige of the commanders and commissars in the
eyes of the mass of the soldiers."* However, not having a democratic
army the soldiers could hardly express their opinion other than
rebellion or by indiscipline. Trotsky, however, adds a comment that
makes his praise of critical soldiers seem less than sincere. He states
that *"counter-revolutionary elements, agents of the enemy, make
conscious and skilful use of the circumstances I have mentioned
[presumably excessive privilege rather than critical soldiers, but who
can tell] in order to stir up discontent and intensify antagonism
between rank and file and the commanding personnel."* [**Op. Cit.**] The
question, of course, arises of who can tell the difference between a
critical soldier and a *"counter-revolutionary element"*? Without a
democratic organisation, soldier are dependent (as in any other
hierarchy) on the power of the commanders, commissars and, in the Red
Army, the Bolshevik Secret Police (the Cheka). In other words, members
of the very class of autocrats their comments are directed against.

Without democratic organisation, the Red Army could never be a means for
creating a socialist society, only a means of reproducing autocratic
organisation. The influence of the autocratic organisation created by
Trotsky had a massive impact on the development of the Soviet State.
According to Trotsky himself:

> *"The demobilisation of the Red Army of five million played no small
> role in the formation of the bureaucracy. The victorious commanders
> assumed leading posts in the local Soviets, in economy, in education,
> and they persistently introduced everywhere that regime which had
> ensured success in the civil war. Thus on all sides the masses were
> pushed away gradually from actual participation in the leadership of
> the country."* [**The Revolution Betrayed**]

Obviously Trotsky had forgotten who created the regime in the Red Army
in the first place! He also seems to have forgotten that after
militarising the Red Army, he turned his power to militarising workers
(starting with the railway workers). He also forgets that Lenin had been
arguing that workers' must *"**unquestioningly obey the single will** of
the leaders of labour"* from April 1918 along with granting *"individual
executives dictatorial power (or 'unlimited' powers)"* and that *"the
appointment of individuals, dictators with unlimited powers"* was, in
fact, *"in general compatible with the fundamental principles of Soviet
government"* simply because *"the history of revolutionary movements"*
had *"shown"* that *"the dictatorship of individuals was very often the
expression, the vehicle, the channel of the dictatorship of
revolutionary classes."* He notes that *"[u]ndoubtably, the dictatorship
of individuals was compatible with bourgeois democracy."* [**The
Immediate Tasks of the Soviet Government**, p. 34 and p. 32]

In other words, Lenin urged the creation of, and implemented,
**bourgeois** forms of workplace management based on the appointment of
managers from above. To indicate that this was not in contradiction with
Soviet principles, he points to the example of **bourgeois**
revolutions! As if bourgeois methods do not reflect bourgeois interests
and goals. In addition, these "dictators" were given the same autocratic
powers Trotsky claimed the demobilisation of the Red Army four years
later had *"persistently introduced everywhere."* Yes, *"on all sides
the masses were pushed away gradually from actual participation in the
leadership of the country"* but the process had started immediately
after the October Revolution and was urged and organised by Lenin and
Trotsky before the Civil War had started.

Lenin's support for appointment of (*"dictatorial"*) managers from above
makes Trotsky's 1922 comment that the *"Red Army was built from above,
in accordance with the principles of the dictatorship of the working
class"* take on a new light. [**The Path of the Red Army**] After all,
Lenin argued for an economy system built from above via the appointment
of managers before the start of the Civil War. The Red Army was created
from above via the appointment of officers before the start of the Civil
War. Things had certainly changed since Lenin had argued in **The State
and Revolution** that *"[a]ll officials, without exception, [would be]
elected and subject to recall **at any time.**"* This would *"serve as
the bridge between capitalism and socialism."* [**The Essential Lenin**,
p. 302] One major difference, given Trotsky's rationales, seems to be
that the Bolsheviks were now in power and so election and recall without
exception could be forgotten and replaced by appointment.

In summary, Trotsky's argument against functional democracy in the Red
Army could, and was, used to justify the suppression of any democratic
decision or organisation of the working class the Bolshevik government
disapproved of. He used the same argument, for example, to justify the
undermining of the Factory Committee movement and the struggle for
workers' control in favour of one-man management -- the form of
management in the workplace was irrelevant as the workers' were now
citizens of a workers' state and under a workers' government (see
[section 17](append32.html#app17)). Needless to say, a state which
eliminates functional democracy in the grassroots will not stay
democratic for long (and to remain the sovereign power in society, any
state will have to eliminate it or, at the very least, bring it under
central control -- as institutionalised in the USSR constitution of
1918).

Instead of seeing socialism as a product of free association, of working
class self-organisation from the bottom up by self-managed
organisations, Trotsky saw it as a centralised, top-down system. Of
course, being a democrat of sorts he saw the Bolshevik Government as
being elected by the mass of the population (or, more correctly, he saw
it being elected by the national congress of soviets). However, his
vision of centralisation of power provided the rationale for destroying
functional democracy in the grass-roots -- and without healthy roots,
any plant will wither and die. Little wonder, then, that the Bolshevik
experiment proved such a disaster -- yes, the civil war did not help but
the logic of Bolshevism has started to undermine working class
self-management **before** is started.

Thus Trotsky's argument that the democratic nature of a workers' army or
militia is irrelevant because a "workers' state" exists is flawed on
many different levels. And the experience of Trotsky in power indicates
well the poverty of Trotskyism and Morrow's criticism of the CNT -- his
suggestion for a self-managed militia is pure anarchism with nothing to
do with Leninism and the experience of Bolshevism in power.

12. What is ironic about Morrow's vision of revolution?
-------------------------------------------------------

Equally ironic as Morrow's comments concerning democratic militias (see
[last section](append32.html#app11)) is his argument that the revolution
needed to *"give the factory committees, militia committees, peasant
committees, a democratic character, by having them elected by all
workers in each unit; to bring together these elected delegates in
village, city, regional councils . . . [and] a national congress."*
[**Op. Cit.**, p. 100]

Such a position is correct, such developments were required to ensure
the success of the revolution. However, it is somewhat ironic that a
Trotskyist would present them as somehow being opposed to anarchism
when, in fact, they are pure anarchism. Indeed, anarchists were arguing
in favour of workers' councils more than five decades before Lenin
discovered the importance of the Russian Soviets in 1917. Moreover, as
we will indicate, what is even more ironic is the fact that Trotskyism
does not actually see these organs as an expression of working class
self-management and power but rather as a means of the party to take
power. In addition, we must also note that it was Lenin and Trotsky who
helped undermine the Russian workers' factory committees, militia
committees and so on in favour of party rule. We will discuss each of
these ironies in turn.

Firstly, as noted, such Morrow's stated position is exactly what Bakunin
and the anarchist movement had been arguing since the 1860s. To quote
Bakunin:

> *"the federative alliance of all working men's associations . . .
> constitute the Commune . . . all provinces, communes and associations
> . . . by first **reorganising** on revolutionary lines . . . [will]
> constitute the federation of insurgent associations, communes and
> provinces . . . [and] organise a revolutionary force capable defeating
> reaction . . . [and for] self-defence . . . [The] revolution
> everywhere must be created by the people, and supreme control must
> always belong to the people organised into a free federation of
> agricultural and industrial associations . . . organised from the
> bottom upwards by means of revolutionary delegation. . . "* [**Michael
> Bakunin: Selected Writings**, p. 170-2]
>
> *"The future social organisation must be made solely from the bottom
> up, by the free association or federation of workers, firstly in their
> unions, then in the communes, regions, nations and finally in a great
> federation, international and universal."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 206]

Here is Kropotkin presenting the same vision:

> *"independent Communes for the territorial organisation, and of
> federations of Trade Unions [i.e. workplace associations] for the
> organisation of men [and women] in accordance with their different
> functions. . . [and] free combines and societies . . . for the
> satisfaction of all possible and imaginable needs, economic, sanitary,
> and educational; for mutual protection, for the propaganda of ideas,
> for arts, for amusement, and so on."* [Peter Kropotkin, **Evolution
> and Environment**, p. 79]
>
> *"the complete independence of the Communes, the Federation of free
> communes and the social revolution in the communes, that is to say the
> formation of associated productive groups in place of the state
> organisation."* [quoted by Camillo Berneri, **Peter Kropotkin: His
> Federalist Ideas**]

Bakunin also mentions that those defending the revolution would have a
say in the revolutionary structure -- the *"Commune will be organised by
the standing federation of the Barricades and by the creation of a
Revolutionary Council composed of . . . delegates from each barricade .
. . vested with plenary but accountable and removable mandates."* [**Op.
Cit.**, p. 171] This obviously parallels the democratic nature of the
CNT militias.

Interestingly enough, Marx commented that *"odd barricades, these
barricades of the Alliance [Bakunin's anarchist organisation], where
instead of fighting they spend their time writing mandates."* [Marx,
Engels and Lenin, **Anarchism and Anarcho-Syndicalism**, p. 111]
Obviously the importance of militia self-management was as lost on him
as it was on Lenin and Trotsky -- under Marx's state would its defenders
just be cannon-fodder, obeying their government and officers without the
ability to help determine the revolution they were fighting for?
Apparently so. Moreover, Marx quotes Bakunin's support for *"responsible
and recallable delegates, vested with their imperative mandates"*
without commenting on the fact Bakunin **predicts** those features of
the Paris Commune Marx praised in his **Civil War in France** by a
number of years. Looks like Morrow is not the first Marxist to
appropriate anarchist ideas without crediting their source.

As can be seen, Morrow's suggestion on how to push the Spanish
Revolution forward just repeats the ideas of anarchism. Any one familiar
with anarchist theory would not be surprised by this as they would know
that we have seen a free federation of workplace and communal
associations as the basis of a revolution and, therefore, a free society
since the time of Proudhon. Thus Morrow's "Trotskyist" vision of a
federation of workers' council actually reproduces basic anarchist
ideas, ideas which pre-date Lenin's support for soviets as the basis of
his "workers' state" by over half a century (we will indicate the
fundamental difference between the anarchist vision and the Trotskyist
in due course).

As an aside, these quotes by Bakunin and Kropotkin make a mockery of
Lenin's assertion that anarchists do not analysis *"**what** to put in
the place of what has been destroyed [i.e. the old state machine] and
**how**"* [**Essential Works of Lenin**, p. 362] Anarchists have always
suggested a clear answer to what we should *"replace"* the state with --
namely free federations of working class organisations created in the
struggle against capital and state. To state otherwise is to either be
ignorant of anarchist theory or seek to deceive.

Some anarchists like Bakunin and the anarcho-syndicalists and
collectivists saw these organisations being based primarily on
libertarian labour unions complemented by whatever organisations were
created in the process of revolution (*"The future society must be
nothing else than the universalisation of the organisation that the
International has formed for itself"* -- *"The Sonvillier Circular"*
echoing Bakunin, quoted by Brian Morris, **Bakunin: The Philosophy of
Freedom**, p. 61] Others like Kropotkin and anarcho-communists saw it as
a free federation of organisations created by the process of revolution
itself. While anarchists did not present a blueprint of what would occur
after the revolution (and rightly so) they did provide a general outline
in terms of a decentralised, free federation of self-managed workers'
associations as well as linking these future forms of working class
self-government with the forms generated in the current class struggle
in the here and now.

Similarly, Lenin's other assertion that anarchists do not study *"the
**concrete** lessons of previous proletarian revolutions"* [**Ibid.**]
is equally baseless, as any one reading, say, Kropotkin's work would
soon realise (for example, **The Great French Revolution**, **Modern
Science and Anarchism** or his pamphlet *"Revolutionary Government"*).
Starting with Bakunin, anarchists analysed the experiences of the Paris
Commune and the class struggle itself to generalise political
conclusions from them (for example, the vision of a free society as a
federation of workers' associations is clearly a product of analysing
the class struggle and looking at the failures of the Commune). Given
that Lenin states in the same work that *"anarchists had tried to claim
the Paris Commune as their 'own'"* [p. 350] suggests that anarchists
**had** studied the Paris Commune and he was aware of that fact. Of
course, Lenin states that we had *"failed to give . . . a true
solution"* to its lessons -- given that the solution anarchists proposed
was a federation of workers councils to smash the state and defend the
revolution his comments seem strange as this, according to **The State
and Revolution**, is the "Marxist" solution as well (in fact, as we will
soon see, Lenin played lip service to this and instead saw the solution
as government by his party rather than the masses as a whole).

Thus, Morrow's vision of what was required for a successful revolution
parallels that of anarchism. We shall now discuss where and how they
differ.

The essential difference between the anarchist and Trotskyist vision of
workers' councils as the basis of a revolution is what role these
councils should play. For anarchists, these federations of self-managed
assemblies is the actual framework of the revolution (and the free
society it is trying to create). As Murray Bookchin puts it:

> *"There can be no separation of the revolutionary process from the
> revolutionary goal. **A society based on self-administration must be
> achieved by means of self-administration** . . . Assembly and
> community must arise from within the revolutionary process itself;
> indeed, the revolutionary process must **be** the formation of
> assembly and community, and with it, the destruction of power.
> Assembly and community must become 'fighting words,' not distinct
> panaceas. They must be created as **modes of struggle** against the
> existing society, not as theoretical or programmatic abstractions. . .
> The factory committees . . . must be managed directly by workers'
> assemblies in the factories. . . neighbourhood committees, councils
> and boards must be rooted completely in the neighbourhood assemble.
> They must be answerable at every point to the assembly, they and their
> work must be under continual review by the assembly; and finally,
> their members must be subject to immediate recall by the assembly. The
> specific gravity of society, in short, must be shifted to its base --
> the armed people in permanent assembly."* [**Post-Scarcity
> Anarchism**, pp. 167-9]

Thus the anarchist social revolution sees workers' councils as organs of
working class self-management, the means by which they control their own
lives and create a new society based on their needs, visions, dreams and
hopes. They are not seen as means by which others, the revolutionary
party, seized power **on behalf** of the people as Trotskyists do.

Harsh words? No, as can be seen from Morrow who is quite clear on the
role of working class organisation -- it is seen purely as the means by
which the party can take power. As he argues, there is *"no magic in the
soviet form: it is merely the most accurate, most quickly reflecting and
responsively changing form of political representation of the masses. .
. It would provide the arena in which the revolutionary party can win
the support of the working class."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 136]

He states that initially the *"reformist majority in the executive
committee would decline the assumption of state power. But the workers
could still find in the soviets their natural organs of struggle until
the genuinely revolutionary elements in the various parties banded
together to win a revolutionary majority in the congress and establish a
workers' state."* In other words, the *"workers' state, the dictatorship
of the proletariat . . . can only be brought into existence by the
direct, **political** intervention of the masses, through the factory
and village councils (soviets) at that point where a majority in the
soviets is wielded by the workers' party or parties which are determined
to overthrow the bourgeois state. Such was the basic theoretical
contribution of Lenin."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 100 and p. 113]

From an anarchist perspective, this indicates well the fundamental
difference between anarchism and Trotskyism. For anarchists, the
existence of an *"executive committee"* indicates that the workers'
council do not, in fact, have power in society -- rather it is the
minority in the executive committee who have been delegated power.
Rather than govern themselves and society directly, workers are turned
into voters implementing the decisions their leaders have made on their
behalf. If revolutionary bodies like workers' councils **did** create a
"workers' state" (as Morrow recommends) then their power would be
transferred and centralised into the hands of a so-called
"revolutionary" government. In this, Morrow follows his guru Trotsky:

> *"the proletariat can take power only through its vanguard. In itself
> the necessity for state power arises from an insufficient cultural
> level of the masses and their heterogeneity. In the revolutionary
> vanguard, organised in a party, is crystallised the aspirations of the
> masses to obtain their freedom. Without the confidence of the class in
> the vanguard, without support of the vanguard by the class, there can
> be no talk of the conquest of power.*
>
> "In this sense the proletarian revolution and dictatorship are the
> work of the whole class, but only under the leadership of the
> vanguard." [Trotsky, **Stalinism and Bolshevism**]

Thus, rather than the working class as a whole "seizing power", it is
the *"vanguard"* which takes power -- *"a revolutionary party, even
after seizing power . . . is still by no means the sovereign ruler of
society."* [**Ibid.**] He mocks the anarchist idea that a socialist
revolution should be based on the self-management of workers within
their own autonomous class organisations:

> *"Those who propose the abstraction of Soviets to the party
> dictatorship should understand that only thanks to the party
> dictatorship were the Soviets able to lift themselves out of the mud
> of reformism and attain the state form of the proletariat."* [Trotsky,
> **Op. Cit.**, p. 18]

In this he followed comments made when he was in power. In 1920 he
argued that *"[w]e have more than once been accused of having
substituted for the dictatorships of the Soviets the dictatorship of the
party. Yet it can be said with complete justice that the dictatorship of
the Soviets became possible only be means of the dictatorship of the
party. It is thanks to the . . . party . . . [that] the Soviets . . .
[became] transformed from shapeless parliaments of labour into the
apparatus of the supremacy of labour. In this 'substitution' of the
power of the party for the power of the working class these is nothing
accidental, and in reality there is no substitution at all. The
Communists express the fundamental interests of the working class."*
[**Terrorism and Communism**, p. 109] Any claims that Trotsky's
infamously authoritarian (indeed dictatorial) politics were a temporary
aberration caused by the necessities of the Russian Civil War are
refuted by these quotes -- 17 years later he was still arguing the same
point.

He had the same vision of party dictatorship being the basis of a
revolution in 1924. Commenting on the Bolshevik Party conference of
April 1917, he states that *"whole of . . . Conference was devoted to
the following fundamental question: Are we heading toward the conquest
of power in the name of the socialist revolution or are we helping
(anybody and everybody) to complete the democratic revolution? . . .
Lenin's position was this: . . . the capture of the soviet majority; the
overthrow of the Provisional Government; the seizure of power through
the soviets."* Note, **through** the soviets not **by** the soviets thus
indicating the fact the Party would hold the real power, not the soviets
of workers' delegates. Moreover, he states that *"to prepare the
insurrection and to carry it out under cover of preparing for the Second
Soviet Congress and under the slogan of defending it, was of inestimable
advantage to us."* He continued by noting that it was *"one thing to
prepare an armed insurrection under the naked slogan of the seizure of
power by the party, and quite another thing to prepare and then carry
out an insurrection under the slogan of defending the rights of the
Congress of Soviets."* The Soviet Congress just provided *"the legal
cover"* for the Bolshevik plans rather than a desire to see the Soviets
actually start managing society. [**The Lessons of October**]

We are not denying that Trotskyists do aim to gain a majority within
working class conferences. That is clear. Anarchists also seek to gain
the support of the mass of the population. It is what they do next that
counts. Trotskyists seek to create a government above these
organisations and dominate the executive committees that requires. Thus
power in society shifts to the top, to the leaders of the centralised
party in charge of the centralised state. The workers' become mere
electors rather than actual controllers of the revolution. Anarchists,
in contrast, seek to dissolve power back into the hands of society and
empower the individual by giving them a direct say in the revolution
through their workplace, community and militia assemblies and their
councils and conferences.

Trotskyists, therefore, advocate workers councils because they see them
as **the** means the vanguard party can take power. Rather than seeing
socialism or "workers' power" as a society in which everyone would
directly control their own affairs, Trotskyists see it in terms of
working class people delegating their power into the hands of a
government. Needless to say, the two things are not identical and, in
practice, the government soon turns from being the people's servant into
its master.

It is clear that Morrow always discusses workers councils in terms of
the strategy and program of the party, not the value that workers
councils have as organs of direct workers control of society. He clearly
advocates workers councils because he sees them as the best way for the
vanguard party to rally workers around its leadership and organise the
seizure of state power. At no time does he see then as means by which
working class people can govern themselves directly -- quite the
reverse.

The danger of such an approach is obvious. The government will soon
become isolated from the mass of the population and, due to the
centralised nature of the state, difficult to hold accountable.
Moreover, given the dominant role of the party in the new state and the
perspective that it is the workers' vanguard, it becomes increasingly
likely that it will place its power before that of those it claims to
represent.

Certainly Trotsky's role in the Russian revolution tells us that the
power of the party was more important to him than democratic control by
workers through mass bodies. When the workers and sailors of the
Kronstadt navy base rebelled in 1921, in solidarity with striking
workers in Petrograd, they were demanding freedom of the press for
socialist and anarchist groups and new elections to the soviets. But the
reaction of the Bolshevik leadership was to crush the Kronstadt dissent
in blood. Trotsky's attitude towards workers democracy was clearly
expressed at the time:

> *"They [the dissent Bolsheviks of the Workers' Opposition] have placed
> the workers' right to elect representatives above the Party. As if the
> Party were not entitled to assert its dictatorship even if that
> dictatorship temporarily clashed with the passing moods of the
> worker's democracy!"*

He spoke of the *"revolutionary historic birthright of the Party"* and
that it *"is obliged to maintain its dictatorship . . . regardless of
temporary vacillations even in the working class . . . The dictatorship
does not base itself at every given moment on the formal principle of a
workers' democracy."* [quoted by M. Brinton, **Op. Cit.**, p. 78]

This perspective naturally follows from Trotsky's vanguardist politics.
For Leninists, the party is the bearer of *"socialist consciousness"*
and, according to Lenin in **What is to be Done?**, workers, by their
own efforts, can only achieve a *"trade union"* consciousness and,
indeed, *"there can be no talk of an independent ideology being
developed by the masses of workers in the process of their struggle"*
and so *"**the only choice is**: either bourgeois or socialist
ideology"* (the later being developed not by workers but by the
*"bourgeois intelligentsia"*). [**Essential Works of Lenin**, p. 82 and
p. 74] To weaken or question the party means to weaken or question the
socialist nature of the revolution and so weaken the *"dictatorship of
the proletariat."* Thus we have the paradoxical situation of the
"proletarian dictatorship" repressing workers, eliminating democracy and
maintaining itself against the *"passing moods"* of the workers (which
means rejecting what democracy is all about). Hence Lenin's comment at a
conference of the Cheka (his political police) in 1920:

> *"Without revolutionary coercion directed against the avowed enemies
> of the workers and peasants, it is impossible to break down the
> resistance of these exploiters. On the other hand, revolutionary
> coercion is bound to be employed towards the wavering and unstable
> elements among the masses themselves."* [**Collected Works**, vol. 24,
> p. 170]

Significantly, of the 17 000 camp detainees on whom statistical
information was available on 1 November 1920, peasants and workers
constituted the largest groups, at 39% and 34% respectively. Similarly,
of the 40 913 prisoners held in December 1921 (of whom 44% had been
committed by the Cheka) nearly 84% were illiterate or minimally
educated, clearly, therefore, either peasants of workers. [George
Leggett, **The Cheka: Lenin's Political Police**, p. 178] Needless to
say, Lenin failed to mention this aspect of his system in **The State
and Revolution** (a failure shared by Morrow and later Trotskyists).

It is hard to combine these facts and Lenin's and Trotsky's comments
with the claim that the "workers' state" is an instrument of class rule
-- after all, Lenin is acknowledging that coercion will be exercised
against members of the working class as well. The question of course
arises -- who decides what a *"wavering"* or *"unstable"* element is?
Given their comments on the role of the party and the need for the party
to assume power, it will mean in practice whoever rejects the
government's decisions (for example, strikers, local soviets who reject
central decrees and instructions, workers who vote for anarchists or
parties other than the Bolshevik party in elections to soviets, unions
and so on, socialists and anarchists, etc.). Given a hierarchical
system, Lenin's comment is simply a justification for state repression
of its enemies (including elements within or even the whole working
class).

It could be argued, however, that workers could use the soviets to
recall the government. However, this fails for two reasons (we will
ignore the question of the interests of the bureaucratic machine which
will inevitably surround a centralised body -- see [section
H.3.9](secH3.html#sech39) for further discussion).

Firstly, the Leninist state will be highly centralised, with power
flowing from the top-down. This means that in order to revoke the
government, all the soviets in all parts of the country must, at the
same time, recall their delegates and organise a national congress of
soviets (which, we stress, is not in permanent session). The local
soviets are bound to carry out the commands of the central government
(to quote the Soviet constitution of 1918 -- they are to *"carry out all
orders of the respective higher organs of the soviet power"*). Any
independence on their part would be considered *"wavering"* or an
expression of *"unstable"* natures and so subject to *"revolutionary
coercion"*. In a highly centralised system, the means of accountability
is reduced to the usual bourgeois level -- vote in the general election
every few years (which, in any case, can be annulled by the government
to ensure that the soviets do not go back into the *"mud"* via the
*"passing moods"* caused by the *"insufficient cultural level of the
masses"*). In other words, the soviet form may be the *"most accurate,
most quickly reflecting and responsively changing form of political
representation of the masses"* (to use Morrow's words) but only
**before** they become transformed into state organs.

Secondly, *"revolutionary coercion"* against *"wavering"* elements does
not happen in isolation. It will encourage critical workers to keep
quiet in case they, too, are deemed *"unstable"* and become subject to
*"revolutionary"* coercion. As a government policy it can have no other
effect than deterring democracy.

Thus Trotskyist politics provides the rationale for eliminating even the
limited role of soviets for electing representatives they hold in that
ideology.

Morrow argues that *"[o]ne must never forget . . . that soviets **do not
begin** as organs of state power"* rather they start as *"organs
defending the workers' daily interests"* and include *"powerful strike
committees."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 136] That is true, initially workers'
councils are expressions of working class power and are organs of
working class self-management and self-activity. They are subject to
direct control from below and unite from the bottom up. However, once
they are turned into *"organs of state power"* their role (to re-quote
the Soviet constitution of 1918) becomes that of *"carry[ing] out all
orders of the respective higher organs of the soviet power."* Soviet
power is replaced by party power and they become a shell of their former
selves -- essentially rubber-stamps for the decisions of the party
central committee.

Ironically, Morrow quotes the main theoretician of the Spanish Socialist
Party as stating *"the organ of the proletarian dictatorship will be the
Socialist Party"* and states that they *"were saying precisely what the
anarchist leaders had been accusing both communists and revolutionary
socialists of meaning by the proletarian dictatorship."* [**Op. Cit.**,
p. 99 and p. 100] This is hardly surprising, as this was what the likes
of Lenin and Trotsky **had** been arguing. As well as the quotes we have
provided above, we may add Trotsky's comment that the *"fundamental
instrument of proletarian revolution is the party."* [**Lessons of
October**] And the resolution of the Second World Congress of the
Communist International which stated that *"[e]very class struggle is a
political struggle. The goal of this struggle . . . is the conquest of
political power. Political power cannot be seized, organised and
operated except through a political party."* [cited by Duncan Hallas,
**The Comintern**, p. 35] In addition, we may quote Lenin's opinion
that:

> *"The very presentation of the question -- 'dictatorship of the Party
> **or** dictatorship of the class, dictatorship (Party) of the leaders
> **or** dictatorship (Party) of the masses?' -- is evidence of the most
> incredible and hopeless confusion of mind . . . [because] classes are
> usually . . . led by political parties. . . "*

And:

> *"To go so far in this matter as to draw a contrast in general between
> the dictatorship of the masses and the dictatorship of the leaders, is
> ridiculously absurd and stupid."* [**Left-wing Communism: An Infantile
> Disorder**, pp. 25-6 and p. 27]

As Lenin and Trotsky constantly argued, proletarian dictatorship was
impossible without the political party of the workers (whatever its
name). Indeed, to even discuss any difference between the dictatorship
of the class and that of the party just indicated a confused mind. Hence
Morrow's comments are incredulous, particularly as he himself stresses
that the soviet form is useful purely as a means of gaining support for
the revolutionary party which would take over the executive of the
workers' councils. He clearly is aware that the party is the
**essential** organ of proletarian rule from a Leninist perspective --
without the dictatorship of the party, Trotsky argues, the soviets fall
back into the mud. Trotsky, indeed, stressed this need for the
dictatorship of the party rather than of the proletariat in a letter
written in 1937:

> *"The revolutionary dictatorship of a proletarian party is for me not
> a thing that one can freely accept or reject: It is an objective
> necessity imposed upon us by the social realities -- the class
> struggle, the heterogeneity of the revolutionary class, the necessity
> for a selected vanguard in order to assure the victory. The
> dictatorship of a party belongs to the barbarian prehistory as does
> the state itself, but we can not jump over this chapter, which can
> open (not at one stroke) genuine human history. . . The revolutionary
> party (vanguard) which renounces its own dictatorship surrenders the
> masses to the counter-revolution . . . Abstractly speaking, it would
> be very well if the party dictatorship could be replaced by the
> 'dictatorship' of the whole toiling people without any party, but this
> presupposes such a high level of political development among the
> masses that it can never be achieved under capitalist conditions. The
> reason for the revolution comes from the circumstance that capitalism
> does not permit the material and the moral development of the
> masses."* [Trotsky, **Writings 1936-37**, pp. 513-4]

The net result of Bolshevik politics in Russia was that Lenin and
Trotsky undermined the self-management of working class bodies during
the Russian Revolution and **before** the Civil War started in May 1918.
We have already chronicled Trotsky's elimination of democracy and
equality in the Red Army (see [section 11](append32.html#app11)). A
similar fate befell the factory committees (see [section
17](append32.html#app17)) and soviet democracy (as noted above). The
logic of Bolshevism is such that at no point did Lenin describe the
suppression of soviet democracy and workers' control as a defeat
(indeed, as far as workers' control went Lenin quickly moved to a
position favouring one-man management). We discuss the Russian
Revolution in more detail in the appendix on ["What happened during the
Russian Revolution?"](append41.html) and so will not do so here.

All in all, while Morrow's rhetoric on the nature of the social
revolution may sound anarchist, there are important differences between
the two visions. While Trotskyists support workers' councils on purely
instrumentalist grounds as the best means of gaining support for their
party's assumption of governmental power, anarchists see workers'
councils as the means by which people can revolutionise society and
themselves by practising self-management in all aspects of their lives.
The difference is important and its ramifications signify why the
Russian Revolution became the "dictatorship **over** the proletariat"
Bakunin predicted. His words still ring true:

> *"[b]y popular government they [the Marxists] mean government of the
> people by a small under of representatives elected by the people. . .
> [That is,] government of the vast majority of the people by a
> privileged minority. But this minority, the Marxists say, will consist
> of workers. Yes, perhaps, of **former** workers, who, as soon as they
> become rulers or representatives of the people will cease to be
> workers and will begin to look upon the whole workers' world from the
> heights of the state. They will no longer represent the people but
> themselves and their own pretensions to govern the people."*
> [**Statism and Anarchy**, p. 178]

It was for this reason that he argued the anarchists do *"not accept,
even in the process of revolutionary transition, either constituent
assemblies, provisional governments or so-called revolutionary
dictatorships; because we are convinced that revolution is only sincere,
honest and real in the hands of the masses, and that when it is
concentrated in those of a few ruling individuals it inevitably and
immediately becomes reaction."* [**Michael Bakunin: Selected Writings**,
p. 237] The history of the Russian Revolution proved him right. Hence
anarchist support for popular assemblies and federations of workers'
councils as the framework of the social revolution rather than as a
means to elect a "revolutionary" government.

One last point. We must point out that Morrow's follows Lenin in
favouring executive committees associated with workers' councils. In
this he actually ignores Marx's (and Lenin's, in **State and
Revolution**) comments that the Paris Commune was *"to be a working, not
a parliamentary, body, executive and legislative at the same time."*
[**Selected Writings**, p. 287] The existence of executive committees
was coded into the Soviet Union's 1918 Constitution. This suggests two
things. Firstly, Leninism and Trotskyism differ on fundamental points
with Marx and so the claim that Leninism equals Marxism is difficult to
support (the existence of libertarian Marxists like Anton Pannekoek and
other council communists also disprove such claims). Secondly, it
indicates that Lenin's claims in **State and Revolution** were ignored
once the Bolsheviks took power so indicating that use of that work to
prove the democratic nature of Bolshevism is flawed.

Moreover, Marx's support of the fusion of executive and legislative
powers is not as revolutionary as some imagine. For anarchists, as
Bookchin argues, *"[i]n point of fact, the consolidation of 'executive
and legislative' functions in a single body was regressive. It simply
identified the process of policy-making, a function that rightly should
belong to the people in assembly, with the technical execution of these
policies, a function that should be left to strictly administrative
bodies subject to rotation, recall, limitations of tenure . . .
Accordingly, the melding of policy formation with administration placed
the institutional emphasis of classical [Marxist] socialism on
centralised bodies, indeed, by an ironical twist of historical events,
bestowing the privilege of formulating policy on the 'higher bodies' of
socialist hierarchies and their execution precisely on the more popular
'revolutionary committees' below."* [**Toward an Ecological Society**,
pp. 215-6]

13. Why do anarchists reject the Marxist "workers' state"?
----------------------------------------------------------

Morrow asserts two *"fundamental"* tenets of *"anarchism"* in his book
[**Op. Cit.**, pp. 101-2]. Unfortunately for him, his claims are
somewhat at odds with reality. Anarchism, as we will prove in [section
14](append32.html#app14), does not hold one of the positions Morrow
states it does. The first *"tenet"* of anarchism he fails to discuss at
all and so the reader cannot understand **why** anarchists think as they
do. We discuss this *"tenet"* here.

The first tenet is that anarchism *"has consistently refused to
recognise the distinction between a bourgeois and a workers' state. Even
in the days of Lenin and Trotsky, anarchism denounced the Soviet Union
as an exploiters' regime."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 101] It is due to this, he
argues, the CNT co-operated with the bourgeois state:

> *"The false anarchist teachings on the nature of the state . . .
> should logically have led them [the CNT] to refuse governmental
> participation in any event . . . the anarchists were in the
> intolerable position of objecting to the necessary administrative
> co-ordination and centralisation of the work they had already begun.
> Their anti-statism 'as such' had to be thrown off. What **did**
> remain, to wreck disaster in the end, was their failure to recognise
> the distinction between a workers' and a bourgeois state."* [**Op.
> Cit.**, p. 101]

Needless to say, Morrow does not bother to explain **why** anarchists
consider the bourgeois and workers' state to be similar. If he did then
perhaps his readers would agree with the anarchists on this matter.
However, before discussing that we have to address a misrepresentation
of Morrow's. Rather than the expression of anarchist politics, the
actions of the CNT were in direct opposition to them. As we showed in
the [section 12](append32.html#app12), anarchists see a social
revolution in terms of creating federations of workers associations
(i.e. workers' councils). It was this vision that had created the
structure of the CNT (as Bakunin had argued, *"the organisation of the
trade sections and their representation in the Chambers of Labour . . .
bear in themselves the living seeds of the new society which is to
replace the old one. They are creating not only the ideas, but also the
facts of the future itself"* [**Bakunin on Anarchism**, p. 255]).

Thus, the social revolution would see the workers' organisation (be they
labour unions or spontaneously created organs) *"tak[ing] the revolution
into its own hands . . . an earnest international organisation of
workers' associations . . . [would] replac[e] this departing political
world of States and bourgeoisie."* [**The Basic Bakunin**, p. 110] This
is **precisely** what the CNT did not do -- rather it decided against
following anarchist theory and instead decided to co-operate with other
parties and unions in the *"Central Committee of Anti-Fascist Militias"*
(at least temporarily until the CNT stronghold in Saragossa was
liberated by CNT militias). In effect, it created a UGT-like "Alliance"
with other anti-fascist parties and unions and rejected its pre-war
policy of "unity from below." The CNT and FAI leadership decided not to
talk of libertarian communism but only of the fight against fascism. A
greater mistake they could not have made.

An anarchist approach in the aftermath of the fascist uprising would
have meant replacing the Generalitat with a federal assembly of
delegates from workplace and local community assemblies (a Defence
Council, to use a CNT expression). Only popular assemblies (not
political parties) would be represented (parties would have an influence
only in proportion to their influence in the basic assemblies). All the
CNT would have had do was to call a Regional Congress of unions and
invite the UGT, independent unions and unorganised workplaces to send
delegates to create the framework of this system. This, we must stress,
was **not** done. We will discuss why in [section
20](append32.html#app20) and so will refrain from doing so here.
However, **because** the CNT in effect "postponed" the political aspects
of the social revolution (namely, to quote Kropotkin, to *"smash the
State and replace it with the Federation [of Communes]"* [**No Gods, No
Masters**, vol. 1, p. 259]) the natural result would be exactly as
Morrow explains:

> *"But isn't it a far cry from the failure to create the organs to
> overthrow the bourgeoisie, to the acceptance of the role of class
> collaboration with the bourgeoisie? Not at all . . . Without
> developing soviets -- workers' councils -- it was inevitable that even
> the anarchists and the POUM would drift into governmental
> collaboration with the bourgeoisie."* [**Op. Cit.**, pp. 88-9]

As Kropotkin predicted, *"there can be no half-way house: either the
Commune is to be absolutely free to endow itself with whatever
institutions it wishes and introduce all reforms and revolutions it may
deem necessary, or else it will remain . . . a mere subsidiary of the
State, chained in its every movement."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 259] Without
an alternative means of co-ordinating the struggle, the CNT would, as
Morrow argued, have little choice but to collaborate with the state.
However, rather than being a product of anarchist theory, as Morrow
states, this came about by **ignoring** that theory (see [section
20](append32.html#app20)).

This can be seen from the false alternative used to justify the CNT's
and FAI's actions -- namely, *"either libertarian communism, which means
anarchist dictatorship, or democracy, which means collaboration."* The
creation of libertarian communism is done **from below** by those
subject to capitalist and statist hierarchy overthrowing those with
power over them by smashing the state machine and replacing it with
self-managed organisations as well as expropriating capital and placing
it under workers' self-management. As Murray Bookchin argues:

> *"Underlying all [the] errors [of the CNT], at least in theoretical
> terms, was the CNT-FAI's absurd notion that if it assumed power in the
> areas it controlled, it was establishing a 'State.' As long as the

> dictatorship' reveals the incredible confusion that filled the minds
> of the 'influential militants.'"* [*"Looking Back at Spain,"* pp.
> 53-96, **The Radical Papers**, pp. 86-7]

This perspective explains why anarchists do not see any fundamental
difference between a so-called "workers' state" and the existing state.
For anarchists, the state is based fundamentally on hierarchical power
-- the delegation of power into the hands of a few, of a government, of
an "executive" committee. Unlike Lenin, who stressed the "bodies of
armed men" aspect of the state, anarchists consider the real question as
one of who will tell these "bodies of armed men" what to do. Will it be
the people as a whole (as expressed through their self-managed
organisations) or will be it a government (perhaps elected by
representative organisations)?

If it **was** simply a question of consolidating a revolution and its
self-defence then there would be no argument:

> *"But perhaps the truth is simply this: . . . [some] take the
> expression 'dictatorship of the proletariat' to mean simply the
> revolutionary action of the workers in taking possession of the land
> and the instruments of labour, and trying to build a society and

>

> [Malatesta, **No Gods, No Masters**, vol. 2, pp. 38-9]

Maurice Brinton sums up the issue well when he argued that *"workers'
power"* *"cannot be identified or equated with the power of the Party --
as it repeatedly was by the Bolsheviks . . . What 'taking power' really
implies is that the vast majority of the working class at last realises
its ability to manage both production and society -- and organises to
this end."* [**The Bolsheviks and Workers' Control**, p. xiv]

The question is, therefore, one of **who** "seizes power" -- will it be
the mass of the population or will it be a party claiming to represent
the mass of the population. The difference is vital -- and anyone who
confuses the issue (like Lenin) does so either out of stupidity or
vested interests.

If it **is** the mass of people then they have to express themselves and
their power (i.e. the power to manage their own affairs). That requires
that individuals -- no matter where they are, be it in the workplace,
community or on the front line -- are part of self-managed
organisations. Only by self-management in functional groups can working
class people be said to controlling their own lives and determining
their own fate. Such a system of popular assemblies and their means of
defence would not be a state in the anarchist sense of the word.

As we argued in [section 12](append32.html#app12), the Trotskyist vision
of revolution, while seeming in some ways similar to that of anarchists,
differ on this question. For Trotskyists, the **party** takes power,
**not** the mass of the population directly. Only if you view
"proletarian" seizure of power in terms of electing a political party to
government could you see the elimination of functional democracy in the
armed forces and the workplaces as no threat to working class power.
Given Trotsky's actual elimination of democracy in the Red Army and Navy
plus his comments on one-man management (and their justifications -- see
sections [11](append32.html#app11) and [17](append32.html#app17)) it is
clear that Trotskyists consider the workers' state in terms of party
government, **not** self-management, **not** functional direct
democracy.

Yes, the Trotskyists do claim that it is the workers, via their soviets,
who will elect the government and hold it accountable but such a
position fails to realise that a social revolution can only be created
from below, by the direct action of the mass of the population. By
delegating power into the hands of a few, the revolution is distorted.
The initiative and power no longer rests in the hands of the mass of the
population and so they can no longer take part in the constructive work
of the revolution **and so it will not reflect their interests and
needs.** As power flows from the top-down, bureaucratic distortions are
inevitable.

Moreover, the government will inevitably clash with its subjects and
Trotskyist theory provides the justification for the government imposing
its wishes and negating workers' democracy (see [section
12](append32.html#app12) for evidence for this claim). Moreover, in the
centralised state desired by Trotskyists democratic accountability will
inevitably suffer as power flows to the top:

> *"The power of the local soviets passed into the hands of the
> [National] Executive Committee, the power of the Executive Committee
> passed into the hands of the Council of People's Commissars, and
> finally, the power of the Council of People's Commissars passed into
> the hands of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party."* [Murray
> Bookchin, **Post-Scarcity Anarchism**, p. 152]

Little wonder, then, these CNT aphorisms:

> *"power corrupts both those who exercise it and those over whom it is
> exercised; those who think they can conquer the State in order to
> destroy it are unaware that the State overcomes all its conquerors. .
> . dictatorship of the proletariat is dictatorship without the
> proletariat and against them."* [Peter Marshall, **Demanding the
> Impossible**, p. 456]

That, in a nut shell, why anarchists consider the workers' state as no
real change from the bourgeois state. Rather than creating a system in
which working class people directly manage their own affairs, the
workers' state, like any other state, involves the delegation of that
power into the hands of a few. Given that state institutions generate
specific social relations, specific relations of authority (namely those
order giver and order taker) they cannot help becoming separated from
society, becoming a new class based on the state's bureaucratic machine.
Any state structure (particularly a highly centralised one, as desired
by Leninists) has a certain independence from society and so serves the
interests of those within the State institutions rather than the people
as a whole.

Perhaps a Leninist will point to **The State and Revolution** as
evidence that Lenin desired a state based round the soviets -- workers'
council -- and so our comments are unjustified. However, as Marx said,
judge people by what they do, not what they say. The first act of the
October Revolution was to form an executive power **over** the soviets
(although, of course, in theory accountable to their national congress).
In **The State and Revolution** Lenin praised Marx's comment that the
Paris Commune was both administrative **and** executive. The "workers'
state" created by Lenin did not follow that model (as Russian
anarcho-syndicalists argued in August 1918, *"the Soviet of People's
Commissars [i]s an organ which does not stem from the soviet structure
but only interferes with its work"* [**The Anarchists in the Russian
Revolution**, p. 118]).

Thus the Bolshevik state was not based around soviet self-management
**nor** the fusion of executive and administrative in their hands but
rather the use of the soviets to elect a government (a separate
executive) which had the real power. The issue is quite simple -- either
*"All power to the Soviets"* means just that or it means *"All power to
the government elected by the Soviets"*. The two are not the same as the
first, for the obvious reason that in the second the soviets become
simply ratification machines for the government and not organs in which
the working masses can run their own affairs. We must also point out
that the other promises made in Lenin's book went the same way as his
support for the combining administration and executive tasks in the
Paris Commune -- and, we stress, all **before** the Civil War started in
May 1918 (the usual Trotskyist defence of such betrayals is blame the
Civil War which is hard to do as it had not started yet).

So it is unsurprising that Morrow does not explain why anarchists reject
the "dictatorship of the proletariat" -- to do so would be to show that
Trotskyism is not the revolutionary movement for workers' liberty it
likes to claim it is. Moreover, it would involve giving an objective
account of anarchist theory and admitting that the CNT did not follow
its teachings.

14. What is wrong with Morrow's *"fundamental tenet"* of anarchism?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

According to Morrow the *"second fundamental tenet in anarchist
teaching"* is, apparently, the following:

> *"Since Bakunin, the anarchists had accused Marxists of
> over-estimating the importance of state power, and had characterised
> this as merely the reflection of the petty-bourgeois intellectuals'
> pre-occupation with lucrative administrative posts. Anarchism calls
> upon workers to turn their backs on the state and seek control of the
> factories as the real source of power. The ultimate sources of power
> (property relations) being secured, the state power will collapse,
> never to be replaced."*

He then sums up by stating the Spanish anarchists *"thus failed to
understand that it was only the collapse of state power . . . which had
enabled them to seize the factories."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 102]

It would be interesting to discover in what work of Bakunin, or any
anarchist, such a position could be found. Morrow gives us no references
to help us in our quest -- hardly surprising as no anarchist (Spanish or
otherwise) ever argued this point before July 1936. However, in
September 1936, we discover the CNT arguing that the *"withering away of
the State is socialism's ultimate objective. Facts have demonstrated
that in practice it is achieved by liquidation of the bourgeois State,
brought to a state of asphyxiation by economic expropriation."* [**No
Gods, No Masters**, vol. 2, p. 261] This, we must note, was the same
month the CNT decided to join the Catalan Government! So much for the
state having withered away.

However, will soon be made clear, such comments were a revision of
anarchist theory brought about by the apparent victory of the CNT on
July 19th, 1936 (just as other revisions occurred to justify CNT
participation in the state). In other words, Morrow's *"second
fundamental tenet"* does not exist in anarchist theory. To prove this,
we will quote Bakunin and a few other famous anarchists as well as
giving an overview of some of the insurrections organised by the CNT
before 1936. We start with Bakunin, Kropotkin and Malatesta.

Given that Bakunin thought that it was the *"power of the State"* which
*"sustains the privileged classes"* against the *"legitimate indignation
of the masses of the people"* it is hard to know what Morrow is talking
about. [**The Political Philosophy of Bakunin**, p. 196] Given this
perspective, it naturally follows that to abolish capitalism, to allow
the seizure of factories by the workers, the state had to be abolished
(or *"destroyed"*). Equally clear is that the *"natural and necessary
consequence of this destruction will be . . . [among others, the]
dissolution of army, magistracy, bureaucracy, police and priesthood. . .
confiscation of all productive capital and means of production on behalf
of workers' associations, who are to put them to use . . . the
federative Alliance of all working men's associations . . . will
constitute the Commune."* [**Michael Bakunin: Selected Writings** p. 253
and p. 170]

Thus, the state has to be abolished in order to ensure that workers' can
take over the means of production, so abolishing capitalism. This is the
**direct opposite** of Morrow's claim that *"[s]ince Bakunin"* anarchism
had *"call[ed] upon the workers to turn their backs to the state and
seek control of the factories as the real source of power."* While
control of the economy by workers is an important, indeed a key, aspect
of a social revolution it is not a sufficient one for anarchists. It
must be combined with the destruction of the state (as Bakunin argued,
*"[n]o revolution could succeed . . . today unless it was simultaneously
a political and a social revolution"* [**No Gods, No Masters**, vol. 1,
p. 141]). As the power of the state *"sustains"* the capitalists it
clearly follows that the capitalist only has his property because the
state protects his property claims -- without the state, workers' would
seize the means of production. Which means, contra Morrow, Bakunin was
aware that in order for workers' to take over their workplaces the state
had to be destroyed as it was by means of the state that capitalist
property rights are enforced.

And, just to stress the obvious, you cannot *"turn your backs on the
state"* while dissolving the state bureaucracy, the army, police and so
on. This is clear for Bakunin. He argued that *"[l]iberty can only be
created by liberty, by an insurrection of all the people and the
voluntary organisation of the workers from below upward."* And the
nature of this workers' organisation? Workers' councils -- the
*"proletariat . . . must enter the International [Workers' Association]
en masse, form[ing] factory, artisan, and agrarian sections, and unite
them into local federations."* [**Statism and Anarchy**, p. 179 and p.
49]

Similarly, we discover Kropotkin arguing that *"expropriation"* would
occur at the same time as *"the capitalists' power to resist [had] been
smashed"* and that *"the authorities"* will be *"overthrown."* [**No
Gods, No Masters**, vol. 1, p. 232 and p. 233] He also recognised the
need for self-defence, arguing that the revolution must *"withstand both
the attempts to form a government that would seek to strangle it and any
onslaughts which may emanate from without."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 232] He
argued the Commune *"must smash the State and replace it with the
Federation and it will act accordingly."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 259] You
cannot do all this by *"turning your backs"* on the state. To smash the
state you need to face it and fight it -- there is no other way.

Elsewhere he argued that the commune of the future would base itself on
*"the principles of anarchist communism"* and *"entirely abolish . . .
property, government, and the state."* They will *"proclaim and
establish their independence by direct socialist revolutionary action,
abolishing private property"* when *"governments are swept away by the
people . . . the insurgent people will not wait until some new
government decrees, in its marvellous wisdom, a few economic reforms."*
Rather, they *"will take possession on the spot and establish their
rights by utilising it without delay. They will organise themselves in
the workshops to continue the work, but what they will produce will be
what is wanted by the masses, not what gives the highest profit to
employers. . . they will organise themselves to turn to immediate use
the wealth stored up in the towns; they will take possession of it as if
it had never been stolen from them by the middle class."* [**The Commune
of Paris**] Note that Kropotkin explicitly states that only **after**
*"governments are swept away"* would the *"insurgent people . . .
organise themselves in the workshops."*

As Malatesta noted, the anarchist principles formulated in 1872 at the
Congress of St Imier (under the influence of Bakunin, obviously) stated
that *"[d]estruction of all political power is the first duty of the
proletariat"* who must *"establish solidarity in revolutionary action
outside the framework of bourgeois politics."* He adds, *"[n]eedless to
say, for the delegates of St. Imier as for us and for all anarchists,
the abolition of political power is not possible without the
simultaneous destruction of economic privilege."* [**Life and Ideas**,
pp. 157-8]

Malatesta himself always stressed that revolution required *"the
insurrectionary act which sweeps away the material obstacles, the armed
forces of the government."* He argued that *"[o]nce the government has
been overthrown . . . it will be the task of the people . . . to provide
for the satisfaction of immediate needs and to prepare for the future by
destroying privileges and harmful institutions."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 163
and p. 161] In other words, the revolution needs to smash the state and
at the same time abolish capitalism by expropriation by the workers.

Thus anarchism is clear on that you need to destroy the state in order
to expropriate capital. Morrow's assertions on this are clearly false.
Rather than urging *"workers to turn their backs on the state and seek
control of the factories as the real source of power"* anarchism calls
upon workers to *"overthrow,"* *"smash,"* *"sweep away,"* *"destroy"*,
*"dissolve"* the state and its bureaucratic machinery via an
*"insurrectionary act"* and expropriate capital **at the same time** --
in other words, a popular uprising probably combined with a general
strike (*"an excellent means for starting the social revolution,"* in
Malatesta's words, but not in itself enough to made *"armed insurrection
unnecessary"* [Errico Malatesta, **The Anarchist Reader**, pp. 224-5]).

That, in itself, indicates that Morrow's *"fundamental tenet"* of
anarchism does not, in fact, actually exist. In addition, if we look at
the history of the CNT during the 1930s we discover that the union
organised numerous insurrections which did not, in fact, involve workers
*"turning their backs on the state"* but rather attacking the state. For
example, in the spontaneous revolt of CNT miners in January 1932, the
workers *"seized town halls, raised the black-and-red flags of the CNT,
and declared **communismo liberatario.**"* In Tarassa, the same year,
the workers again *"seiz[ed] town halls"* and the town *"swept by street
fighting."* The revolt in January 1933 began with *"assaults by
Anarchist action groups . . . on Barcelona's military barracks . . .
Serious fighting occurred in working-class **barrios** and the outlying
areas of Barcelona . . . Uprising occurred in Tarassa,
Sardanola-Ripollet, Lerida, in several **pueblos** in Valencia province,
and in Andalusia."* In Casas Viejas, as we discussed in [section
1](append32.html#app1), the CNT members surrounded and attacked the
barracks of the Civil Guard. In December 1933, the workers *"reared
barricades, attacked public buildings, and engaged in heavy street
fighting . . . many villages declared libertarian communism."* [Murray
Bookchin, **The Spanish Anarchists**, p. 225, p. 226, p. 227 and p. 238]

Moreover, *"[w]herever possible . . . insurrections had carried out
industrial and agrarian take-overs and established committees for
workers' and peasant's control, libertarian systems of logistics and
distribution -- in short, a miniature society 'organised on the lines
set down by Kropotkin.'"* [Bookchin, **Op. Cit.**, p. 239]

Now, does all that really sound like workers turning their backs on the
state and only seizing control of their factories?

Perhaps it will be argued that Morrow is referring to **after** the
insurrection (although he clearly is not). What about the defence of the
revolution? Anarchists have always been clear on this too -- the
revolution would be defended by the people in arms. We have discussed
this issue above (in sections [1](append32.html#app1) and
[8](append32.html#app8) in particular) so we do not need to discuss it
in much detail here. We will just provide another quote by Bakunin
(although written in 1865, Bakunin made the same points over and over
again until his death in 1876):

> *"While it [the revolution] will be carried out locally everywhere,
> the revolution will of necessity take a federalist format. Immediately
> after established government has been overthrown, communes will have
> to reorganise themselves along revolutionary lines . . . In order to
> defend the revolution, their volunteers will at the same time form a
> communal militia. But no commune can defend itself in isolation. So it
> will be necessary for each of them to radiate outwards, to raise all
> its neighbouring communes in revolt . . . and to federate with them
> for common defence."* [**No Gods, No Masters**, vol. 1, p. 142]

This was essentially the position agreed by the CNT in May 1936:

> *"The armed people will be the best guarantee against all attempts to
> restore the destroyed regime by interior or exterior forces . . . Each
> Commune should have its arms and elements of defence."* [quoted by
> Robert Alexander, **The Anarchists in the Spanish Civil War**, vol. 1,
> p. 64]

Like the CNT with its *"Defence Committees"* the defence of the
revolution would rest with the commune and its federation. Thus Morrow's
*"fundamental tenet"* of anarchism does not exist. We have **never**
urged the ignoring of the state nor the idea that seizing economic power
will eliminate political power by itself. Nor is anarchism against the
defence of a revolution. The position of the CNT in May 1936 was
identical to that of Bakunin in 1865. The question is, of course, how do
you organise a revolution and its defence -- is it by the whole people
or is it by a party representing that people. Anarchists argue for the
former, Trotskyists the latter. Needless to say, a state structure (i.e.
a centralised, hierarchical structure based on the delegation of power)
is required only when a revolution is seen as rule by a party -- little
wonder anarchists reject the concept of a "workers' state" as a
contradiction in terms.

The question of July 1936 however rears its head. If anarchism **does**
stand for insurrection, workers councils and so on, then why did the CNT
ignore the state? Surely that suggests anarchism is, as Morrow claims,
flawed? No, it does not -- as we argue in some detail in [section
20](append32.html#app20) this confuses mistakes by **anarchists** with
errors in anarchist theory. The CNT-FAI did not pursue anarchist theory
and so July 1936 does not invalidate anarchism. As Bakunin argued,
*"[n]o revolution could succeed . . . unless it was simultaneously a
political and a social revolution."* [**No Gods, No Masters**, vol. 1,
p. 141] The revolution of July 1936 was a social revolution (it
expropriated capital and revolutionised social relationships across
society) but it was not a political revolution -- in other words, it did
not destroy the state. The CNT refused to do this because of the danger
of fascism and fear of isolation (see [section
20](append32.html#app20)). Little wonder the social revolution was
defeated -- the CNT did not apply basic anarchist theory. To dismiss
anarchist ideas because they were not applied seems somewhat strange.

To finish this section we must indicate that Morrow's statement
concerning anarchists "turning our backs" to the state and concentrating
on property actually contradicts both Engels and Lenin.

As Lenin notes in **The State and Revolution**, *"Marx agreed with
Proudhon on the necessity of 'smashing' the present state machine. . .
[there is] similarity between Marxism and anarchism (Proudhon and
Bakunin) . . . on this point"* and that anarchists advocate *"the
destruction of the state machine."* [**Essential Works of Lenin**, p.
310 and p. 358] You can hardly smash the state or destroy the state
machine by "turning your back" to it. Similarly, Engels argued (although
distorting his thought somewhat) that Bakunin saw *"the **state** as the
main evil to be abolished . . . [and] maintains that it is the **state**
which has created capital, that the capitalist has his capital **only by
the grace of the state** . . . [Hence] it is above all the state which
must be done away with . . . organise, and when ALL workers are won over
. . . abolish the state and replace it with the organisation of the
International."* [**The Marx-Engels Reader**, pp. 728-9] You cannot
*"abolish"* and *"replace"* the state by ignoring it ("turning your back
to it"). We must also stress that Engels comments disprove Lenin's
assertion that anarchists *"have absolutely no clear idea of **what**
the proletariat will put in its [the states] place."* [**Op. Cit.**, p.
358] We have always been clear, namely a federation of workers'
associations (this was the organisation of the First International). In
other, more modern, words, a system of workers' councils -- a position
Marxists only embraced six decades later when Lenin advocated them as
the basis of his "workers' state."

Thus Morrow's comments against anarchism are in contradiction to usual
Marxist claims against anarchism (namely, that we seek to smash the
state but do not understand that the workers' state is necessary to
abolish capitalism). Indeed, Engels attributed the opposite idea to
Bakunin that Morrow implies anarchists think with regards to property --
namely the idea that the capitalist has his property because of the
state. Morrow's *"fundamental tenet"* of anarchism not only does not
exist in anarchist theory, it does not even exist in the Marxist
critique of that theory! It is impressive enough to assign a false
doctrine to your enemies, it takes real ability to make a claim which
contradicts your own theory's assertions!

15. Did Spanish Anarchism aim for the creation of *"collectives"* before the revolution?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The formation of the worker-managed enterprises called *"collectives"*
in the Spanish revolution of 1936 has sometimes led people (particularly
Marxists) to misconceptions about anarcho-syndicalist and
communist-anarchist theory. These comments by a Marxist-Leninist are
typical:

> *"Spanish anarchists believed that a system of autonomous collectives,
> with the weakest possible connections between them, was the
> alternative to capitalism and also to the Marxist view of society
> running the entire economy as one whole."*

And:

> *"The anarchist theory led to the ordinary anarchist considering each
> factory as owned simply by the workers that laboured there, and not by
> the working class as a whole."* [Joseph Green, *"The Black Autonomy
> Collective and the Spanish Civil War"*, **Communist Voice** no. 10,
> Vol. 2, no. 5, Oct. 1, 1996]

This assertion is sometimes voiced by Libertarian Marxists of the
council communist tendency (who should know better):

> *"At the time of the Civil War, a popular idea amongst the Spanish
> working class and peasants was that each factory, area of land, etc.,
> should be owned collectively by its workers, and that these
> 'collectives' should be linked with each other on a 'federal' basis -
> that is, without any superior central authority.*
>
> "This basic idea had been propagated by anarchists in Spain for more
> than 50 years. When the Civil War began, peasants and working class
> people in those parts of the country which had not immediately fallen
> under fascist control seized the opportunity to turn anarchist ideal
> into reality." [*"Anarchism and the Spanish 'Revolution'"*,
> **Subversion** no. 18]

Trotskyist Felix Morrow also presents a similar analysis when he states
that the POUM *"recorded the tendency of CNT unions to treat
collectivised property as their own. It never attacked the
anarcho-syndicalist theories which created the tendency."* [**Op.
Cit.**, p. 104]

However, the truth of the matter is somewhat different.

Firstly, as will soon become clear, CNT policy and anarchist theory was
**not** in favour of workers' owning their individual workplaces.
Instead both argued for **socialisation** of the means of life by a
system of federations of workers' assemblies. Individual workplaces
would be managed by their workers but they would not exist in isolation
or independently of the others -- they would be members of various
federations (minimally an industrial one and one which united all
workplaces regardless of industry in a geographical area). These would
facilitate co-ordination and co-operation between self-managed
workplaces. The workplace would, indeed, be autonomous but such autonomy
did not negate the need for federal organs of co-ordination nor did
federation negate that autonomy (as we will discuss later in [section
18](append32.html#app18), autonomy means the ability to make agreements
with others and so joining a federation is an expression of autonomy and
not necessarily its abandonment, it depends on the nature of the
federation).

Secondly, rather than being the product of *"more than 50 years"* of
anarchist propaganda or of *"anarcho-syndicalist theories"*, the
*"collectives"* instituted during the Civil War were seen by the CNT as
merely a temporary stop-gap. They had not been advocated in the CNT's
pre-Civil War program, but came into existence precisely because the CNT
was unable to carry out its libertarian communist program, which would
have required setting up workers congresses and federal councils to
establish co-ordination and aid the planning of common activities
between the self-managed workplaces. In other words, the idea of
self-managed workplaces was seen as one step in a process of
socialisation, the basic building block of a federal structure of
workers' councils. They were **not** seen as an end in themselves no
matter how important they were as the base of a socialised economy.

Thus the CNT had never proposed that factories or other facilities would
be owned by the people who happened to work there. The CNT's program
called for the construction of *"libertarian communism."* This was the
CNT's agreed goal, recognising it must be freely created from below. In
addition, the Spanish Anarchists argued for *"free experimentation, free
show of initiative and suggestions, as well as the freedom of
organisation,"* recognising that *"[i]n each locality the degree of
[libertarian] communism, collectivism or mutualism will depend on
conditions prevailing. Why dictate rules? We who make freedom our
banner, cannot deny it in economy."* [D. A. de Santillan, **After the
Revolution**, p. 97] In other words, the CNT recognised that libertarian
communism would not be created overnight and different areas will
develop at different speeds and in different directions depending on the
material circumstances they faced and what their population desired.

However, libertarian communism was the CNTs declared goal. This meant
that the CNT aimed for a situation where the economy as a whole would be
socialised and **not** an mutualist economy consisting independent
co-operatives owned and controlled by their workers (with the producers
operating totally independently of each other on the basis of market
exchange). Instead, workers would manage their workplace directly, but
would not own it -- rather ownership would rest with society as a whole
but the day-to-day management of the means of production would be
delegated to those who did the actual work. Councils of workers'
delegates, mandated by and accountable to workplace assemblies, would be
created to co-ordinate activity at all levels of the economy.

A few quotes will be needed to show that this was, in fact, the position
of the Spanish Anarchists. According to Issac Puente, the *"national
federations will hold as common property all the roads, railways,
buildings, equipment, machinery and workshops."* The village commune
*"will federate with its counterparts in other localities and with the
national industrial federations."* [**Libertarian Communism**, p. 29 and
p. 26] In D. A. de Santillan's vision, libertarian communism would see
workers' councils overseeing 18 industrial sectors. There would also be
*"councils of the economy"* for local, regional and national levels
(ultimately, international as well). [**Op. Cit.**, pp. 50-1 and pp.
80-7] These councils would be *"constitute[d] by delegations or through
assemblies"* and *"receives [their] orientation from below and operates
in accordance with the resolutions"* of their appropriate
*"assemblies."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 83 and p. 86]

The CNT's national conference in Saragossa during May 1936 stressed this
vision. Its resolution declared that the revolution would abolish
*"private property, the State, the principle of authority, and . . .
classes."* It argued that *"the economic plan of organisation,
throughout national production, will adjust to the strictest principles
of social economy, directly administered by the producers through their
various organs of production, designated in general assemblies of the
various organisations, and always controlled by them."* In urban areas,
*"the workshop or factory council"* would make *"pacts with other labour
centres"* via *"Councils of Statistics and Production"* which are the
*"organ of relations of Union to Union (association of producers)"*, in
other words, workers' councils. These would *"federate among themselves,
forming a network of constant and close relations among all the
producers of the Iberian Confederation."* In rural areas, *"the
producers of the Commune"* would create a *"Council of Cultivation"*
which would *"establish the same network of relations as the Workshop,
Factory Councils and those of Production and Statistics, complementing
the free federation represented by the Commune."*

The resolution argues that *"[b]oth the Associations of industrial
producers and Associations of agricultural producers will federate
nationally"* and *"Communes will federate on a county and regional basis
. . . Together these Communes will constitute an Iberian Confederation
of Autonomous Libertarian Communes."* Being anarchists, the CNT stressed
that *"[n]one of these organs will have executive or bureaucratic
character"* and their members *"will carry out their mission as
producers, meeting after the work day to discuss questions of details
which don't require the decision of the communal assemblies."* The
assemblies themselves *"will meet as often as needed by the interests of
the Commune. . . When problems are dealt with which affect a country or
province, it must be the Federations which deliberate, and in the
meetings and assemblies all Communities will be represented and the
delegates will bring points of view previously agreed upon"* by the
Commune assembly. [quoted by Robert Alexander, **The Anarchists in the
Spanish Revolution**, vol. 1, p. 59, p. 60 and p. 62]

Joan Ferrer, a bookkeeper who was the secretary of the CNT commercial
workers union in Barcelona, explained this vision:

> *"It was our idea in the CNT that everything should start from the
> worker, not -- as with the Communists -- that everything should be run
> by the state. To this end we wanted to set up industrial federations
> -- textiles, metal-working, department stores, etc. -- which would be
> represented on an overall Economics Council which would direct the
> economy. Everything, including economic planning, would thus remain in
> the hands of the workers."* [quoted by Ronald Fraser, **Blood of
> Spain**, p. 180]

However, social revolution is a dynamic process and things rarely
develop exactly as predicted or hoped in pre-revolutionary times. The
"collectives" in Spain are an example of this. Although the regional
union conferences in Catalonia had put off overthrowing the government
in July of 1936, workers began taking over the management of industries
as soon as the street-fighting had died down. The initiative for this
did not come from the higher bodies -- the regional and national
committees -- but from the rank-and-file activists in the local unions.
In some cases this happened because the top management of the enterprise
had fled and it was necessary for the workers to take over if production
was to continue. But in many cases the local union militants decided to
take advantage of the situation to end wage labour by creating
self-managed workplaces.

As to be expected of a real movement, mistakes were made by those
involved and the development of the movement reflected the real problems
the workers faced and their general level of consciousness and what they
wanted. This is natural and to denounce such developments in favour of
ideal solutions means to misunderstand the dynamic of a revolutionary
situation. In the words of Malatesta:

> *"To organise a [libertarian] communist society on a large scale it
> would be necessary to transform all economic life radically, such as
> methods of production, of exchange and consumption; and all this could
> not be achieved other than gradually, as the objective circumstances
> permitted and to the extent that the masses understood what advantages
> could be gained and were able to act for themselves."* [**Life and
> Ideas**, p. 36]

This was the situation in revolutionary Spain. Moreover, the situation
was complicated by the continued existence of the bourgeois state. As
Gaston Leval, in his justly famous study of the collectives, states *"it
was not . . . true socialisation, but . . . a self-management straddling
capitalism and socialism, which we maintain would not have occurred had
the Revolution been able to extend itself fully under the direction of
our syndicates."* [Gaston Leval, **Collectives in the Spanish
Revolution**, p. 227-8] Leval in fact terms it *"a form of workers
neo-capitalism"* but such a description is inaccurate (and unfortunate)
simply because wage labour had been abolished and so it was not a form
of capitalism -- rather it was a form of mutualism, of workers'
co-operatives exchanging the product of their labour on the market.

However, Leval basic argument was correct -- due to the fact the
political aspect of the revolution (the abolition of the state) had been
"postponed" until after the defeat of fascism, the economic aspects of
the revolution would also remain incomplete. The unions that had seized
workplaces were confronted with a dilemma. They had control of their
individual workplaces, but the original libertarian plan for economic
co-ordination was precluded by the continued existence of the State. It
was in this context of a partial revolution, under attack by the
counter-revolution, that the idea of "collectives" was first put forward
to solve some of the problems facing the workers and their self-managed
workplaces. Unfortunately, this very "solution" caused problems of its
own. For example, Gaston Leval indicates that the collectivisation
decree of October 1936 *"legalising collectivisation"*, *"distorted
everything right from the start"* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 227] and did not
allow the collectives to develop beyond a mutualist condition into full
libertarian communism. It basically legalised the existing situation
while hindering its development towards libertarian communism by
undermining union control.

This dilemma of self-managed individual workplaces and lack of
federations to co-ordinate them was debated at a CNT union plenary in
September of 1936. The idea of converting the worker-managed workplaces
into co-operatives, operating in a market economy, had never been
advocated by the Spanish anarchists before the Civil War, but was now
seen by some as a temporary stop-gap that would solve the immediate
question of what to do with the workplaces that had been seized by the
workers. It was at this meeting that the term "collective" was first
adopted to describe this solution. This concept of "collectivisation"
was suggested by Joan Fabregas, a Catalan nationalist of middle class
origin who had joined the CNT after July of 1936. As one CNT militant
recalled:

> *"Up to that moment, I had never heard of collectivisation as a
> solution for industry -- the department stores were being run by the
> union. What the new system meant was that each collectivised firm
> would retain its individual character, but with the ultimate objective
> of federating all enterprises within the same industry."* [quoted by
> Ronald Fraser, **Blood of Spain**, p. 212]

However, a number of unions went beyond "collectivisation" and took over
all the facilities in their industries, eliminating competition between
separate firms. The many small barber and beauty shops in Barcelona were
shut down and replaced with large neighbourhood haircutting centres, run
through the assemblies of the CNT barbers' union. The CNT bakers union
did something similar. The CNT Wood Industry Union shut down the many
small cabinet-making shops, where conditions were often dangerous and
unhealthy. They were replaced with two large factories, which included
new facilities for the benefit of the workforce, such as a large
swimming pool.

The union ran the entire industry, from the felling of timber in the Val
d'Aran to the furniture showrooms in Barcelona. The railway, maritime
shipping and water, gas and electric industry unions also pursued this
strategy of industrial unification, as did the textile union in the
industrial town of Badalona, outside Barcelona. This was considered to
be a step in the direction of eventual socialisation.

At the Catalan union plenary of September, 1936, *"the bigger, more
powerful unions, like the woodworkers, the transport workers, the public
entertainment union, all of which had already socialised [i.e. unified
their industries under union management], wanted to extend their
solution to the rest of industry. The smaller, weaker unions wanted to
form co-operatives. . ."* [Fraser, **Op. Cit.**, p. 212]

The collectives came out of this conflict and discussion as a sort of
"middle ground" -- however, it should be stressed that it did not stop
many unions from ignoring the Catalan's governments' attempt to legalise
(and so control) the collectives (the so-called *"collectivisation"*
decree) as far as they could. As Albert Perez-Baro, a Catalan Civil
Servant noted, *"the CNT . . . pursued its own, unilateral objectives
which were different. Syndical collectivisation or syndicalised
collectives, I would call those objectives; that's to say, collectives
run by their respective unions . . . The CNT's policy was thus not the
same as that pursued by the decree."* [quoted by Fraser, **Op. Cit.**,
pp. 212-3] Indeed, Abad de Santillan stated later that he *"was an enemy
of the decree because I considered it premature . . . When I became
[economics] councillor [of the Generalitat for the CNT], I had no
intention of taking into account of carrying out the decree; I intended
to allow our great people to carry on the task as they saw fit,
according to their own aspiration."* [quoted, **Op. Cit.**, p. 212f]

Therefore, when Leninist Joseph Green argues the initial
collectivisation of workplaces *"was the masses starting to take things
into their own hands, and they showed that they could continue
production in their workplaces . . . The taking over of the individual
workplaces and communities is one step in a revolutionary process. But
there is yet more that must be done -- the workplaces and communities
must be integrated into an overall economy"* he is just showing his
ignorance. The CNT, despite Green's assertions to the contrary, were
well aware that the initial collectivisations were just one step in the
revolution and were acting appropriately. It takes some gall (or extreme
ignorance) to claim that CNT theory, policy and actions were, in fact,
the exact opposite of what they were. Similarly, when he argues *"[h]ow
did the anarchists relate the various workplace collectives to each
other in Barcelona? . . . they made use of a patchwork system including
a Central Labour Bank, an Economic Council, credit . . ."* he strangely
fails to mention the socialisation attempts made by many CNT industrial
unions during the revolution, attempts which reflected pre-war CNT
policy. But such facts would get in the way of a political diatribe and
so are ignored. [Green, **Op. Cit.**]

Green continues his inaccurate diatribe by arguing that:

> *"The problem is that, saddled with their false theory, they could not
> understand the real nature of the economic steps taken in the
> collectives, and thus they could not deal with the economic relations
> that arose among the collectives."* [**Op. Cit.**]

However, the only thing false about this is the false assertions
concerning anarchist theory. As is crystal clear from our comments
above, the Spanish anarchists (like all anarchists) were well aware of
the need for economic relations between collectives (self-managed
workplaces) before the revolution and acted to create them during it.
These were the industrial federations and federations of rural
communities/collectives predicted in anarchist and CNT theory and
actually created, in part at least, during the revolution itself.

Thus Green's "critique" of anarchism is, in fact, **exactly** what
anarchist theory actually argues and what the Spanish anarchists
themselves argued and tried to implement in all industries. Of course,
there are fundamental differences between the anarchist vision of
socialisation and the Leninist vision of Nationalisation but this does
not mean that anarchism is blind to the necessity of integrating
workplaces and communities into a coherent system of federations of
workers' councils (as proven above). However, such federation has two
sources -- it is either imposed from above or agreed to from below.
Anarchists choose the former as the latter negates any claim that a
revolution is a popular, mass movement from below (and, incidentally,
the Leninist claim that the "workers' state" is simply a tool of the
workers to defeat capitalist oppression).

The actual process in Spain towards industrial federations and so
socialisation was dependent on the wishes of the workers involved -- as
would be expected in a true social revolution. For example, the
department stores were collectivised and an attempt to federate the
stores failed. The works councils opposed it, considering the
enterprises as their own and were unwilling to join a federation -- the
general assemblies of the collectives agreed. Joan Ferrer, the secretary
of the CNT commercial union, considered it natural as *"[o]nly a few
months before, the traditional relationship between employer and worker
had been overthrown. Now the workers were being asked to make a new leap
-- to the concept of collective ownership. It was asking a lot to expect
the latter to happen overnight."* [quoted by Fraser, **Op. Cit.**, p.
220]

However, before Leninists like Green rush in and assert that this proves
that *"anarchist theory led to the ordinary anarchist considering each
factory as owned simply by the workers that laboured there"* we should
point out two things. Firstly, it was the "ordinary anarchists" who were
trying to organise socialisation (i.e. CNT members and militants).
Secondly, the Russian Revolution also saw workers taking over their
workplaces and treating them as their own property. Leninists like Green
would have a fit if we took these examples to "prove" that Leninism
*"led to the ordinary Bolshevik worker considering each factory as owned
simply by the workers that laboured there"* (which was what the
Mensheviks **did** argue in 1917 when Martov *"blamed the Bolsheviks for
creating the local, particularistic attitudes prevailing among the
masses."* [Samuel Farber, **Before Stalinism**, p. 72]). In other words,
such events are a natural part of the process of a revolution and are to
be expected regardless of the dominant theory in that revolution.

To summarise.

The Spanish revolution does confirm anarchist theory and in no way
contradicts it. While many of the aspects of the collectives were in
accord with pre-war CNT policy and anarchist theory, other aspects of
them were in contradiction to them. This was seen by the militants of
the CNT and FAI who worked to transform these spontaneously created
organs of economic self-management into parts of a socialised economy as
required for libertarian communism. Such a transformation flowed from
below and was not imposed from above, as would be expected in a
libertarian social revolution.

As can be seen, the standard Marxist account of the collectives and its
relationship to anarchist theory and CNT policy is simply wrong.

16. How does the development of the collectives indicate the differences between Bolshevism and anarchism?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As argued in the [last section](append32.html#app15), the collectives
formed during the Spanish Revolution reflected certain aspects of
anarchist theory but not others. They were a compromise solution brought
upon by the development of the revolution and did not, as such, reflect
CNT or anarchist theory or vision bar being self-managed by their
workers. The militants of the CNT and FAI tried to convince their
members to federate together and truly socialise the economy, with
various degrees of success. A similar process occurred during the
Russian Revolution of 1917. There workers created factory committees
which tried to introduce workers' self-management of production. The
differences in outcome in these two experiences and the actions of the
Bolsheviks and anarchists indicate well the fundamental differences
between the two philosophies. In this section we discuss the contrasting
solutions pursued by the CNT and the Bolsheviks in their respective
revolutions.

The simple fact is that revolutions are complex and dynamic processes
which involve many contradictory developments. The question is how do
you push them forward -- either from below or from above. Both the
Spanish and the Russian revolution were marked by "localism" -- when the
workers in a factory consider it their own property and ignore wider
issues and organisation.

Lenin and the Bolsheviks "solved" the problem of localism by eliminating
workers' self-management in favour of one-man management appointed from
above. Attempts by the workers and factory committees themselves to
combat localism were stopped by the Bolshevik dominated trade unions
which *"prevented the convocation of a planned All-Russian Congress of
Factory Committees"* in November 1917 when *"called upon"* by the
Bolsheviks *"to render a special serve to the nascent Soviet State and
to discipline the Factory Committees."* [I. Deutscher, quoted by Maurice
Brinton, **The Bolsheviks and Workers' Control**, p. 19] Instead, the
Bolsheviks built from the top-down their system of *"unified
administration"* based on converting the Tsarist system of central
bodies which governed and regulated certain industries during the war.
[Brinton, **Op. Cit.**, p. 36] The CNT, in comparison, tried to solve
the problem of localism by a process of discussion and debate from
below. Both were aware of the fact the revolution was progressing in
ways different from their desired goal but their solution reflected
their different politics -- libertarian in the case of the CNT,
authoritarian in the case of Bolshevism.

Therefore, the actual economic aspects of the Spanish revolution
reflected the various degrees of political development in each workplace
and industry. Some industries socialised according to the CNT's pre-war
vision of libertarian communism, others remained at the level of
self-managed workplaces in spite of the theories of the union and
anarchists. This was the case with other aspects of the collectives. As
Vernon Richards points out, *"[i]n some factories . . . the profits or
income were shared out among the workers . . . As a result, wages
fluctuated in different factories and even within the same industry . .
. But fortunately . . . the injustice of this form of collectivisation
was recognised and combated by the CNT syndicates from the beginning."*
[**Lessons of the Spanish Revolution**, pp. 106-7]

Thus the collectives, rather than expressing the economic vision of
communist-anarchism or anarcho-syndicalism, came into existence
precisely because the CNT was unable to carry out its libertarian
communist program, which would have required setting up workers
congresses and co-ordinating councils to establish common ownership and
society wide self-management. To assert that the collectives were an
exact reflection of anarchist or anarcho-syndicalist theory is,
therefore, incorrect. Rather, they reflected certain aspects of that
theory (such as workers' self-management in the workplace) while others
(industrial federations to co-ordinate economic activity, for example)
were only partially meet. This, we must stress, is to be expected as a
revolution is a **process** and not an event. As Kropotkin argued:

> *"It is a whole insurrectionary period of three, four, perhaps five
> years that we must traverse to accomplish our revolution in the
> property system and in social organisation."* [**Words of a Rebel**,
> p. 72]

Thus the divergence of the actual revolution from the program of the CNT
was to be expected and so did not represent a failure or a feature of
anarchist or anarcho-syndicalist theory as Morrow and other Marxists
assert. Rather, it expresses the nature of a social revolution, a
movement from below which, by its very nature, reflects real needs and
problems and subject to change via discussion and debate. Bakunin's
comments stress this aspect of the revolution:

> *"I do not say that the peasants [and workers], freely organised from
> the bottom up, will miraculously create an ideal organisation,
> confirming in all respects to our dreams. But I am convinced that what
> they construct will be living and vibrant, a thousands times better
> and more just than any existing organisation. Moreover, this . . .
> organisation, being on the one hand open to revolutionary propaganda .
> . . , and on the other, not petrified by the intervention of the State
> . . . will develop and perfect itself through free experimentation as
> fully as one can reasonably expect in our times.*
>
> "With the abolition of the State, the spontaneous self-organisation of
> popular life . . . will revert to the communes. The development of
> each commune will take its point of departure the actual condition of
> its civilisation . . ." [**Bakunin on Anarchism**, p. 207]

To **impose** an "ideal" solution would destroy a revolution -- the
actions and decisions (**including what others may consider mistakes**)
of a free people are infinitely more productive and useful than the
decisions and decrees of the best central committee. Moreover, a
centralised system by necessity is an imposed system (as it excludes by
its very nature the participation of the mass of the people in
determining their own fate). As Bakunin argued, *"Collectivism could be
imposed only on slaves, and this kind of collectivism would then be the
negation of humanity. In a free community, collectivism can come about
only through the pressure of circumstances, not by imposition from above
but by a free spontaneous movement from below."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 200]
Thus socialisation must proceed from below, reflecting the real
development and desires of those involved. To "speed-up" the process via
centralisation can only result in replacing socialisation with
nationalisation and the elimination of workers' self-management with
hierarchical management. Workers' again would be reduced to the level of
order-takers, with control over their workplaces resting not in their
hands but in those of the state.

Lenin argued that *"Communism requires and presupposes the greatest
possible centralisation of large-scale production throughout the
country. The all-Russian centre, therefore, should definitely be given
the right of direct control over all the enterprises of the given branch
of industry. The regional centres define their functions depending on
local conditions of life, etc., in accordance with the general
production directions and decisions of the centre."* He continued by
explicitly arguing that *"[t]o deprive the all-Russia centre of the
right to direct control over all the enterprises of the given industry .
. . would be regional anarcho-syndicalism, and not communism."* [Marx,
Engels and Lenin, **Anarchism and Anarcho-Syndicalism**, p. 292]

We expect that Morrow would subscribe to this "solution" to the problems
of a social revolution generates. However, such a system has its own
problems.

First is the basic fallacy that the centre will not start to view the
whole economy as its property (and being centralised, such a body would
be difficult to effectively control). Indeed, Stalin's power was derived
from the state bureaucracy which ran the economy in its own interests.
Not that it suddenly arose with Stalin. It was a feature of the Soviet
system from the start. Samuel Farber, for example, notes that, *"in
practice, [the] hypercentralisation [pursued by the Bolsheviks from
early 1918 onwards] turned into infighting and scrambles for control
among competing bureaucracies"* and he points to the *"not untypical
example of a small condensed milk plant with few than 15 workers that
became the object of a drawn-out competition among six organisations
including the Supreme Council of National Economy, the Council of
People's Commissars of the Northern Region, the Vologda Council of
People's Commissars, and the Petrograd Food Commissariat."* [**Op.
Cit.**, p. 73] In other words, centralised bodies are not immune to
viewing resources as their own property (and compared to an individual
workplace, the state's power to enforce its viewpoint against the rest
of society is considerably stronger).

Secondly, to eliminate the dangers of workers' self-management
generating "propertarian" notions, the workers' have to have their
control over their workplace reduced, if not eliminated. This, by
necessity, generates **bourgeois** social relationships and, equally,
appointment of managers from above (which the Bolsheviks did embrace).
Indeed, by 1920 Lenin was boasting that in 1918 he had *"pointed out the
necessity of recognising the dictatorial authority of single individuals
for the pursue of carrying out the Soviet idea"* and even claimed that
at that stage *"there were no disputes in connection with the question"*
of one-man management. [quoted by Brinton, **Op. Cit.**, p. 65] While
the first claim is true (Lenin argued for one-man management appointed
from above **before** the start of the Civil War in May 1918) the latter
one is **not** true (excluding anarchists and anarcho-syndicalists,
there were also the dissent Left-Communists in the Bolshevik party
itself).

Thirdly, a centralised body effectively excludes the mass participation
of the mass of workers -- power rests in the hands of a few people
which, by its nature, generates bureaucratic rule. This can be seen from
the example of Lenin's Russia. The central bodies the Bolsheviks created
had little knowledge of the local situation and often gave orders that
contradicted each other or had little bearing to reality, so encouraging
factories to ignore the centre. In other words the government's attempts
to centralise actually led to localism (as well as economic
mismanagement)! Perhaps this was what Green means when he argues for a
*"new centralism"* which would be *"compatible with and requiring the
initiative of the workers at the base"* [Green **Op. Cit.**]-- that is,
the initiative of the workers to ignore the central bodies and keep the
economy going **in spite** of the *"new centralism"*?

The simple fact is, a socialist society **must** be created from below,
by the working class itself. If the workers do not know how to create
the necessary conditions for a socialist organisation of labour, no one
else can do it for them or compel them to do it. If the state is used to
combat "localism" and such things then it obviously cannot be in the
hands of the workers' themselves. Socialism can only be created by
workers' own actions and organisations otherwise it will not be set up
at all -- something else will be, namely state capitalism.

Thus, a close look at Lenin's "solution" indicates that Trotskyist claim
that their state is the *"tool of the majority in their fight against
exploitation by the few"* (to use Joseph Green's words) is refuted by
their assertion that this state will also bring the economy under
centralised control and by the actions of the Bolsheviks themselves.

Why is this? Simply because **if** the mass of collectives are not
interested in equality and mutual aid in society as a whole then how can
the government actually be the "tool" of the majority when it imposes
such "mutual aid" and "equality" upon the collectives? In other words,
the interests of the government replace those of the majority. After
all, if workers **did** favour mutual aid and equality then they would
federate themselves to achieve it. (which the collectives were actually
doing all across Spain, we must note). If they do not do this then how
can the "workers' state" be said to be simply their tool when it has to
**impose** the appropriate economic structure upon them? The government
is elected by the whole people, so it will be claimed, and so must be
their tool. This is obviously flawed -- *"if,"* argued Malatesta, *"you
consider these worthy electors as unable to look after their own
interests themselves, how is it that they will know how to choose for
themselves the shepherds who must guide them? And how will they be able
to solve this problem of social alchemy, of producing a genius from the
votes of a mass of fools? And what will happen to the minorities which
are still the most intelligent, most active and radical part of a
society?"* [Malatesta, **Anarchy**, p. 53]

What does all this mean? Simply that Trotskyists recognise, implicitly
at least, that the workers' state is not, in fact, the simple tool of
the workers. Rather, it is the means by which "socialism" will be
imposed upon the workers by the party. If workers do not practice mutual
aid and federation in their day-to-day running of their lives, then how
can the state impose it if it is simply their tool? It suggests what is
desired *"by all of the working people as a whole"* (nearly always a
euphemism for the party in Trotskyist ideology) is different that what
they actually want (as expressed by their actions). In other words, a
conflict exists between the workers' and the so-called "workers' state"
-- in Russia, the party imposed **its** concept of the interests of the
working class, even against the working class itself.

Rather than indicate some kind of failure of anarchist theory, the
experience of workers' self-management in both Spain and Russia indicate
the authoritarian core of Trotskyist ideology. If workers do not
practice mutual aid or federation then a state claiming to represent
them, to be simply their tool, cannot force them to do so without
exposing itself as being an alien body with power **over** the workers.

For these reasons Bakunin was correct to argue that anarchists have *"no
faith except in freedom. Both [Marxists and anarchists], equally
supporters of science which is to destroy superstition and replace
belief, differ in the former wishing to impose it, and the latter
striving to propagate it; so human groups, convinced of its truth, may
organise and federate spontaneously, freely, from the bottom up, by
their own momentum according to their real interests, but never
according to any plan laid down in advance and imposed upon the
**ignorant masses** by some superior intellects."* Anarchists, he
continues, *"think that there is much more practical and intellectual
common sense in the instinctive aspirations and in the real needs of the
mass of the people than in the profound intelligence of all these
doctors and teachers of mankind who, after so many fruitless attempts to
make humanity happy, still aspire to add their own efforts."* [**Michael
Bakunin: Selected Writings**, p. 198]

In summary, the problem of "localism" and any other problems faced by a
social revolution will be solved in the interests of the working class
only if working class people solve them themselves. For this to happen
it requires working class people to manage their own affairs directly
and that implies self-managed organising from the bottom up (i.e.
anarchism) rather than delegating power to a minority at the top, to a
"revolutionary" party or government. This applies economically, socially
and politically. As Bakunin argued, the *"revolution should not only be
made for the people's sake; it should also be made by the people."*
[**No Gods, No Masters**, vol. 1, p. 141]

Thus the actual experience of the collectives and their development,
rather than refuting anarchism, indicates well that it is the only real
form of socialism. Attempts to nationalise the means of production
inevitably disempower workers and eliminate meaningful workers'
self-management or control. It does not eliminate wage labour but rather
changes the name of the boss. Socialism can only be built from below. If
it is not, as the Russian experience indicated, then state capitalism
will be the inevitable outcome.

17. Why is Morrow's support for *"proletarian methods of production"* ironic?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Morrow states *"[i]n the midst of civil war the factory committees are
demonstrating the superiority of proletarian methods of production."*
[**Op. Cit.**, p. 53] This is ironic as the Bolsheviks in power fought
against the factory committees and their attempts to introduce the kind
of workers' self-management Morrow praises in Spain (see Maurice
Brinton's **The Bolsheviks and Workers' Control** for details).
Moreover, rather than seeing workers' self-management as *"proletarian
methods of production"* Lenin and Trotsky thought that how a workplace
was managed was irrelevant under socialism. Trotsky argued that *"[i]t
would be a most crying error to confuse the question as to the supremacy
of the proletariat with the question of boards of workers at the head of
factories. The dictatorship of the proletariat is expressed in the
abolition of private property in the means of production, in the
supremacy of the collective will of the workers [a euphemism for the
Party -- M.B.] and not at all in the form in which individual economic
organisations are administered."* Indeed, *"I consider if the civil war
had not plundered our economic organs of all that was strongest, most
independent, most endowed with initiative, we should undoubtedly have
entered the path of one-man management in the sphere of economic
administration much sooner and much less painfully."* [quoted by Maurice
Brinton, **Op. Cit.**, p. 66 and pp. 66-7]

In other words, Trotsky both in theory and in practice opposed
*"proletarian methods of production"* -- and if the regime introduced by
Trotsky and Lenin in Russia was **not** based on *"proletarian methods
of production"* then what methods was it based on? One-man management
with *"the appointment of individuals, dictators with unlimited powers"*
by the government and *"the people **unquestioningly obey[ing] the
single will** of the leaders of labour."* [**The Immediate Tasks of the
Soviet Government**, p. 32 and p. 34] In other words, the usual
**bourgeois** methods of production with the workers' doing what the
boss tells them. At no time did the Bolsheviks support the kind of
workers' self-management introduced by the anarchist influenced workers
of Spain -- indeed they hindered it and replaced it with one-man
management at the first opportunity (see Maurice Brinton's classic **The
Bolsheviks and Workers' Control** for details).

To point out the obvious, bourgeois methods of production means
bourgeois social relations and relations of production. In other words,
Morrow comments allows us to see that Lenin and Trotsky's regime was not
proletarian at the point of production. How ironic. And if it was not
proletarian at the point of production (i.e. at the source of
**economic** power) how could it remain proletarian at the political
level? Unsurprisingly, it did not -- party power soon replaced workers'
power and the state bureaucracy replaced the party.

Yet again Morrow's book exposes the anti-revolutionary politics of
Trotskyism by allowing anarchists to show the divergence between the
rhetoric of that movement and what it did when it was in power. Morrow,
faced with a workers' movement influenced by anarchism, inadvertently
indicates the poverty of Trotskyism when he praises the accomplishments
of that movement. The reality of Leninism in power was that it
eliminated the very things Morrow praises -- such as *"proletarian
methods of production,"* democratic militias, workers' councils and so
on. Needless to say, the irony of Morrow's work is lost on most of the
Trotskyists who read it.

18. Were the federations of collectives an *"abandonment"* of anarchist ideas?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From our discussion in [section 15](append32.html#app15), it is clear
that anarchism does not deny the need for co-ordination and joint
activity, for federations of self-managed workplaces, industries and
rural collectives at all levels of society. Far from it. As proven in
sections [12](append32.html#app12) and [15](append32.html#app15), such
federations are a basic idea of anarchism. In anarchy co-ordination
flows **from below** and not imposed by a few from above. Unfortunately
Marxists cannot tell the difference between solidarity from below and
unity imposed from above. Morrow, for example, argues that *"the
anarchist majority in the Council of Aragon led in practice to the
abandonment of the anarchist theory of the autonomy of economic
administration. The Council acted as a centralising agency."* [**Op.
Cit.**, pp. 205-6]

Of course it does nothing of the kind. Yes, anarchists are in favour of
autonomy -- including the autonomy of economic administration. We are
also in favour of federalism to co-ordinate join activity and promote
co-operation on a wide-scale (what Morrow would, inaccuracy, call
"centralism" or "centralisation"). Rather than seeing such agreements of
joint activity as the "abandonment" of autonomy, we see it as an
**expression** of that autonomy. It would be a strange form of "freedom"
that suggested making arrangements and agreements with others meant a
restriction of your liberty. For example, no one would argue that to
arrange to meet your friend at a certain place and time meant the
elimination of your autonomy even though it obviously reduces your
"liberty" to be somewhere else at the same time.

Similarly, when an individual joins a group and takes part in its
collective decisions and abides by their decisions, this does not
represent the abandonment of their autonomy. Rather, it is an expression
of their freedom. If we took Morrow's comment seriously then anarchists
would be against all forms of organisation and association as they would
mean the *"abandonment of autonomy"* (of course some Marxists **do**
make that claim, but such a position indicates an essentially
**negative** viewpoint of liberty, a position they normally reject). In
reality, of course, anarchists are aware that freedom is impossible
outside of association. Within an association absolute "autonomy" cannot
exist, but such "autonomy" would restrict freedom to such a degree that
it would be so self-defeating as to make a mockery of the concept of
autonomy and no sane person would seek it.

Of course anarchists are aware that even the best association could turn
into a bureaucracy that **does** restrict freedom. Any organisation
could transform from being an expression of liberty into a bureaucratic
structure which restricts liberty because power concentrates at the top,
into the hands of an elite. That is why we propose specific forms of
organisation, ones based on self-management, decentralisation and
federalism which promote decision-making from the bottom-up and ensure
that the organisation remains in the hands of its members and its
policies are agreements between them rather than ones imposed upon them.
For this reason the basic building block of the federation is the
autonomous group assembly. It is this body which decides on its own
issues and mandates delegates to reach agreements within the federal
structure, leaving to itself the power to countermand the agreements its
delegates make. In this way autonomy is combined with co-ordination in
an organisation that is structured to accurately reflect the needs and
interests of its members by leaving power in their hands. In the words
of Murray Bookchin, anarchists *"do not deny the need for co-ordination
between groups, for discipline, for meticulous planning, and for unity
in action. But [we] believe that co-ordination, discipline, planning,
and unity in action must be achieved **voluntarily,** by means of
self-discipline nourished by conviction and understanding, not by
coercion and a mindless, unquestioning obedience to orders from above."*
[**Post-Scarcity Anarchism**, p. 215]

Therefore, anarchist support for *"the autonomy of economic
administration"* does not imply the lack of co-operation and
co-ordination, of joint agreements and federal structures which may, to
the uninformed like Morrow, seem to imply the *"abandonment"* of
autonomy. As Kropotkin argued, the commune *"cannot any longer
acknowledge any superior: that, above it, there cannot be anything, save
the interests of the Federation, freely embraced by itself in concert
with other Communes."* [**No Gods, No Masters**, vol. 1, p. 259] This
vision was stressed in the CNT's Saragossa resolution on Libertarian
Communism made in May, 1936, which stated that the *"the foundation of
this administration will be the commune. These communes are to be
autonomous and will be federated at regional and national levels to
achieve their general goals. The right to autonomy does not preclude the
duty to implement agreements regarding collective benefits."* [quoted by
Jose Peirats, **The CNT in the Spanish Revolution**, p. 106] Hence
anarchists do not see making collective decisions and working in a
federation as an abandonment of autonomy or a violation of anarchist
theory.

The reason for this is simple. To exercise your autonomy by joining
self-managing organisations and, therefore, agreeing to abide by the
decisions you help make is not a denial of that autonomy (unlike joining
a hierarchical structure, we must stress). That is why anarchists have
always stressed the importance of the **nature** of the associations
people join **as well as** their voluntary nature -- as Kropotkin
argued, the *"communes of the next revolution will not only break down
the state and substitute free federation for parliamentary rule; they
will part with parliamentary rule within the commune itself . . . They
will be anarchist within the commune as they will be anarchist outside
it."* [**The Commune of Paris**] Moreover, within the federal structures
anarchists envision, the actual day-to-day running of the association
would be autonomous. There would be little or no need for the federation
to interfere with the mundane decisions a group has to make day in, day
out. As the Saragossa resolution makes clear:

> *"[The] commune . . . will undertake to adhere to whatever general
> norms may be agreed by majority vote after free debate . . . The
> inhabitants of a commune are to debate among themselves their internal
> problems . . . Federations are to deliberate over major problems
> affecting a country or province and all communes are to be represented
> at their reunions and assemblies, thereby enabling their delegates to
> convey the democratic viewpoint of their respective communes . . .
> every commune which is implicated will have its right to have its say
> . . . On matters of a regional nature, it is the duty of the regional
> federation to implement agreements . . . So the starting point is the
> individual, moving on through the commune, to the federation and right
> on up finally to the confederation."* [quoted by Jose Peirats, **Op.
> Cit.**, pp. 106-7]

Since the Council of Aragon and the Federation of Collectives were based
on a federal structure, regular meetings of mandated delegates and
decision-making from the bottom up, it would be wrong to call them a
*"centralising agency"* or an *"abandonment"* of the principle of
*"autonomy."* Rather, they were expressions of that autonomy based
around a **federal** and not centralised organisation. The autonomy of
the collective, of its mass assembly, was not restricted by the
federation nor did the federation interfere with the day to day running
of the collectives which made it up. The structure was a federation of
autonomous collectives. The role of the Council was to co-ordinate the
decisions of the federation delegate meetings -- in other words, purely
administrative implementation of collective agreements. To confuse this
with centralisation is a mistake common to Marxists, but it is still a
confusion.

To summarise, what Morrow claims is an *"abandonment"* of anarchism is,
in fact, an expression of anarchist ideas. The Council of Aragon and the
Aragon Federation of Collectives were following the CNT's vision of
libertarian communism and not abandoning it, as Morrow claims. As anyone
with even a basic understanding of anarchism would know.

19. Did the experience of the rural collectives refute anarchism?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Some Leninists attack the rural collectives on similar lines as they
attack the urban ones (as being independent identities and without
co-ordination -- see [section 15](append32.html#app15) for details).
They argue that *"anarchist theory"* resulted in them considering
themselves as being independent bodies and so they ignored wider social
issues and organisation. This meant that anarchist goals could not be
achieved:

> *"Let's evaluate the Spanish collectives according to one of the basic
> goals set by the anarchists themselves. This was to ensure equality
> among the toilers. They believed that the autonomous collectives would
> rapidly equalise conditions among themselves through 'mutual aid' and
> solidarity. This did not happen . . . conditions varied greatly among
> the Spanish collectives, with peasants at some agricultural
> collectives making three times that of peasants at other
> collectives."* [Joseph Green, **Op. Cit.**]

Of course, Green fails to mention that in the presumably "centralised"
system created by the Bolsheviks, the official rationing system had a
differentiation of **eight to one** under the class ration of May 1918.
By 1921, this, apparently, had fallen to around four to one (which is
still higher than the rural collectives) but, in fact, remained at eight
to one due to workers in selected defence-industry factories getting the
naval ration which was approximately double that of the top civilian
workers' ration. [Mary McAuley, **Bread and Justice: State and Society
in Petrograd 1917-1922**, pp. 292-3] This, we note, ignores the various
privileges associated with state office and Communist Party membership
which would increase differentials even more (and such inequality
extended into other fields, Lenin for example warned in 1921 against
*"giving non-Party workers a false sense of having some increase in
their rights"* [Marx, Engels and Lenin, **Op. Cit.**, p. 325]). The
various resolutions made by workers for equality in rations were ignored
by the government (all this long before, to use Green's words *"their
party degenerated into Stalinist revisionism"*).

So, if equality is important, then the decentralised rural collectives
were far more successful in achieving it than the "centralised" system
under Lenin (as to be expected, as the rank-and-file were in control,
not a few at the top).

Needless to the collectives could not unify history instantly. Some
towns and workplaces started off on a more favourable position than
others. Green quotes an academic (David Miller) on this:

> *"Such variations no doubt reflected historical inequalities of
> wealth, but at the same time the redistributive impact of the
> [anarchist] federation had clearly been slight."*

Note that Green implicitly acknowledges that the collectives **did**
form a federation. This makes a mockery of his claims that earlier
claims that the anarchists *"believed that the village communities would
enter the realm of a future liberated society if only they became
autonomous collectives. They didn't see the collectives as only one
step, and they didn't see the need for the collectives to be integrated
into a broader social control of all production."* [**Op. Cit.**] As
proven above, such assertions are either the product of ignorance or a
conscious lie. We quoted numerous Spanish anarchist documents that
stated the exact opposite to Green's assertions. The Spanish anarchists
were well aware of the need for self-managed communities to federate.
Indeed, the federation of collectives fits **exactly** pre-war CNT
policy and anarchist theory (see sections [15](append32.html#app15) and
[18](append32.html#app18) for details). To re-quote a Spanish Anarchist
pamphlet, the village commune *"will federate with its counterparts in
other localities and with the national industrial federations."* [Issac
Puente, **Libertarian Communism**, p. 26] Thus what Green asserts the
CNT and FAI did not see the need of, they in fact **did** see the need
for and argued for their creation before the Civil War and actually
created during it! Green's comments indicate a certain amount of
"doublethink" -- he maintains that the anarchists rejected federations
while acknowledging they did federate.

However, historical differences are the product of **centuries** and so
it will take some time to overcome them, particularly when such changes
are not imposed by a central government. In addition, the collectives
were not allowed to operate freely and were soon being hindered (if not
physically attacked) by the state within a year. Green dismisses this
recognition of reality by arguing *"one could argue that the collectives
didn't have much time to develop, being in existence for only two and a
half years at most, with the anarchists only having one year of
reasonably unhindered work, but one could certainly not argue that this
experience confirmed anarchist theory."* However, his argument is deeply
flawed for many reasons.

Firstly, we have to point out that Green quotes Miller who is using data
from collectives in Castille. Green, however, was apparently discussing
the collectives of Aragon and the Levante and their respective
federations (as was Miller). To state the obvious, it is hard to
evaluate the activities of the Aragon or Levante federation using data
from collectives in the Castille federation. Moreover, in order to
evaluate the redistributive activities of the federations you need to
look at the differentials before and after the federation was created.
The data Miller uses does not do that and so the lack of success of the
federation cannot be evaluated using Green's source. Thus Green uses
data which is, frankly, a joke to dismiss anarchism. This says a lot
about the quality of his critique.

As far as the Castille federation goes, Robert Alexander notes
*"[a]nother feature of the work of regional federation was that of
aiding the less fortunate collectives. Thus, within a year, it spent 2
000 000 pesetas on providing chemical fertilisers and machines to poorer
collectives, the money from this being provided by the sale of products
of the wealthier ones."* [**The Anarchists in the Spanish Civil War**,
vol. 1, p. 438] He also quotes an article from an anarchist paper which
states *"there does not yet exist sufficient solidarity"* between rich
and poor collectives and that notes *"the difficulties which the State
has put in the way of the development of the collectives."* [**Op.
Cit.**, p. 439] Thus the CNT was open about the difficulties it was
experiencing in the collectives and the problems facing it.

Secondly, the collectives may have been in existence for about one year
before the Stalinists attacked but their federations had not. The
Castille federation was born in April, 1937 (the general secretary
stated in July of that year *"[w]e have fought terrible battles with the
Communists"* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 446]). The Aragon federation was created
in February 1937 (the Council of Aragon was created in October 1936) and
the Communists under Lister attacked in August 1937. The Levante
federation was formed a few weeks after the start of the war and the
attacks against them started in March 1937. The longest period of free
development, therefore, was only **seven** months and not a year. Thus
the federations of collectives -- the means seen by anarchist theory to
co-ordinate economic and social activities and promote equality --
existed for only a few months before they were physically attacked by
the state. Green expects miracles if he thinks history can be nullified
in half a year.

Thirdly, anarchists do not think communist-anarchism, in all its many
aspects, is possible overnight. Anarchists are well aware, to quote
Kropotkin, the *"revolution may assume a variety of characters and
differing degrees of intensity among different peoples."* [**No Gods, No
Masters**, vol. 1, p. 231] Also, as noted above, we are well aware that
a revolution is a **process** (*"By revolution we do not mean just the
insurrectionary act"* [Malatesta, **Life and Ideas**, p. 156]) which
will take some time to fully develop once the state has been destroyed
and capital expropriated. Green's assertion that the Spanish Revolution
refutes anarchist theory is clearly a false one.

Green argues that a *"vast organisational task faces the oppressed
masses who are rising up to eliminate the old exploiting system, but
anarchist theory just brushes aside this problem -- co-ordination
between collective would supposedly be easily accomplished by 'mutual
aid' or 'voluntary co-operation' or, if absolutely need be, by the
weakest possible federation."* [**Op. Cit.**] As can be seen from our
discussion, such a claim is a false one. Anarchists are well aware of
difficulties involved in a revolution. That is why we stress that
revolution must come from below, by the actions of the oppressed
themselves -- it is far too complex to left to a few party leaders to
decree the abolition of capitalism. Moreover, as proven above anarchist
theory and practice is well aware of the need for organisation,
co-operation and co-ordination. We obviously do not *"brush it aside."*
This can be seen from Green's reference to *"the weakest possible
federation."* This obviously is a cover just in case the reader is
familiar with anarchist theory and history and knows that anarchists
support the federation of workers' associations and communes as the
organisational framework of a revolution and of the free society.

This distorted vision of anarchism even extents to other aspects of the
revolution. Green decides to attack the relative lack of international
links the Spanish anarchist movement had in 1936. He blames this on
anarchist theory and states *"again the localist anarchist outlook would
go against such preparations. True, the anarchists had had their own
International association in the 1870s, separate from the original First
International and the Marxists. It had flopped so badly that the
anarchists never tried to resuscitate it and seem to prefer to forget
about it. Given anarchist localism, it is not surprising that this
International doesn't even seem to be been missed by current-day
anarchists."* [**Op. Cit.**]

Actually, the anarchist International came out of the First
International and was made up of the libertarian wing of that
association. Moreover, in 1936 the CNT was a member of the International
Workers' Association founded in 1922 in Berlin. The IWA was small, but
this was due to state and Fascist repression. For example, the German
FAUD, the Italian USI and the FORA in Argentina had all been destroyed
by fascist governments. However, those sections which did exist (such as
the Swedish SAC and French CGTSR) **did** send aid to Spain and spread
CNT and FAI news and appeals (as did anarchist groups across the world).
The IWA still exists today, with sections in over a dozen countries
(including the CNT in Spain). In addition, the International Anarchist
Federation also exists, having done so for a number of decades, and also
has sections in numerous countries. In other words, Green either knows
nothing about anarchist history and theory or he does and is lying.

He attacks the lack of CNT support for Moroccan independence during the
war and states *"[t]hey just didn't seem that concerned with the issue
during the Civil War."* Actually, many anarchists **did** raise this
important issue. Just one example, Camillo Berneri argued that *"we must
intensify our propaganda in favour of Morocco autonomy."* [*"What can we
do?"*, **Cienfuegos Press Anarchist Review**, no. 4, p. 51] Thus to
state *"the anarchists . . . didn't seem that concerned"* is simply
false. Many anarchists were and publicly argued for it. Trapped as a
minority force in the government, the CNT could not push through this
position.

Green also points out that inequality existed between men and woman. He
even quotes the anarchist women's organisation Mujeres Libres to prove
his point. He then notes what the Bolsheviks did to combat sexism,
*"[a]mong the methods of influence was mobilising the local population
around social measures promulgated throughout the country. The banner of
the struggle was not autonomy, but class-wide effort."* Two points,
Mujeres Libres was a nation wide organisation which aimed to end sexism
by collective action inside and outside the anarchist movement by
organising women to achieve their own liberation (see Martha
Ackelsberg's , **Free Women of Spain** for more details). Thus its aims
and mode of struggle **was** *"class-wide"* -- as anyone familiar with
that organisation and its activities would know. Secondly, why is
equality between men and women important? Because inequality reduces the
freedom of women to control their own lives, in a word, it hinders they
**autonomy.** Any campaign against sexism is based on the banner of
autonomy -- that Green decides to forget this suggests a lot about his
politics.

Thus Green gets it wrong again and again. Such is the quality of most
Leninist accounts of the Spanish revolution.

20. Does the experience of the Spanish Revolution indicate the failure of anarchism or the failure of anarchists?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Marxists usually point to the events in Catalonia after July 19th, 1936,
as evidence that anarchism is a flawed theory. They bemoan the fact
that, when given the chance, the anarchists did not *"seize power"* and
create a *"dictatorship of the proletariat."* To re-quote Trotsky:

> *"A revolutionary party, even having seized power (of which the
> anarchist leaders were incapable in spite of the heroism of the
> anarchist workers), is still by no means the sovereign ruler of
> society."* [**Stalinism and Bolshevism**]

However, as we argued in [section 12](append32.html#app12), the
Trotskyist "definition" of "workers' power" and "proletarian
dictatorship" is, in fact, party power, party dictatorship and party
sovereignty -- **not** working class self-management. Indeed, in a
letter written in 1937, Trotsky clarified what he meant: *"Because the
leaders of the CNT renounced dictatorship **for themselves** they left
the place open for the Stalinist dictatorship."* [our emphasis,
**Writings 1936-7**, p. 514]

Hence the usual Trotskyist lament concerning the CNT is that the
anarchist leaders did not seize power themselves and create the
so-called *"dictatorship of the proletariat"* (i.e. the dictatorship of
those claiming to represent the proletariat). A strange definition of
*"workers' power,"* we must admit. The "leaders" of the CNT and FAI
quite rightly rejected such a position -- unfortunately they also
rejected the anarchist position at the same time, as we will see.

Trotsky states that the *"leaders of the CNT . . . explained their open
betrayal of the theory of anarchism by the pressure of 'exceptional
circumstances' . . . Naturally, civil war is not a peaceful and ordinary
but an 'exceptional circumstance.' Every serious revolutionary
organisation, however, prepares precisely for 'exceptional
circumstances.'"* [*"Stalinism and Bolshevism"*, **Op. Cit.**, p. 16]

Trotsky is, for once, correct. We will ignore the obvious fact that his
own (and every other Leninist) account of the degeneration of the
Russian Revolution into Stalinism is a variation of the *"exceptional
circumstances"* excuse and turn to his essential point. In order to
evaluate anarchism and the actions of the CNT we have to evaluate
**all** the revolutionary situations it found itself in, **not** just
July, 1936 in Catalonia. This is something Trotsky and his followers
seldom do -- for reasons that will become clear.

Obviously space considerations does not allow us to discuss every
revolutionary situation anarchism faced. We will, therefore, concentrate
on the Russian Revolution and the activities of the CNT in Spain in the
1930s. These examples will indicate that rather than signifying the
failure of anarchism, the actions of the CNT during the Civil War
indicate the failure of anarchists to apply anarchist theory and so
signifies a betrayal of anarchism. In other words, that anarchism is a
valid form of revolutionary politics.

If we look at the Russian Revolution, we see anarchist theory gain its
most wide scale influence in those parts of the Ukraine protected by the
Makhnovist army. The Makhnovists fought against White (pro-Tsarist), Red
and Ukrainian Nationalists in favour of a system of *"free soviets"* in
which the *"working people themselves must freely choose their own
soviets, which are to carry out the will and desires of the working
people themselves. that is to say, **administrative**, not ruling
councils."* As for the economy, the *"land, the factories, the
workshops, the mines, the railroads and the other wealth of the people
must belong to the working people themselves, to those who work in them,
that is to say, they must be socialised."* [*"Some Makhnovist
Proclamations"*, contained in Peter Arshinov, **The History of the
Makhnovist Movement**, p. 273]

To ensure this end, the Makhnovists refused to set up governments in the
towns and cities they liberated, instead urging the creation of free
soviets so that the working people could govern themselves. Taking the
example of Aleksandrovsk, once they had liberated the city the
Makhnovists *"immediately invited the working population to participate
in a general conference . . . it was proposed that the workers organise
the life of the city and the functioning of the factories with their own
forces and their own organisations . . . The first conference was
followed by a second. The problems of organising life according to
principles of self-management by workers were examined and discussed
with animation by the masses of workers, who all welcomed this ideas
with the greatest enthusiasm . . . Railroad workers took the first step
. . . They formed a committee charged with organising the railway
network of the region . . . From this point, the proletariat of
Aleksandrovsk began systematically to the problem of creating organs of
self-management."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 149]

They also organised free agricultural communes which *"[a]dmittedly . .
. were not numerous, and included only a minority of the population . .
. But what was most precious was that these communes were formed by the
poor peasants themselves. The Makhnovists never exerted any pressure on
the peasants, confining themselves to propagating the idea of free
communes."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 87] Makhno played an important role in
abolishing the holdings of the landed gentry. The local soviet and their
district and regional congresses equalised the use of the land between
all sections of the peasant community. [**Op. Cit.**, pp. 53-4]

Moreover, the Makhnovists took the time and energy to involve the whole
population in discussing the development of the revolution, the
activities of the army and social policy. They organised numerous
conferences of workers', soldiers' and peasants' delegates to discuss
political and social issues. They organised a regional congress of
peasants and workers when they had liberated Aleksandrovsk. When the
Makhnovists tried to convene the third regional congress of peasants,
workers and insurgents in April 1919 and an extraordinary congress of
several regions in June 1919 (including Red Army soldiers) the
Bolsheviks viewed them as counter-revolutionary, tried to ban them and
declared their organisers and delegates outside the law. For example,
Trotsky issued order 1824 which stated the June 1919 congress was
forbidden, that to inform the population of it was an act of high
treason and all delegates should be arrested immediately as were all the
spreading the call. [**Op. Cit.**, p. 98-105 and p. 122-31]

The Makhnovists replied by holding the conferences anyway and asking
*"[c]an there exist laws made by a few people who call themselves
revolutionaries, which permit them to outlaw a whole people who are more
revolutionary than they are themselves?"* and *"[w]hose interests should
the revolution defend: those of the Party or those of the people who set
the revolution in motion with their blood?"* Makhno himself stated that
he *"consider[ed] it an inviolable right of the workers and peasants, a
right won by the revolution, to call conferences on their own account,
to discuss their affairs."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 103 and p. 129] These
actions by the Bolsheviks should make the reader ponder if the
elimination of workers' democracy during the civil war can fully be
explained by the objective conditions facing Lenin's government or
whether Leninist ideology played an important role in it. As Arshinov
argues, *"[w]hoever studies the Russian Revolution should learn it
[Trotsky's order no. 1824] by heart."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 123] Obviously
the Bolsheviks considered that soviet system was threatened if soviet
conferences were called and the "dictatorship of the proletariat" was
undermined if the proletariat took part in such events.

In addition, the Makhnovists *"full applied the revolutionary principles
of freedom of speech, of thought, of the press, and of political
association. In all cities and towns occupied by the Makhnovists, they
began by lifting all the prohibitions and repealing all the restrictions
imposed on the press and on political organisations by one or another
power."* Indeed, the *"only restriction that the Makhnovists considered
necessary to impose on the Bolsheviks, the left
Socialist-Revolutionaries and other statists was a prohibition on the
formation of those 'revolutionary committees' which sought to impose a
dictatorship over the people."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 153 and p. 154]

The army itself, in stark contrast to the Red Army, was fundamentally
democratic (although, of course, the horrific nature of the civil war
did result in a few deviations from the ideal -- however, compared to
the regime imposed on the Red Army by Trotsky, the Makhnovists were much
more democratic movement). Arshinov proves a good summary:

> *"The Makhnovist insurrectionary army was organised according to three
> fundamental principles: voluntary enlistment, the electoral principle,
> and self-discipline.*
>
> "**Voluntary enlistment** meant that the army was composed only of
> revolutionary fighters who entered it of their own free will.
>
> "**The electoral principle** meant that the commanders of all units of
> the army, including the staff, as well as all the men who held other
> positions in the army, were either elected or accepted by the
> insurgents of the unit in question or by the whole army.
>
> "**Self-discipline** meant that all the rules of discipline were drawn
> up by commissions of insurgents, then approved by general assemblies
> of the various units; once approved, they were rigorously observed on
> the individual responsibility of each insurgent and each commander."
> [**Op. Cit.**, p. 96]

Thus the Makhnovists indicate the validity of anarchist theory. They
organised the self-defence of their region, refused to form of a
"revolutionary" government and so the life of the region, its social and
revolutionary development followed the path of self-activity of the
working people who did not allow any authorities to tell them what to
do. They respected freedom of association, speech, press and so on while
actively encouraging workers' and peasants' self-management and
self-organisation.

Moving to the Spanish movement, the various revolts and uprisings
organised by the CNT and FAI that occurred before 1936 were marked by a
similar revolutionary developments as the Makhnovists. We discuss the
actual events of the revolts in 1932 and 1933 in more detail in [section
14](append32.html#app14) and so will not repeat ourselves here. However,
all were marked by the anarchist movement attacking town halls, army
barracks and other sources of state authority and urging the troops to
revolt and side with the masses (the anarchists paid a lot of attention
to this issue -- like the French syndicalists they produced
anti-militarist propaganda arguing that soldiers should side with their
class and refuse orders to fire on strikers and to join popular
revolts). The revolts also saw workers taking over their workplaces and
the land, trying to abolish capitalism while trying to abolish the
state. In summary, they were **insurrections** which combined political
goals (the abolition of the state) and social ones (expropriation of
capital and the creation of self-managed workplaces and communes).

The events in Asturias in October 1934 gives a more detailed account of
nature of these insurrections. The anarchist role in this revolt has not
been as widely known as it should be and this is an ideal opportunity to
discuss it. Combined with the other insurrections of the 1930s it
clearly indicates that anarchism is a valid form of revolutionary
theory.

While the CNT was the minority union in Asturias, it had a considerable
influence of its own (the CNT had over 22 000 affiliates in the area and
the UGT had 40 000). The CNT had some miners in their union (the
majority were in the UGT) but most of their membership was above ground,
particularly in the towns of Aviles and Gijon. The regional federation
of the CNT had joined the Socialist Party dominated "Alianza Obrera,"
unlike the other regional federations of the CNT.

When the revolt started, the workers organised attacks on barracks, town
halls and other sources of state authority (just as the CNT revolts of
1932 and 1933 had). Bookchin indicates that *"[s]tructurely, the
insurrection was managed by hundreds of small revolutionary committees
whose delegates were drawn from unions, parties, the FAI and even
anti-Stalinist Communist groups. Rarely, if at all, were there large
councils (or 'soviets') composed of delegates from factories."* [**The
Spanish Anarchists**, p. 249] This, incidentally, indicates that
Morrow's claims that in Asturias *"the Workers' Alliances were most
nearly like soviets, and had been functioning for a year under socialist
and Communist Left leadership"* are false. [**Op. Cit.**, p. 31] The
claims that the Asturias uprising had established soviets was simply
Communist and government propaganda.

In fact, the Socialists *"generally functioned through tightly knit
committees, commonly highly centralised and with strong bureaucratic
proclivities. In Asturias, the UGT tried to perpetuate this form
wherever possible . . . But the mountainous terrain of Asturias made
such committees difficult to co-ordinate, so that each one became an
isolated miniature central committee of its own, often retaining its
traditional authoritarian character."* The anarchists, on the other
hand, *"favoured looser structures, often quasi-councils composed of
factory workers and assemblies composed of peasants. The ambience of
these fairly decentralised structures, their improvisatory character and
libertarian spirit, fostered an almost festive atmosphere in
Anarchist-held areas."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 249] Bookchin quotes an
account which compares anarchist La Felguera with Marxist Sama, towns of
equal size and separated only by the Nalon river:

> *"[The October Insurrection] triumphed immediately in the
> metallurgical and in the mining town. . . . Sama was organised along
> military lines. Dictatorship of the proletariat, red army, Central
> Committee, discipline. authority . . . La Felguera opted for
> **communismo libertario**: the people in arms, liberty to come and go,
> respect for the technicians of the Duro-Felguera metallurgical plant,
> public deliberations of all issues, abolition of money, the rational
> distribution of food and clothing. Enthusiasm and gaiety in La
> Felguera; the sullenness of the barracks in Sama. The bridges [of
> Sama] were held by a corp of guards complete with officers and all. No
> one could enter or leave Sama without a safe-conduct pass, or walk
> through the streets without passwords. All of this was ridiculously
> useless, because the government troops were far away and the Sama
> bourgeoisie disarmed and neutralised . . . The workers of Sama who did
> not adhere to the Marxist religion preferred to go to La Felguera,
> where at least they could breathe. Side by side there were two
> concepts of socialism: the authoritarian and the libertarian; on each
> bank of the Nalon, two populations of brothers began a new life: with
> dictatorship in Sama; with liberty in La Felguera."* [**Op. Cit.**,
> pp. 249-50]

Bookchin notes that *"[i]n contrast to the severely delimited Marxist
committee in Sama, La Felguera workers met in popular assembly, where
they socialised the industrial city's economy. The population was
divided into wards, each of which elected delegates to supply and
distribution committees. . . The La Felguera commune . . . proved to be
so successful, indeed so admirable, that surrounding communities invited
the La Felguera Anarchists to advice them on reorganising their own
social order. Rarely were comparable institutions created by the
Socialists and, where they did emerge, it was on the insistence of the
rank-and-file workers."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 250]

In other words, the Asturias uprising saw anarchists yet again applying
their ideas with great success in a revolutionary situation. As Bookchin
argues:

> *"Almost alone, the Anarchists were to create viable revolutionary
> institutions structured around workers' control of industry and
> peasants' control of land. That these institutions were to be
> duplicated by Socialist workers and peasants was due in small measure
> to Anarchist example rather than Socialist precept. To the degree that
> the Asturian miners and industrial workers in various communities
> established direct control over the local economy and structured their
> committees along libertarian lines, these achievements were due to
> Anarchist precedents and long years of propaganda and education."*
> [**Op. Cit.**, p. 250-1]

Unlike their Socialist and Communist allies, the anarchists in Asturias
took the Alianza's slogan *"Unity, Proletarian Brothers"* seriously. A
key factor in the defeat of the uprising (beyond its isolation due to
socialist incompetence elsewhere -- see [section 6](append32.html#app6))
was the fact that *"[s]o far as the Aviles and Gijon Anarchists were
concerned . . . their Socialist and Communist 'brothers' were to honour
the slogan only in the breach. When Anarchist delegates from the
seaports arrived in Oviedo on October 7, pleading for arms to resist the
imminent landings of government troops, their requests were totally
ignored by Socialists and Communists who, as [historian Gabriel] Jackson
notes, 'clearly mistrusted them.' The Oviedo Committee was to pay a
bitter price for its refusal. The next day, when Anarchist resistance,
hampered by the pitiful supply of weapons, failed to prevent the
government from landing its troops, the way into Asturias lay open. The
two seaports became the principal military bases for launching the
savage repression of the Asturian insurrection that occupied so much of
October and claimed thousands of lives."* [Murray Bookchin, **Op.
Cit.**, p. 248]

Therefore, to state as Morrow does that before July 1936, *"anarchism
had never been tested on a grand scale"* and now *"leading great masses,
it was to have a definite test"* is simply wrong. [**Op. Cit.**, p. 101]
Anarchism had had numerous definite tests before involving *"great
masses,"* both in Spain and elsewhere. The revolts of the 1930s, the
Makhnovists in the Ukraine, the factory occupations in Italy in 1920
(see [section A.5.5](secA5.html#seca55)) and in numerous other
revolutionary and near revolutionary situations anarchism had been
tested **and had passed** those tests. Defeat came about by the actions
of the Marxists (in the case of Asturias and Italy) or by superior force
(as in the 1932 and 1933 Spanish insurrections and the Ukraine) **not**
because of anarchist theory or activities. At no time did they
collaborate with the bourgeois state or compromise their politics. By
concentrating on July 1936, Marxists effectively distort the history of
anarchism -- a bit like arguing the actions of the Social Democratic
Party in crushing the German discredits Marxism while ignoring the
actions and politics of the council communists during it or the Russian
Revolution.

But the question remains, why did the CNT and FAI make such a mess
(politically at least) of the Spanish Revolution of 1936? However, even
this question is unfair as the example of the Aragon Defence Council and
Federation of Collectives indicate that anarchists **did** apply their
ideas successfully in certain areas during that revolution.

Morrow is aware of that example, as he argues that the *"Catalonian
[i.e. CNT] militia marched into Aragon as an army of social liberation .
. . Arriving in a village, the militia committees sponsor the election
of a village anti-fascist committee . . . [which] organises production
on a new basis"* and *"[e]very village wrested from the fascists was
transformed into a forest of revolution."* Its *"municipal councils were
elected directly by the communities. The Council of Aragon was at first
largely anarchist."* He notes that *"[l]ibertarian principles were
attempted in the field of money and wages"* yet he fails to mention the
obvious application of libertarian principles in the field of
**politics** with the state abolished and replaced by a federation of
workers' associations. To do so would be to invalidate his basic thesis
against anarchism and so it goes unmentioned, hoping the reader will not
notice this confirmation of anarchist **politics** in practice. [**Op.
Cit.**, p. 53, p. 204 and p. 205]

So, from the experience of the Ukraine, the previous revolts in 1932,
1933 and 1934 and the example of the Council of Aragon it appears clear
that rather than exposing anarchist theory (as Marxists claim), the
example of July 1936 in Catalonia is an aberration. Anarchist politics
had been confirmed as a valid revolutionary theory many times before
and, indeed, shown themselves as the only one to ensure a free society.
However, why did this aberration occur?

Most opponents of anarchism provide a rather (in)famous quote from FAI
militant Juan Garcia Oliver, describing the crucial decision made in
Catalonia in July of '36 to co-operate with Companys' government to
explain the failure of the CNT to "seize power":

> *"The CNT and FAI decided on collaboration and democracy, eschewing
> revolutionary totalitarianism . . . by the anarchist and Confederal
> dictatorship."* [quoted by Stuart Christie, **We, the Anarchists!**,
> p. 105]

In this statement Garcia Oliver describes the capitalist state as
"democracy" and refers to the alternative of the directly democratic CNT
unions taking power as "totalitarianism" and "dictatorship." Marxists
tend to think this statement tells us something about the CNT's original
program in the period leading up to the crisis of July 1936. As proven
above, any such assertion would be false (see also [section
8](append32.html#app8)). In fact this statement was made in December of
1937, many months after Garcia Oliver and other influential CNT
activists had embarked upon collaboration in the government ministries
and Republican army command. The quote is taken from a report by the CNT
leadership, presented by Garcia Oliver and Mariano Vazquez (CNT National
Secretary in 1937) at the congress of the International Workers
Association (IWA). The CNT was aware that government participation was
in violation of the principles of the IWA and the report was intended to
provide a rationalisation. That report is an indication of just how far
Garcia Oliver and other influential CNT radicals had been corrupted by
the experience of government collaboration.

Garcia Oliver's position in July of 1936 had been entirely different. He
had been one of the militants to argue in favour of overthrowing the
Companys government in Catalonia in the crucial union assemblies of July
20-21. As Juan Gomez Casas argues:

> *"The position supported by Juan Garcia Oliver [in July of '36] has
> been described as \`anarchist dictatorship' Actually, though, Oliver
> was advocating application of the goals of the Saragossa Congress in
> Barcelona and Catalonia at a time in history when, in his opinion,
> libertarian communism was a real possibility. It would always signify
> dissolution of the old parties dedicated to the idea of [state] power,
> or at least make it impossible for them to pursue their politics aimed
> at seizure of power. There will always be pockets of opposition to new
> experiences and therefore resistance to joining 'the spontaneity of
> the popular masses.' In addition, the masses would have complete
> freedom of expression in the unions and in the economic organisations
> of the revolution as well as in their political organisations."*
> [**Anarchist Organisation: The History of the FAI**, p. 188f]

Those libertarians who defended government participation in Spain argued
that a non-hierarchical re-organisation of society in Catalonia in July
of '36 could only have been imposed by force, against the opposition of
the parties and sectors of society that have a vested interest in
existing inequalities. They argued that this would have been a
"dictatorship," no better than the alternative of government
collaboration.

If this argument were valid, then it logically means that anarchism
itself would be impossible, for there will always be sectors of society
-- bosses, judges, politicians, etc. -- who will oppose social
re-organisation on a libertarian basis. As Malatesta once argued, some
people *"seem almost to believe that after having brought down
government and private property we would allow both to be quietly built
up again, because of a respect for the **freedom** of those who might
feel the need to be rulers and property owners. A truly curious way of
interpreting our ideas!"* [**Anarchy**, p. 41] It is doubtful he would
have predicted that certain anarchists would be included in such
believers!

Neither anarchism nor the CNT program called for suppressing other
viewpoints. The various viewpoints that existed among the workforce and
population would be reflected in the deliberations and debates of the
workplace and community assemblies as well as in the various local and
regional congresses and conference and on their co-ordinating Councils.
The various political groups would be free to organise, publish their
periodicals and seek influence in the various self-managed assemblies
and structures that existed. The CNT would be dominant because it had
overwhelming support among the workers of Catalonia (and would have
remained dominant as long as that continued).

What is essential to a state is that its authority and armed power be
top-down, separate and distinct from the population. Otherwise it could
not function to protect the power of a boss class. When a population in
society directly and democratically controls the armed force (in fact,
effectively **is** the armed force as in the case of the CNT militias),
directly manages its own fairs in decentralised, federal organisations
based on self-management from the bottom upwards and manages the
economy, this is not a "state" in the historical sense. Thus the CNT
would not in any real sense had "seized power" in Catalonia, rather it
would have allowed the mass of people, previously disempowered by the
state, to take control of their own lives -- both individually and
collectively -- by smashing the state and replacing it by a free
federation of workers' associations.

What this means is that a non-hierarchical society must be imposed by
the working class against the opposition of those who would lose power.
In building the new world we must destroy the old one. Revolutions are
authoritarian by their very nature, but only in respect to structures
and social relations which promote injustice, hierarchy and inequality.
It is not "authoritarian" to destroy authority, in other words!
Revolutions, above all else, must be libertarian in respect to the
oppressed (indeed, they are acts of liberation in which the oppressed
end their oppression by their own direct action). That is, they must
develop structures that involve the great majority of the population,
who have previously been excluded from decision making about social and
economic issues.

So the dilemma of "anarchist dictatorship" or "collaboration" was a
false one and fundamentally wrong. It was never a case of banning
parties, etc. under an anarchist system, far from it. Full rights of
free speech, organisation and so on should have existed for all but the
parties would only have as much influence as they exerted in union,
workplace, community, militia (and so on) assemblies, as should be the
case! "Collaboration" yes, but within the rank and file and within
organisations organised in a libertarian manner. Anarchism does not
respect the "freedom" to be a capitalist, boss or politician.

Instead of this "collaboration" from the bottom up, the CNT and FAI
committees favoured "collaboration" from the top down. In this they
followed the example of the UGT and its "Workers' Alliances" rather than
their own activities previous to the military revolt. Why? Why did the
CNT and FAI in Catalonia reject their previous political perspective and
reject the basis ideas of anarchism? As shown above, the CNT and FAI has
successfully applied their ideas in many insurrections before hand. Why
the change of direction? There were two main reasons.

Firstly, while a majority in Catalonia and certain other parts of Spain,
the CNT and FAI were a minority in such areas as Castille and Asturias.
To combat fascism required the combined forces of all parties and unions
and by collaborating with a UGT-like "Anti-Fascist Alliance" in
Catalonia, it was believed that such alliances could be formed
elsewhere, with equality for the CNT ensured by the Catalan CNT's
decision of equal representation for minority organisations in the
Catalan Anti-Fascist Committee. This would, hopefully, also ensure aid
to CNT militias via the government's vast gold reserves and stop foreign
intervention by Britain and other countries to protect their interests
if libertarian communism was declared.

However, as Vernon Richards argues:

> Revolution**, p. 42]

In addition, in failing to take the initiative to unite the working
class independently of the Republican state at the crucial moment, in
July of '36, the CNT of Catalonia was in effect abandoning the only
feasible alternative to the Popular Front strategy. Without a
libertarian system of popular self-management, the CNT and FAI had no
alternative but to join the bourgeois state. For a revolution to be
successful, as Bakunin and Kropotkin argued, it needs to create
libertarian organisations (such as workers' associations, free communes
and their federations) which can effectively replace the state and the
market, that is to create a widespread libertarian organisation for
social and economic decision making through which working class people
can start to set their own agendas. Only by going this can the state and
capitalism be effectively smashed. If this is not done and the state is
ignored rather than smashed, it continue and get stronger as it will be
the only medium that exists for wide scale decision making. This will
result in revolutionaries having to work within it, trying to influence
it since no other means exist to reach collective decisions.

The failure to smash the state, this first betrayal of anarchist
principles, led to all the rest, and so the defeat of the revolution.
Not destroying the state meant that the revolution could never be fully
successful economically as politics and economics are bound together so
closely. Only under the political conditions of anarchism can its
economic conditions flourish and vice versa.

The CNT had never considered a "strategy" of collaboration with the
Popular Front prior to July of '36. In the months leading up to the July
explosion, the CNT had consistently criticised the Popular Front
strategy as a fake unity of leaders over the workers, a strategy that
would subordinate the working class to capitalist legality. However, in
July of '36, the CNT conferences in Catalonia had not seen clearly that
their "temporary" participation in the Anti-Fascist Militia Committee
would drag them inexorably into a practice of collaboration with the
Popular Front. As Christie argues, *"the Militias Committee was a
compromise, an artificial political solution . . . It . . . drew the
CNT-FAI leadership inexorably into the State apparatus, until them its
principle enemy, and led to the steady erosion of anarchist influence
and credibility."* [**Op. Cit.**, p. 105]

Secondly, the fear of fascism played a key role. After all, this was
1936. The CNT and FAI had seen their comrades in Italy and Germany being
crushed by fascist dictatorships, sent to concentration camps and so on.
In Spain, Franco's forces were slaughtering union and political
militants and members by the tens of thousands (soon to reach hundreds
of thousands by the end of the war and beyond). The insurrection had not
been initiated by the people themselves (as had the previous revolts in
the 1930s) and this also had a psychological impact on the decision
making process. The anarchists were, therefore, in a position of being
caught between two evils -- fascism and the bourgeois state, elements of
which had fought with them on the streets. To pursue anarchist politics
at such a time, it was argued, could have resulted in the CNT fighting
on two fronts -- against the fascists and also against the Republican
government. Such a situation would have been unbearable and so it was
better to accept collaboration than aid Fascism by dividing the forces
of the anti-fascist camp.

However, such a perspective failed to appreciate the depth of hatred the
politicians and bourgeois had for the CNT. Indeed, by their actions it
would appear they preferred fascism to the social revolution. So, in the
name of "anti-fascist" unity, the CNT worked with parties and classes
which hated both them and the revolution. In the words of Sam Dolgoff
*"both before and after July 19th, an unwavering determination to crush
the revolutionary movement was the leitmotif behind the policies of the
Republican government; irrespective of the party in power."* [**The
Anarchist Collectives**, p. 40]

Rather than eliminate a civil war developing within the civil war, the
policy of the CNT just postponed it -- until such time as the state was
stronger than the working class. The Republican government was quite
happy to attack the gains of the revolution, physically attacking rural
and urban collectives, union halls, assassinating CNT and FAI members of
so on. The difference was the CNT's act only postponed such conflict
until the balance of power had shifted back towards the status quo.

Moreover, the fact that the bourgeois republic was fighting fascism
could have meant that it would have tolerated the CNT social revolution
rather than fight it (and so weakening its own fight against Franco).
However, such an argument remains moot.

It is clear that anti-fascism destroyed the revolution, not fascism. As
a Scottish anarchist in Barcelona during the revolution argued,
*"Fascism is not something new, some new force of evil opposed to
society, but is only the old enemy, Capitalism, under a new and fearful
sounding name . . . Anti-Fascism is the new slogan by which the working
class is being betrayed."* [Ethal McDonald, **Workers Free Press**, Oct.
1937] This was also argued by the **Friends of Durruti** who stated that
*"[d]emocracy defeated the Spanish people, not Fascism."* [**The Friends
of Durruti Accuse**]

The majority at the July 20-21 conferences went along with proposal of
postponing the social revolution, of starting the work of creating
libertarian communism, and smashing the state and replacing it with a
federation of workers' assemblies. Most of the CNT militants there saw
it as a temporary expedient, until the rest of Spain was freed from
Franco's forces (in particular, Aragon and Saragossa). Companys' (the
head of the Catalan government) had proposed the creation of a body
containing representatives of all anti-fascist parties and unions called
the *"Central Committee of Anti-Fascist Militias,"* sponsored by his
government. The CNT meeting agreed to this proposal, though only on
condition that the CNT be given the majority on it. A sizeable minority
of delegates were apparently disgusted by this decision. The delegation
from Bajo Llobregat County (an industrial area south of Barcelona)
walked out saying they would never go along with government
collaboration.

Therefore, the decision to postpone the revolution and so to ignore the
state rather than smashing was a product of isolation and the fear of a
fascist victory. However, while "isolation" may explain the Catalan
militants' fears and so decisions, it does not justify their decision.
If the CNT of Catalonia had given Companys the boot and set up a
federation of workplace and community assemblies in Catalonia, uniting
the rank-and-file of the other unions with the CNT, this would have
strengthened the resolve of workers in other parts of Spain, and it
might have also inspired workers in nearby countries to move in a
similar direction.

Isolation, the uneven support for a libertarian revolution across Spain
and the dangers of fascism were real problems, but they do not excuse
the libertarian movement for its mistakes. On the contrary, in following
the course of action advised by leaders like Horacio Prieto and Abad
Diego de Santillan, the CNT only weakened the revolution and helped to
discredit libertarian socialism. After all, as Bakunin and Kropotkin
continually stressed, revolutions break out in specific areas and then
spread outward -- isolation is a feature of revolution which can only be
overcome by action, by showing a practical example which others can
follow.

Most of the CNT militants at the July 20th meeting saw the compromise as
a temporary expedient, until the rest of Spain was freed from Franco's
forces (in particular, Aragon and Saragossa). As the official account
states, *"[t]he situation was considered and it was unanimously decided
not to mention Libertarian Communism until such time as we had captured
that part of Spain that was in the hands of the rebels."* [quoted by
Christie, **Op. Cit.**, p. 102] However, the membership of the CNT
decided **themselves** to start the social revolution (*"very rapidly
collectives . . . began to spring up. It did not happen on instructions
from the CNT leadership . . . the initiative came from CNT militants"*
[Ronald Fraser, **Blood of Spain**, p. 349]). The social revolution
began anyway, from below, but without the key political aspect
(abolition of the state) and so was fatally compromised from the
beginning.

As Stuart Christie argues:

In other words, the bulk of the CNT-FAI membership acted in an anarchist
way while the higher committees compromised their politics and
achievements in the name of anti-fascist unity. In this the membership
followed years of anarchist practice and theory. It was fear of fascism
which made many of the leading militants of the CNT abandon anarchist
politics and instead embrace "anti-fascist unity" and compromise with
the bourgeois republic. To claim that July 1936 indicated the failure of
anarchism means to ignore the constructive work of millions of CNT
members in their workplaces, communities and militias and instead
concentrate on a few militants who made the terrible mistake of ignoring
their political ideas in an extremely difficult situation. As we said
above, this may explain the decision but it does not justify it.

Therefore, it is clear that the experiences of the CNT and FAI in 1936
indicate a failure of anarchists to apply their politics rather than the
failure of those politics. The examples of the Makhnovists, the revolts
in Spain between 1932 and 1934 as well as the Council of Aragon show
beyond doubt that this is the case. Rather than act as anarchists in
July 1936, the militants of the Catalan CNT and FAI ignored their basic
ideas (not lightly, we stress, but in response to real dangers). They
later justified their decisions by putting their options in a Marxist
light -- "either we impose libertarian communism, and so become an
anarchist dictatorship, or we collaborate with the democratic
government." As Vernon Richards makes clear:

> *"Such alternatives are contrary to the most elementary principles of
> anarchism and revolutionary syndicalism. In the first place, an

> encourage the development of the social revolution and to frustrate
> any attempts by the bourgeois capitalist state to reorganise itself,
> which it would seek to do."* [**Op. Cit.**, pp. 43-6]

Their compromise in the name of anti-fascist unity contained the rest of
their mistakes. Joining the "Central Committee of Anti-Fascist Militias"
was the second mistake as at no time could it be considered as the
embryo of a new workers' power. It was, rather, an organisation like the
pre-war UGT "Workers' Alliances" -- an attempt to create links between
the top-level of other unions and parties. Such an organisation, as the
CNT recognised before the war (see [section 5](append32.html#app5)),
could not be a means of creating a revolutionary federation of workers'
associations and communes and, in fact, a hindrance to such a
development, if not its chief impediment.

Given that the CNT had rejected the call for revolution in favour of
anti-fascist unit on July 20th, such a development does not reflect the
CNT's pre-war program. Rather it was a reversion to Felix Morrow's
Trotskyist position of joining the UGT's "Workers' Alliance" in spite of
its non-revolutionary nature (see [section 5](append32.html#app5)).

The CNT did not carry out its program (and so apply anarchist politics)
and so did not replace the Generalitat (Catalan State) with a Defence
Council in which only union/workplace assemblies (not political parties)
were represented. To start the process of creating libertarian communism
all the CNT would have had do was to call a Regional Congress of unions
and invite the UGT, independent unions and unorganised workplaces to
send delegates. It could also have invited the various neighbourhood and
village defence committees that had either sprung up spontaneously or
were already organised before the war as part of the CNT. Unlike the
other revolts it took part in the 1930s, the CNT did not apply anarchist
politics. However, to judge anarchism by this single failure means to
ignore the whole history of anarchism and its successful applications
elsewhere, including by the CNT and FAI during numerous revolts in Spain
during the 1930s and in Aragon in 1936.

Ironically enough, Kropotkin had attacked the official CNT line of not
mentioning Libertarian Communism *"until such time as we had captured
that part of Spain that was in the hands of the rebels."* In analysing
the Paris Commune Kropotkin had lambasted those who had argued *"Let us
first make sure of victory, and then see what can be done."* His
comments are worth quoting at length:

> *"Make sure of victory! As if there were any way of forming a free
> commune without laying hands upon property! As if there were any way
> of conquering the foe while the great mass of the people is not
> directly interested in the triumph of the revolution, by seeing that
> it will bring material, moral and intellectual well-being to
> everybody.*
>
> "The same thing happened with regard to the principle of government.
> By proclaiming the free Commune, the people of Paris proclaimed an
> essential anarchist principle, which was the breakdown of the state.
>
> "And yet, if we admit that a central government to regulate the
> relations of communes between themselves is quite needless, why should
> we admit its necessity to regulate the mutual relations of the groups
> which make up each commune? . . . There is no more reason for a
> government inside the commune than for a government outside." [**The
> Commune of Paris**]

Kropotkin's argument was sound, as the CNT discovered. By waiting until
victory in the war they were defeated. Kropotkin also indicated the
inevitable effects of the CNT's actions in co-operating with the state
and joining representative bodies. In his words:

> *"Paris sent her devoted sons to the town hall. There, shelved in the
> midst of files of old papers, obliged to rule when their instincts
> prompted them to be and to act among the people, obliged to discuss
> when it was needful to act, to compromise when no compromise was the
> best policy, and, finally, losing the inspiration which only comes
> from continual contact with the masses, they saw themselves reduced to
> impotence. Being paralysed by their separation from the people -- the
> revolutionary centre of light and heat -- they themselves paralysed
> the popular initiative."* [**Op. Cit.**]

Which, in a nutshell, was what happened to the leading militants of the
CNT who collaborated with the state. As anarchist turned Minister
admitted after the war, *"[w]e were in the government, but the streets
were slipping away from us. We had lost the workers' trust and the
movement's unity had been whittled away."* [**No Gods, No Masters**,
vol. 2, p. 274] The actions of the CNT-FAI higher committees and
Ministers helped paralyse and defeat the May Days revolt of 1937. The
CNT committees and leaders become increasingly isolated from the people,
they compromised again and again and, ultimately, became an impotent
force. Kropotkin was proved correct. Which means that far from refuting
anarchist politics or analysis, the experience of the CNT-FAI in the
Spanish Revolution ***confirms** it.*

In summary, therefore, the Spanish Revolution of 1936 indicates the
failure of anarchists rather than the failure of anarchism.

One last point, it could be argued that anarchist theory allowed the
leadership of the CNT and FAI to paint their collaboration with the
state as a libertarian policy. That is, of course, correct. Anarchism is
against the so-called "dictatorship of the proletariat" just as much as
it is against the actual dictatorship of the bourgeoisie (i.e. the
existing system and its off-shoots such as fascism). This allowed the
CNT and FAI leaders to argue that they were following anarchist theory
by not destroying the state completely in July 1936. Of course, such a
position cannot be used to discredit anarchism simply because such a
revision meant that it can never be libertarian to abolish government
and the state. In other words, the use made of anarchist theory by the
leaders of the CNT and FAI in this case presents nothing else than a
betrayal of that theory rather than its legitimate use.

Also, and more importantly, while anarchist theory was corrupted to
justify working with other parties and unions in a democratic state,
**Marxist** theory was used to justify the brutal one-party dictatorship
of the Bolsheviks, first under Lenin and the Stalin. That, we feel, sums
up the difference between anarchism and Leninism quite well.
