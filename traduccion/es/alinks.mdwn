Anarchist Newsgroups
--------------------

***News-groups which are explicitly anarchist.***

Like the rest of the usenet, the newsgroups for anarchism is filled with
junk mail, pro-capitalist libertarians (some of them claiming to be
anarchists), off the subject comments and personal attacks. But what
else can you expect from a completely uncensored news-channel? You also
find interesting debates and announcements about events, and newsgroups
have one advantage over mailing-lists: You only read the posts you pick
out yourselves, while the contents of mailing lists keep dumping down in
your mailbox.
