Welcome to our FAQ on anarchism
-------------------------------

This FAQ was written by anarchists across the world in an attempt to
present anarchist ideas and theory to those interested in it. It is a
co-operative effort, produced by a (virtual) working group and it exists
to present a useful organising tool for anarchists on-line and,
hopefully, in the real world. It desires to present arguments on why you
should be an anarchist as well as refuting common arguments against
anarchism and other proposed solutions to the social problems we face.

As anarchist ideas seem so at odds with "common-sense" (such as "of
course we need a state and capitalism") we need to indicate **why**
anarchists think like we do. Unlike many political theories, anarchism
rejects flip answers and instead bases its ideas and ideals in an
in-depth analysis of society and humanity. In order to do both anarchism
and the reader justice we have summarised our arguments as much as
possible without making them simplistic. We know that it is a lengthy
document and may put off the casual observer but its length is
unavoidable.

Readers may consider our use of extensive quoting as being an example of
a *"quotation [being] a handy thing to have about, saving one the
trouble of thinking for oneself."* (A.A. Milne) This is not the case of
course. We have included extensive quotations by many anarchist figures
for three reasons. Firstly, to indicate that we are **not** making up
our claims of what certain anarchists thought or argued for. Secondly,
and most importantly, it allows us to link the past voices of anarchism
with its present adherents. And lastly, the quotes are used for their
ability to convey ideas succinctly rather than as an appeal to
"authority."

In addition, many quotes are used in order to allow readers to
investigate the ideas of those quoted and to summarise facts and so save
space. For example, a quote by Noam Chomsky on the development of
capitalism by state protection ensures that we base our arguments on
facts without having to present all the evidence and references Chomsky
uses. Similarly, we quote experts on certain subjects (such as
economics, for example) to support and bolster our analysis and claims.

We should also indicate the history of this FAQ. It was started in 1995
when a group of anarchists got together in order to write an FAQ
refuting the claims of certain "libertarian" capitalists to being
anarchists. Those who were involved in this project had spent many an
hour on-line refuting claims by these people that capitalism and
anarchism could go together. Finally, a group of net-activists decided
the best thing was to produce an FAQ explaining why anarchism hates
capitalism and why "anarcho" capitalists are not anarchists. However,
after the suggestion of Mike Huben (who maintains the ***"Critiques of
Libertarianism"*** web-page) it was decided that a pro-Anarchist FAQ
would be a better idea than an anti-"anarcho"-capitalist one. So the
Anarchist FAQ was born. It still bears some of the signs of its
past-history. For example it gives the likes of Ayn Rand, Murray
Rothbard, and so on, far too much space outside of Section F -- they
really are not that important. However, as they present extreme examples
of everyday capitalist ideology and assumptions, they do have their uses
-- they state clearly the authoritarian implications of capitalist
ideology which its more moderate supporters try to hide or minimise.

We think that we have produced a useful on-line resource for anarchists
and other anti-capitalists to use. Perhaps, in light of this, we should
dedicate this anarchist FAQ to the many on-line "libertarian"
capitalists who, because of their inane arguments, prompted us to start
this work. Then again, that would give them too much credit. Outside the
net they are irrelevant and on the net they are just annoying. As you
may guess, sections F and G contain the bulk of this early
anti-Libertarian FAQ and are included purely to refute the claim that an
anarchist can be a supporter of capitalism that is relatively common on
the net (in the real world this would not be required as almost all
anarchists think that "anarcho"-capitalism is an oxymoron and that its
supporters are not part of the anarchist movement).

So, while coming from a very specific reason, the FAQ has expanded into
more than we originally imagined. It has become a general introduction
about anarchism, its ideas and history. Because anarchism recognises
that there are no easy answers and that freedom must be based on
individual responsibility the FAQ is quite in-depth. As it also
challenges a lot of assumptions, we have had to cover a lot of ground.
We also admit that some of the "frequently asked questions" we have
included are more frequently asked than others. This is due to the need
to include relevant arguments and facts which otherwise may not have
been included.

We are sure that many anarchists will not agree 100% with what we have
written in the FAQ. That is to be expected in a movement based upon
individual freedom and critical thought. However, we are sure that most
anarchists will agree with most of what we present and respect those
parts with which they do disagree with as genuine expressions of
anarchist ideas and ideals. The anarchist movement is marked by
wide-spread disagreement and argument about various aspects of anarchist
ideas and how to apply them (but also, we must add, a wide-spread
tolerance of differing viewpoints and a willingness to work together in
spite of minor disagreements). We have attempted to reflect this in the
FAQ and hope we have done a good job in presenting the ideas of all the
anarchist tendencies we discuss.

We have no desire to write in stone what anarchism is and is not.
Instead the FAQ is a starting point for people to read and learn for
themselves about anarchism and translate that learning into direct
action and self-activity. By so doing, we make anarchism a living
theory, a product of individual and social self-activity. Only by
applying our ideas in practice can we find their strengths and
limitations and so develop anarchist theory in new directions and in
light of new experiences. We hope that the FAQ both reflects and aids
this process of self-activity and self-education.

We are sure that there are many issues that the FAQ does not address. If
you think of anything we could add or feel you have a question and
answer which should be included, get in contact with us. The FAQ is not
our "property" but belongs to the whole anarchist movement and so aims
to be an organic, living creation. We desire to see it grow and expand
with new ideas and inputs from as many people as possible. If you want
to get involved with the FAQ then contact us. Similarly, if others
(particularly anarchists) want to distribute all or part of it then feel
free. It is a resource for the movement. For this reason we have
"copylefted" An Anarchist FAQ (see
[http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/copyleft.html](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/copyleft.html)
for details). By so doing we ensure that the FAQ remains a free product,
available for use by all.

One last point. Language has changed a lot over the years and this
applies to anarchist thinkers too. The use of the term "man" to refer to
humanity is one such change. Needless to say, in today's world such
usage is inappropriate as it effectively ignores half the human race.
For this reason the FAQ has tried to be gender neutral. However, this
awareness is relatively recent and many anarchists (even the female ones
like Emma Goldman) used the term "man" to refer to humanity as a whole.
When we are quoting past comrades who use "man" in this way, it
obviously means humanity as a whole rather than the male sex. Where
possible, we add "woman", "women", "her" and so on but if this would
result in making the quote unreadable, we have left it as it stands. We
hope this makes our position clear.

So we hope that this FAQ entertains you and makes you think. Hopefully
it will produce a few more anarchists and speed up the creation of an
anarchist society. If all else fails, we have enjoyed ourselves creating
the FAQ and have shown anarchism to be a viable, coherent political
idea.

We dedicate this work to the millions of anarchists, living and dead,
who tried and are trying to create a better world. An Anarchist FAQ was
officially released on July 19th, 1996 for that reason -- to celebrate
the Spanish Revolution of 1936 and the heroism of the Spanish anarchist
movement. We hope that our work here helps make the world a freer place.
